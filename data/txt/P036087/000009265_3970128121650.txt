STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Partial Credit Guarantee Project Summary
Borrower/Guarantor:         Government of Lebanon (GOL).
Implementing Agencies:      Electricite du Liban (EDL) and Ministry of Hydraulic and
Electric Resources (MHER).
Beneficiaries:              EDL, GOL, urban and rural customers
Amount:                     Loan:       US$65 million
Guarantee: US$100 million
Terms:                      Loan: Standard variable interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single-
currency loans payable in 9 years, including 9 years of grace (bullet
repayment).
Guarantee: Non-accelerable guarantee of repayment of principal at
maturity, for a 10-year Eurobond priced at an indicative spread of 95-
100 bp above 10-year US Treasuries with a tranche placed in the US
under SEC Rule 144-A.
Relending Terms:            Loan: GOL would relend to EDL US$64.5 million of the loan at the
prevailing Bank interest rate with repayment of principal in nine and a
half (91/2) years, including four and a half (4V2) years of grace. US$0.5
million of the loan amount would be used by MHER to finance activities
related to the restructuring of the sector and the establishment of a
regulatory framework.
Guarantee: GOL would re-lend the entire proceeds to EDL, net of
underwriting fees, commissions and guarantee fee.
Commitment Fee:             0.75 percent per annum on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days
after signing, less any waiver.
Guarantee Fee:              0.25 percent per annum charged against the Bank's guarantee exposure,
represented by the present value of the guaranteed amount at maturity,
payable in advance in one lump-sum by GOL at financial closure date.
Co-financiers:              European Investment Bank (EIB); Islamic Development Bank (IDB);
Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).

signing, less any waiver.



ii                                                         Loan and Project Summary
Project Objectives and Description:
The objectives are to : (a) provide a high-voltage transmission system rebuilt to meet an integrated
system peak demand of approximately 1,500 MW at the N- I level of reliability ; and (b) assist GOL and
EDL to implement the Action Program in their Letter of Sectoral Development Policy (LSDP) which
provides for establishing and enabling environment for private sector involvement in the power sector,
including the institutional restructuring of the sector. The proposed Project comprises two elements: (a)
an investment component (US$480 million) which would include 339 km of double- and single-circuit
220-kV transmission lines, 49 km of underground 220-kV cables, and 14 new 220-kV substations; and
(b) an institutional development component (US$6 million) consisting of technical assistance for the
institutional reform action program defined in the LSDP.
Benefits:
The proposed Project would provide urgently needed transmission capacity without which EDL would
be unable to deliver power from its new facilities. Eliminating rotating power cuts and the risk of
unplanned blackouts have large indirect benefits as they prevent disruption to economic activity.
Without these investments and the accompanying institutional reforms, the improvements in electricity
supply recently achieved under the NERP would not be sustainable. The ability to provide reliable
public supply will lead to the shutdown of small, inefficient private generators. The main economic
benefit from the project is the incremental electricity demand served. There are also significant gains
from the reduction in technical energy losses resulting from related investment in distribution. The
institutional strengthening of EDL will re-establish sector analysis and planning. The proposed Project
will also restore the operating ability of a restructured and financially sound EDL to manage the new
transmission system. The financial recovery measures under the Project will put an end to reliance on
operating subsidies from the national budget and permit self-financing of a portion of its investment
program.
Risks:
The investment component of the proposed Project does not involve any unusual technical or
environmental risks.  Implementation will be on a turnkey basis, using prequalified international
contracting firms. The Project includes an institutional strengthening component to reduce the risks of
inadequate overall project management. The major risk facing the Project is political. Restructuring the
sector and delegating the bulk of EDL's operations to the private sector is key to achieving the
anticipated benefits earlier than under the status quo. Recruitment of private operators could be delayed
or hindered because of political constraints and/or public opposition. In assessing the preceding risks, it
is important to note that it is fully feasible, but not desirable, to continue EDL operations relying only on
internal reforms rather than under the unbundled structure proposed under the proposed Project.
Assuming however that given the political risks the govemment decides against restructuring EDL, the
investment component would still be viable in that it would permit the power stations at Zaharani and
Beddawi, currently under construction, to be connected to the transmission network. What would be lost
is expected financial viability of EDL in the near term. This is an innovative project in the Lebanese
context and the reform process may prove to be slower to implement than currently estimated. To
This norm requires that the transmission system design and its configuration be adequate to reliably meet peak
load demand, even in the event of the outage of any single element in the system.

mitigate this risk and in consideration of the non-blueprint nature of the proposed operation, close
project supervision and the use of afull mid-term review of implementation would be provided for under
the proposed Project.

LEBANESE REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION
EXPANSION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.1    Rebuilding and returning Lebanon's war-ravaged economy to sustainable growth involves three
phases: (i) short-term emergency rehabilitation; (ii) medium-term reconstruction; and (iii) long-term
expansion within the traditional market-based and outward-oriented policy framework. The phased-
recovery program envisions that much of the reconstruction will be undertaken by the private sector. In
accordance with this strategy, Lebanon embarked in late 1992 upon a three-year (1993-95), US$2.24
billion National Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP). This initial program covered a series of
high-impact rehabilitation investments, limited development of new facilities in priority areas, as well as
institutional strengthening and technical assistance elements. The NERP is supported by US$225 million
of Bank assistance through the Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project (ERRP),' including
a US$50 million supplement approved in May 1996, in the fields of power, water and waste water, solid
waste, education, housing and telecommunications. Re-establishing institutional capacity in the power
sector had not been specifically addressed under the NERP. Focusing attention on this aspect has now
become critical.
Energy Sector Context
1.2    Lebanon has no known fossil fuel resources.  Apart from relatively modest hydroelectric
resources and a newly-established power tie to Syria, all energy needs are met with imports of petroleum
products, which exceeded 4.1 million tons in 1995 (Annex 1.1). The power sector accounts for about a
third of fuel imports. There is considerable potential for use of solar energy, yet this source is virtually
unexploited. Annex 1.2 contains an Energy Balance for 1994.
Power Sector
1.3    Per capita electricity consumption, estimated at 1,460 kWh for 1995, is relatively high (see
Figure I below) in comparison with other countries in the region. It reflects, in part, a proliferation of
illegal connections during the 1980s and low tariffs. Consumption, however, is not out of line with non-
regional countries at similar levels of per capita GDP. All villages have been electrified and virtually all
households have access to electricity. Electricity is widely used for both water and space heating, partly
due to the lack of access to alternative fuels, such as natural gas and solar heaters. There is also
increasingly widespread use of air-conditioning, and system peak occurs in August.

1.4    The   electricity   supply
system is dominated by the state-
owned Electricitd du Liban (EDL), a        Figure 1: Per Capita Consumption
vertically  integrated  utility  with
approximately 800,000 customers.                       (kWh/Year)

private Kadisha company, which           Jordan         ,,
possessed  a concession  for the         Egypt
production and distribution of utility        0         500       1000      1500
power to about 100,000 consumers
in northern Lebanon (see Annex         Power Sector Statistics for Developing Countries 1987-91
1.4). Installed generation capacity is
about 1,389 MW (nameplate) of
which 265 MW is hydro-electric and 1,124 MW thermal. The 220-kV interconnection with Syria
permits imports of up to 100 MW. The system is interconnected at 150-kV and 66-kV and includes 58
HV substations totaling 1,620 MVA. Distribution is at 35-kV, 15-kV, II-kV and 5.5-kV, with an
installed transformer capacity of about 1,600 MVA.
1.5    At the end of the hostilities, the electric power subsector was characterized by a damaged and
dilapidated network and a fragile utility with an acute shortage of qualified staff. In particular, the
transmission system was heavily damaged. Daily rotating blackouts have been routine since the late
1980s, with supply to consumers severely rationed, as only 500 MW to 600 MW of plant was operational
versus a system demand of 1,100-1,300 MW. Most commercial and industrial customers and a
significant proportion of residential consumers installed privately-owned diesel generators.  An
aggregate of 600 to 800 MW of such small, inefficient units are thought to exist. In the absence of firm
data, privately-generated electricity is estimated at 1500 GWh annually, giving an average load factor of
21 percent for these generators. These non-utility systems are environmentally unsound and cannot be
expected to meet growth in demand. Furthermore, the extensive anarchic distribution networks
associated with them are not only unsafe but also an unsightly feature of the urban landscape. In early
1996, after EDL had been able to provide a 24-hour supply service to customers, the owners of these
back-up generators set in place to meet the shortfall in EDL's supplies were being persuaded to shut
them down.
Sector Rehabilitation
1.6    Under the NERP, over US$315 million was spent to rehabilitate generation, transmission and
distribution facilities. Works were selected to restore the bulk of pre-war nominal capacity through
repair and retrofitting, but did not provide new capacity. Priorities included restoring communication
links with the dispatching center; increasing the availability of existing generating stations;
reconstructing damaged transmission and distribution facilities; restoring public safety; and protecting
existing equipment from further damage. On completion of these works, it is expected that 24-hour
public supply would be provided to almost all regions. However, rehabilitated capacity (1,200 MW) will
not be sufficient to meet peak load, even with imports from Syria. System reliability will continue to be
inadequate and rationing unavoidable pending commissioning of new generation in 1997.

Re-establishing Financial Viability: Steps Undertaken and the Challenges Ahead
1.7    EDL has incurred losses for many years. Financial difficulties result from high technical and
non-technical losses, including those resulting from widespread illegal connections, coupled with loss of
control over its commercial operations, and low tariffs. In 1995, technical and non-technical losses
accounted for nearly 60 percent of production instead of a normal 10 to 12 percent for a comparable
system. The Government of Lebanon (GOL) and EDL are aware that tariffs need to be adjusted to
reflect costs, but deferred action until a credible plan began implementation to regain mastery of EDL's
commercial operations by: substantially reducing non-technical losses; improving collection ratios; and,
improving service quality to a level of service continuity of close to 24 hours/day. (The current tariff
structure is shown at Annex 1.5).  Recently, tariffs were increased when most of the plant being
rehabilitated (some 1,100 MW) entered service. Additional steps were taken starting late 1995 to deal
vigorously with billing weaknesses and non-technical losses. Turnkey contracts have been let to: (i)
verify metering and correctly bill all medium and high voltage customers - a measure that covers 2,000
consumers, accounting for approximately 25 percent of EDL's forecast revenues in 1996; (ii) normalize
metering installations for some 140,000 customers in two urban areas where non-technical losses are
disproportionately high; and (iii) install a new commercial billing and customer accounting system. In
addition, the contracting-out - under performance-based arrangements - of meter reading and revenue
collection activities has been let to 18 private agencies covering areas outside of Greater Beirut. Despite
these actions, EDL's losses in 1996 are forecasted at near US$150 million. Further tariff increases,
financial restructuring, and measures to deal with the systemic problems in commercial operations are
urgently required to accelerate the restoration of the sector.
Sectoral Strategy/Priority Policy Reform: Restructuring and the Unbundling of EDL
1.8    Consultants (funded by the Bank under the ERRP) recently completed a comprehensive
management audit of the sector. Problems identified include a legal framework that is no longer suited
to present circumstances; a severely weakened public utility, EDL, that suffers, inter alia, from a lack of
management autonomy; acute skill shortages; and weak financial and commercial practices. At the same
time, EDL is facing a major challenge in modernizing and expanding all aspects of its operations. The
consultants developed a menu of options to re-establish the viability of the sector, lost during the war.
Following a consultative process to discuss options and modalities for implementation with key
stakeholders, Government decided, in principle, to unbundle the main operational functions of EDL and
bring in private management to run generation and distribution. GOL's sectoral reform program is
discussed further below. In order to help introduce a competitive power market regulated by an
independent regulator with adequate powers, inter alia, to grant licenses and set tariffs and standards,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that, not later than January 1, 1998, the Government will
submit an appropriate draft electricity law to Parliament. The program is spelled out in detail in the
Letter of Sectoral Development Policy (LSDP)3 (Annex 1.3).
2   Effective March 1, 1996, the fixed charge component for all consumer categories was increased from
LLI,000/kVA to LL1,200/kVA and a three-part rate with an on-peak charge of US$0.20/kWh was set for large
consumers having a demand Ž300 kW. Effective October 1, 1996, a monthly rehabilitation surcharge that is
expected to yield US$30 million on an annual basis, came into effect as follows: small consumers (< 3kVA)
LL5,000/mo.; large consumers (> 3kVA) LLI0,000/mo.; industrial consumers LL200/kVA.
3   Approved by the Council of Ministers of the Lebanese Republic, under Resolution #3746, September 26,
1996.



4                                 Power Sector Restructuring and Transmission Expansion Project
1.9    The reform program includes: a set of sector-wide restructuring actions designed to introduce
competition along with the participation of the private sector in utility operations; and a set of actions to
deal with internal reform actions for EDL itself - to re-establish its financial viability and develop its
management capacity in line with its newly-defined mandate under the new, unbundled, sector structure.
Main elements of the overall reform program include:
*   unbundling  of the  vertically  integrated  national utility  into  separate  production,
transmission, and distribution functions;
*   privatization of these key functional areas in a program involving "affermage"4 and upon
approval by Parliament of the new electricity law, the establishment of several privately-
operated regional distribution concessions;
*   restructuring residual utility functions under the restructured EDL which would now serve
as an asset holding company (societe de patrimoine) while retaining the natural monopoly
functions of sector planning; bulk power contracting; transmission and generation dispatch;
*   introduction of two new laws: (a) a new sector electricity law; and (b) a new law and
statutes covering the restructured EDL. The former law will provide for a competitive
power market through the separation of electricity generation, transmission and distribution
functions, the participation of the private sector therein, and the establishment of an
autonomous regulatory body in the sector;
*   a vigorous program to dramatically cut non-technical losses (over 40% of production is
currently lost due to such causes) and to improve collections;
*   in harmony with the technical loss reduction and collection improvement program (para. 1.7
above) make effective a series of annual rate increases to achieve sector solvency by year
2000;
*   phase-out GOL subsidies - now exceeding US$100 million/year - that keep EDL afloat.
Interim subsidies for years 1996-99 will be treated as grants until sector solvency is
achieved;
*   establish institutional capacity using a Project Management Team to manage the US$486
million transmission construction program; and
*   the placement of a US$100 million GOL bond issue backed by the World Bank guarantee
facility to support the sector reconstruction and reform program.
1.10   GOL has indicated that sector unbundling will require new legislation. It is expected that a new
EDL Law will be submitted to Parliament in 1998 allowing the utility to operate on a commercial basis;
and would, inter alia, authorize the lease of assets on a long-term basis to private operators. However,
preparation of bidding documents for the leasing contracts is underway. It is important to note that key
initial steps of the reform program have already been implemented. Namely: the recapitalization of EDL
(US$450 million of GOL debt has been converted to equity); the restoration of the Kadisha concession;
and the letting of management contracts to perform meter-reading and collection activities (para 1.7).
Affermage or "operational contracting "- a contractual leasing arrangement under which the private operator
("termier") leases state assets, and operates the facilities using his own working capital. Depending on
contractual arrangements, new investments needed to operate/expand the leased facilities may be financed by
the fermier.

Sectoral Investment Program
1.11   National reconstruction - following the initial NERP phase - includes very substantial
investments in power. The 1995-2002 sectoral investment program is estimated at US$2.2 billion
(including physical and price contingencies). Forty-seven percent of the power program is for new
generation projects, totaling approximately 1,000 MW, and it provides for the overdue replacement of
about 200 MW of non-repairable capacity as well as additions to meet demand growth. Reinforcement
of the transmission system accounts for a further 31 percent of the program, while distribution represents
18 percent. Implementation of the program is concentrated in the early years, due to the backlog of
investment which could not be carried out during the war. The Government has proceeded with these
capacity additions, as it considers them essential to providing utility-quality power supply throughout
Lebanon and to be vital for the nation's economic recovery.
Rationalefor Bank Involvement
1.12   The proposed Project constitutes a logical follow-up to the emergency rehabilitation of the
electricity sector under the ERRP. It is also essential to the satisfactory completion of the power system
facilities rehabilitated under the NERP and to assure their sustainability. GOL has requested the support
of the Bank to assist it in designing a modern institutional and regulatory framework for the sector and in
mobilizing external resources for reconstruction. The former involves a step-by-step process which will
take several years to put in place. Without the specialized technical support that the Bank is able to
provide, it is likely that the process of institutional renewal would be postponed, putting at risk the entire
sector reconstruction effort. The Bank would play a catalytic role in establishing a credible policy
environment conducive to the attraction of private sector operators (key to the sustainability of
reconstruction of the sector) and in coordinating support from other donors and export credit agencies.
Through the support provided by the proposed Project for the implementation of the LSDP Action
Program, conditions for efficiency and quality of service improvements would be created, enabling the
private sector to play a major role in sector operations and possibly also in future investment. The
proposed Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on June 29,
1994, which calls for Bank support for reconstruction of basic infrastructure and for a private-sector-led
economic recovery.
1.13   The proposed Project and underlying policy reforms are consistent with the Bank's guidelines
for lending in the power sector. These call for shifting the role of governments from ownership and
management to policy-making and regulation, promoting efficiency and quality through
commercialization of operational activities and competitive provision of services. Finally, the proposed
Project is an essential part of a comprehensive and integrated sector investment program needed to re-
establish utility service in the entire country. Absent the timely construction of a reliable backbone
transmission system, remaining investments (near US$1.7 billion) now underway in power plants and
distribution facilities would not only become redundant, but would result in financial drain on the
economy.
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement
1.14   Implementation experience under the ERRP has been good. Institutional development and
reform, particularly when it involves legislation, is expected to take a period of several years because of
the need to develop political consensus. GOL and EDL are committed to reform, but this must proceed
flexibly at its own pace. In this current context, it is more appropriate to agree on a broad framework for
reform of the sector, rather than on a set of detailed milestones in an ambitious action program. GOL has



6                               Power Sector Restructuring and Transmission Expansion Project
been increasingly relying on the private sector to accelerate reconstruction as well as to put in place
needed institutional capacity to operate new facilities. These policies are fully consistent with the
proposed restructuring/unbundling of EDL to be supported in the proposed operation, as well as with the
Bank's 1992 policy guidelines for lending in the power sector.
2. THE BENEFICIARY
Legal Framework
2.1    Historically, power supply in Lebanon was entrusted to private concessions, a few of which still
exist. EDL, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, is the result of the acquisition by the state in 1954 of a
number of private electricity concessions. In its present form, EDL was created under a 1964 decree5
that entrusts it with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Lebanon.
2.2    Under the 1964 decree, EDL is constituted as a government-owned company with financial and
administrative autonomy and is entitled to operate on a commercial basis. Its Board of Directors has
seven members, appointed by the Government. Board powers, spelled out in part in a 1972 decree
applicable to all such enterprises,6 are broad and include the formulation of company policy, personnel
statutes, as well as the approval of budgets, work programs, tariffs and significant contracts.
2.3    According to the 1972 decree, Board decisions are subject to subsequent approval of the MHER,
which exercises the tutelage. Furthermore, a Ministry of Finance (MoF) representative, attends all Board
meetings, and, through the Ministry of Finance, approves all significant financial decisions. In recent
years, the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which assumed the duties of the
Ministry of Planning and took charge of the rehabilitation of Lebanese infrastructure following the war,
has entered into contracts well in excess of US$800 million involving new power plants, as well as the
rehabilitation of EDL's electrical installations throughout Lebanon. Finally, a number of Government
bodies oversee various aspects of EDL's operations. In short, for all practical purposes, parties other
than EDL are active in the power sector, and EDL itself enjoys minimal autonomy in all important
functional areas.
2.4    The legal framework under which EDL operates has been the subject of a detailed assessment
(para. 1.8) which concluded, inter alia, that: (i) it lacked clarity due to a plethora of inconsistent laws and
decrees; (ii) its framework was too rigid, and thus was unresponsive to the requirements of a modern
power utility; and (iii) it restricted private sector involvement. After a review of viable options, the
consultant recommended that the legal framework under which EDL operates be modernized and new
statutes enacted. The LSDP provides that a new EDL Law will be submitted to Parliament in 1998
allowing the utility to operate on a commercial basis.
Organization, Management and Staffing
2.5    The Board of EDL takes a leading role in the formulation of company policy; the General
Manager is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the utility. EDL was recently reorganized into ten
Decree No. 16878 of July 10, 1964.
6   Decree No. 4517 of December 13, 1972.



Power Sector Restructuring and Transmission Expansion Project                                7
functional Departments (Annex 2.1). 7 The structure is not effective given the excessive number of
Directors reporting directly to the General Manager. The ten senior positions are manned, but many
middle-management positions are vacant as there are no suitable candidates within the organization, and
external recruitment has been prohibited by GOL.
2.6    EDL has some 3,040 staff, of which two-thirds are regular employees, and while the balance are
on temporary status, most have worked in the company for decades. EDL has not been permitted to
recruit new staff since 1983, and therefore the average age is high (about 48.3 years). Motivation is low
given salary levels, in most cases only slightly above the minimum legal wage in the country. Moreover,
as a result of many departures, managers and professionals make up only about 4 percent of the staff,
compared to an industry norm of 10 percent. Furthermore, as a result of the restructuring of the sector,
there will be inevitable reductions in the number of EDL staff (the majority of the work force affected by
the transfer to the private sector would likely be retained by the new operators). In all, redeployment will
have to be handled with due sensitivity, fully taking into consideration matters such as retraining,
separation benefits, and pension rights. In order to address the issue, a manpower study is expected to be
carried out during 1997.
2.7    With respect to training programs, these have to be designed taking into account the manpower
profile of the utility, and the plans for the future. In EDL's case, priority has been given to hiring outside
expertise, particularly from Electricite de France (EdF), which has been supporting EDL in several areas
including project management and the loss reduction program. EDL intends to recruit during 1997
expertise in financial management and in specific technical areas to strengthen its teams and provide on-
the-job training to its own personnel. This training strategy is satisfactory.
Accounts andAudit
2.8    EDL accounts are maintained in accordance with the French Accounting Code of 1957, and have
not yet been adapted to the Lebanese accounting code of 1981. During the war years, accounts were
maintained but closure of books occurred long after each accounting period. After significant efforts and
with the help of its auditors, heavily qualified accounts were submitted for 1992-95.  During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that EDL will continue to have its accounts audited by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and that audited accounts shall be submitted to the Bank
not later than nine months after the end of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and six months after the end of
fiscal year 1998 and thereafter.
Insurance
2.9    EDL does not maintain insurance coverage against major risks for its facilities. In order to
address this issue, assurances were obtained at negotiations that EDL will, not later than September 30,
1997, undertake a risk assessment study in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,
to provide a basis for formulating its policies regarding insurance coverage.
The reorganization was formalized in a Govemment Decree (No. 16861 of January 10, 1995).

Action Plan
2.10   Under the restructuring program (para. 1.9), EDL would be converted to a holding company
retaining operational responsibility for transmission and generation dispatch, as well as system planning.
GOL intends to: (i) contract out the new power plants of Beddawi and Zaharani, both to be
commissioned in early 1997, to experienced private firms under, initially, short-term and subsequently,
long-term risk-based contracts ("affermage"); (ii) contract out the older power plants of Jieh and Zouk
under operation and maintenance contracts; (iii) have the new gas turbines (Baalbeck and Tyre),
commissioned in early 1996, operated initially by the suppliers, and subsequently by specialized
operators; (iv) divide Lebanon into approximately five distribution zones, each to be contracted out to a
specialized firm; and (v) partially privatize the Kadisha concession, which is now an EDL subsidiary.
The involvement of private operators in the power sector for periods in excess of five years requires an
amendment to the laws and statutes under which EDL operates (para. 2.4). Such an amendment will be
submitted to the Parliament in 1998. The broad policy framework for the restructuring of the sector is
set in the LSDP.
2.11   The above measures would have a considerable impact on EDL, in particular with respect to
personnel (para. 2.6). The consultants estimate that the restructured EDL would need approximately
400-500 staff;9 some of the remaining staff would be employed by the private operators (particularly
those from EDL's present generation and distribution operations).
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.1    The objectives are to : (a) expand the high-voltage transmission system to meet an integrated
system peak demand of approximately 1,500 MW at the N-1 level of reliability ; and (b) assist the
Borrower to implement the Action Program in the LSDP which provides for establishing an enabling
environment for private sector involvement in the power sector, including the institutional restructuring
of the sector.
Project Description
3.2    The proposed Project comprises two elements: (a) an investment component (US$480 million or
98.8 percent of the Project cost), which would include 339 km of double- and single-circuit 220-kV
transmission lines, 49 km of underground 220-kV cables, and 14 new 220-kV substations; and (b) an
institutional development component (US$6 million or 1.2 percent) consisting of technical assistance for
project implementation, training and assistance to implement the institutional reform action program
defined in GOL's LSDP. Details of the planned routes of the 220-kV lines and cables, and the locations
of substations and major generation stations are shown in the map attached (Map IBRD 26093).
Technical aspects of the investment component appear in Annex 3. 1.
EDL considers that it would require 600-800 staff.
0  This norm requires that the transmission system design and its configuration be adequate to reliably meet peak
load demand, even in the event of the outage of any single element of the system.

Project Financing
3.4    The proposed Project is to be financed by buyers' credits (about US$130 million), commercial
loans (US$ 79 million), the European Investment Bank (US$20 million), the French Protocol (US$5
million), the Islamic Development Bank (US$31 million), a Bank loan (US$65 million) and Bank-Partial
Credit Guarantee Bond (US$100 million). Both the EIB and the IDB loans have been approved. The
proposed Bank loan would be onlent by GOL to EDL at IBRD terms. Signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement between GOL and EDL, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition of
Loan effectiveness. In the event of delay in obtaining adequate financing, assurances were obtained at
negotiations from the Government that the proceeds from the bond sale would be applied directly to
project costs and the period of project implementation adjusted accordingly.
3.5    GOL has opted for a bullet maturity of 9 years (from the first interest payment date) for the Bank
loan with 9 years of grace in lieu of standard country terms (17 years maturity including 5 years of
grace). The Bank's current policy allows for an extension of the grace period with a reduction in the
total maturity on country or project grounds (in a I to 2 ratio, for a maximum, as in this case, of a 4-year
extension of grace, and an 8-year reduction in total maturity). The relevant country grounds are that over
the next 4 to 6 years, Lebanon will continue to have large post-war reconstruction needs while a sizable
portion of the current public debt - most of which is domestic - will fall due. The Government's
strategy is to contain the growth of total public debt through fiscal adjustment, including improved cost
recovery, e.g., as in the power sector via the proposed Project. The modified terms would help towards
achieving the adjustment in a sustainable manner by deferring amortization obligations to a time by
which reconstruction investment will have been completed, the fiscal deficit will have been reduced, and,
based on projected rapid medium-term growth, the total public-debt-to-GDP ratio will have declined.
Under the on-lending arrangements, GOL would require EDL to begin amortizing the subsidiary loan
after four years of grace in order to ensure financial discipline in its operations. Finally, GOL opted for a
single currency US-dollar loan, due in part to the fact that EDL tariffs are in Lebanese Pounds, which are
linked to the US dollar under current policy.

3.6    A partial credit guarantee for a US$100 million bond issue is proposed to help mobilize the
necessary financing to fund the financing gap for the proposed Project. The guarantee would also help to
catalyze private financing for the power sector through debt financing from the capital markets. EDL is
not a creditworthy entity. Poor financial performance and the state of its financial records make it
virtually impossible for EDL to access the commercial capital markets under its own name. Therefore, it
is proposed that while EDL is undergoing restructuring and the sector reforms are in progress, GOL
would borrow on behalf of EDL to maximize the terms of the borrowing sought under the partial credit
guarantee. This would be the first guarantee operation in the country. Following market soundings
among a cross section of financial institutions, it was determined that a bond issue would result in more
favorable terms than a syndicated loan. The proposed partial credit guarantee would support a 10-year
Eurobond Issue with a tranche placed in the United States under the SEC's Rule 144-A. The Bank's
partial credit guarantee would cover 1 00 percent of principal repayment, on a non-accelerable basis, with
the interest payment risk being undertaken by private investors. A counter-guarantee is to be be
provided by GOL.
3.7    Rationale and Benefits of the Proposed Guarantee: The partial credit guarantee operation
would provide EDL with long-term funds and would facilitate mobilization of the foreign exchange
required for the completion of the proposed Project. Since the bond would be issued by the Lebanese
Republic, EDL would be able to access the market for reasonable maturities and terms while it is
undergoing restructuring. The Bank's guarantee support would result in significant additionality in terms
of mobilizing longer maturities and narrower margins and in broadening the existing investor base for
Lebanese debt. The proposed partial credit guarantee operation would extend maturity significantly to
10 years.  A guarantee operation would also help initiate GOL's access to long-term  funds in
international markets. In contrast, GOL's recent borrowings from international markets have been of
short maturities, between 3-5 years. Through the leveraging effect of the partial credit guarantee, the
market would be encouraged to assume Lebanese sovereign risk for a longer credit period by assuming
the interest payment risk. The proposed operation is intended also to broaden the investor base to
include international institutional investors, thereby helping to diversify the country's borrowing sources,
an important consideration given the country's large investment requirements.
3.8    The guarantee would represent credit support from the Bank of about 52 percent in present value
terms of the total funds mobilized through the bond issue. These benefits are important to Lebanon,
given the country's large infrastructure investment requirements.  Based on the evaluation of the
financing proposals and the award of the conditional mandate, Board approval is being requested for the
partial guarantee. Following Board approval, GOL and the Bank would enter into negotiations with the
lead bank to conclude the relevant documentation for the guarantee financing . Once these negotiations
are completed, the Board will be informed of the terms and conditions of the guarantee prior to the
launching of the bond issue. If as a result of these negotiations, the terms and conditions of the bond
issue and guarantee were to be materially different from that reflected in Annex 3.8, Board approval for
the revised documentation would be sought.
3.9    The Project financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2.
II
Documentation for the guarantee would include: Offering Circular; Subscription Agreement; Fiscal Agency
Agreement; Trust Deed and Bonds; Warranty Agreement; Indemnity Agreement; Articles of Consent for
Currency and Markets; and Statutory Committee Report.

Procurement: Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
3.10   For bidding purposes, the 220-kV transmission project was divided into three components: lines,
underground cables and substations.  To facilitate financing and encourage competition, the bid
documents were packaged into eight lots and were based on turnkey, supply-erect-commission contracts
for: transmission lines (three lots); underground cables (two lots); and substations (three lots).
3.11   Because of the different procurement procedures of cofinanciers, it was decided to use parallel
financing for individual procurement packages. The Bank would finance a portion of the costs of the
Baalbeck 220-kV substation (Lot No. 3) and of the 220-kV underground cables connecting the IPC and
Bahsas substations (Lot No. 2). Bid documents, which had previously been reviewed by the Bank and
found to be acceptable, were issued to prequalified bidders, who had also been selected in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Bids received were evaluated by EDL in February 1996. Contract award is
pending.
3.12   Procurement will be in accordance with the Bank's Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. The
CDR, which has considerable experience in Bank-financed procurement, is managing procurement
activities under the proposed Project. Procurement arrangements for the Bank-financed components are
summarized in Table 3.3. All contracts for underground cables and substations exceeding US$5.0
million have been or will be subject to prior review by the Bank. For Bank-financed consulting services,
contracts exceeding US$100,000 for firmns (US$50,000 for employment of individual consultants) would
also be subject to prior review. During negotiations, assurances were obtained with GOL on the above
procurement arrangements.
3.13   The first units of the two combined cycle power plants at Zaharani and Beddawi are scheduled to
be commissioned in mid-1997. Even if the transmission contracts are awarded by end of 1996, the
transmission system would only be partially completed when the new generation is on line. To meet the
power plant construction schedule and minimize lag before the transmission system can evacuate power
from the new stations, advance procurement actions and advance contracting are being followed.
Retroactive financing by the Bank is required and would cover expenditures incurred after August 1,
1996.  However, the retroactive financing would cover only those expenditures falling within a
maximum period of 12 months prior to the expected date of loan agreement signing.

Disbursements
3.14   The Bank loan would be used to finance technical assistance and the following items: (a) goods,
materials, construction and installation of the 220-kV substations at Saida and Baalbeck, including power
transforners, switchgear, protection and control, insulators, etc.; and (b) goods, materials, construction
and installation of the 220-kV underground cables between the IPC and Bahsas substations, including
power and fiber optic cables, joints, and termination equipment. A disbursement profile is provided in
Table 3.4. Disbursements would be made against full documentation for contracts for underground
cables and substations exceeding US$5 million and, for consulting services, for contracts exceeding
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. For contracts below these limits disbursements
would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).
3.15   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government will
open a Special Account in its Central Bank to be operated by EDL under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The authorized allocation to the Special Account will be US$6.0 million.
During the start of the proposed Project, EDL may request up to US$3.0 million as an initial deposit to
the Special Account. After disbursements and commitments from the loan account have reached US$8.0
million, EDL may request the balance of the authorized allocation. EDL would submit replenishment
applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special Account
balance has been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment applications will be supported by the
necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation statement of the
Special Account against the Bank's records. The Special Account would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to the
Bank for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained on the above provisions for the operation and auditing of the Special Account.

3.16   A schedule of disbursements based on a projected effectiveness date of March 1, 1997 is given in
Annex 3.3. It is anticipated that the Project will require about 5 years to complete, with a target
completion date of December 31, 2002. The loan closing date is June 30, 2003, six months after the
Project completion date.
Implementation Arrangements
3.17   With the exception of procurement (to be done under the control of the CDR), EDL will be
responsible for the implementation of the transmission expansion program. All eight contract packages
(para. 3.10) must be executed in parallel to meet the implementation schedule (Annex 3.4). Significant
field supervision will be necessary, given the geographically dispersed nature of transmission system
construction activities. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a Project Management Team
(PMT) will be established within EDL. The PMT will be required to undertake monitoring of quality
assurance, project schedules and costs, to approve payments to contractors, and to coordinate activities
under the eight contracts. For effective management, at least three project implementation groups will be
set up, one for each main discipline (transmission lines, underground cables and substations) with each
group having a project engineer reporting to the head of the PMT for overall coordination.
3.18   The PMT will require the services of an outside consulting firm during implementation of the
proposed Project. EDL will employ five to ten consultant staff over the construction period, including a
senior project manager, electrical, civil and commissioning engineers, and costing, scheduling and
procurement/inspection specialists. Along with project management responsibilities, the consultants'
mandate will include ensuring that the EDL counterpart staff become an integral part of the PMT. As
part of the contract, the consultant will also have to provide on-the-job training of counterpart staff in
project administration, contract monitoring and control, quality assurance of material supply and its
installation/construction, all to the specified standards.
3.19   The above construction management services are to be financed by the French Protocol. A single
contract is to be let to Electricite de France. A draft outline for the terms of reference for the PMT is
attached as Annex 3.5. Agreement to retain this assistance in project management during project
implementation was obtained at negotiations.

Training
3.20   Training of EDL staff in the areas of operations and maintenance, studies and engineering,
project implementation and financial management is urgently required (see para. 2.7 above). The
integration of EDL staff with the implementation of the generation, transmission, distribution,
communication, dispatch center projects presently underway (or soon to be awarded) will provide an
excellent opportunity for staff training. Provisions in the various project contracts have been made to
ensure that a training component is included with project implementation. EDL has a training plan under
preparation. The training plan was reviewed and agreed to at negotiations.
Supervision and Monitoring
3.21   The proposed Project would require careful coordination and frequent supervision by the Bank,
particularly in the initial years of its execution. Monitoring the institutional performance would involve
the MHER, EDL, and the ad-hoc committee set up for the review of the institutional consultancy.
Overall coordination and report preparation would be carried out by EDL. Quarterly progress reports
would be submitted to EDL's Board of Directors, the CDR, the Bank and cofinanciers. Detailed
reporting requirements were finalized during negotiations. An annual review of the implementation of
all aspects of the proposed Project, including achievement of agreed performance targets, would be
undertaken by EDL, as well as a mid-term review of its execution, to be conducted not later than
November 30, 1998. Representatives of the cofinanciers will be invited to participate in the reviews. At
the end of the proposed Project, EDL will present an Implementation Completion Report, no later than
six (6) months after the closing date of the Loan.
3.22   It is estimated that three supervision missions in years one and two, and two per year thereafter
would be required during project execution - a total of 10 missions. Given the innovative nature of the
institutional restructuring component, a full mid-term implementation review is planned. Total staffing
requirements for supervision would be approximately 60 staffweeks, divided among specialists in
transmission engineering and financial, institutional and legal matters. A Supervision Plan is given in
Annex 3.6, which contains a set of performance indicators for monitoring and supervision of the
proposed Project.
Environmental Aspects
3.23   For environmental reporting purposes, the proposed Project is designated as a Category B
project. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and related report were prepared.
The scope of the review conducted during project preparation included the two new power plants as well
as the new transmission system - lines, substations, and cables. The decision to follow as much as
possible the rights-of-way of existing transmission lines minimizes the potential impact of opening up
new access roads and impacts related to land acquisition. The use of compact gas-insulated substations
minimizes potential noise and land use impacts in urban areas. The mitigation plan proposes the
following actions at the construction stage: (i) payment of adequate compensation for rights-of-way,
tower and substation sites, including allocations for crops and woodlands; (ii) line alignment designed to
minimize interference with agricultural land; (iii) tower heights reduced whenever possible, especially in
mountainous areas; (iv) maximum use of existing roads and village tracks for access to tower/substation
sites; (v) use of existing rights-of-way wherever possible; (vi) revegetation of new access roads and
tower sites after construction; and (vii) procedures for contractors to follow in case of archaeological
finds. During the operationalphase, actions will include: (i) periodic line testing, insulator cleaning and
parts replacement maintenance; (ii) routine inspections for erosion control at tower sites and steep



Power Sector Restructuring and Transmission Expansion Project                            15
slopes; and (iii) selective hand clearance of vegetation along rights-of-way and at substation sites. The
EIA has been reviewed by EDL, GOL and the Bank. Environmental aspects of the proposed Project are
considered to be satisfactorily addressed and are in compliance with current environmental policies and
procedures. The proposed Project has been designed in accordance with current technological practices
and it is expected to cause minimum disturbance to the environment. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations from EDL that it would carry out the environmental management plan in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
4. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
4.1    EDL is behind in closing its accounts, and does not have appropriate costing, budgeting and
budgetary control systems (para. 2.8). With the help of its auditors, EDL was able to close the books for
1992-95, which were subsequently audited. The auditors' reports were heavily qualified. During 1996,
some of EDL's Government debt was converted into equity, and liabilities incurred by CDR on behalf of
the power sector (para. 2.3) were assumed by EDL. The 1995 balance sheet was subsequently restated to
reflect these decisions. Under the circumstances, the assessment of EDL's financial position and
prospects presented herewith, which was supported by consultant's analyses (para. 2.4), should be
considered as tentative.
4.2    Financial Standing. Financial statements for EDL's in recent years appear in Annex 4.1. Past
income statements, restated in US$ terms, are summarized as follows:

As can be seen from the above table, EDL's financial performance in recent years has been
unsatisfactory. The key reasons include: (i) sizable levels of electrical losses -- out of 54 percent of
unaccounted-for electricity, only 15 percent could be explained by technical considerations - the balance
is due to unrecorded consumption in one form or another; (ii) an inadequate billing system resulting in a
high level of non-payment;14 and, (iii) inadequate tariffs.

As can be seen from the above, during 1992-94 EDL was in a precarious financial condition, given its
level of indebtedness and inadequate liquidity. It was unable to pay for fuel used to produce electricity
and Government financed these during years through treasury advances. In recognition of the ambitious
forthcoming investment program, and of the need to make EDL the focal entity of the power sector, the
Government decided to recapitalize the utility. In particular, about LL 100 billion (US$60 million) of
Treasury advances, LL 60 billion (US$37 million) of overdue debt payments, and LL 495 billion
(US$310 million) of advances for fuel purchases were converted into equity.  Furthermore, EDL
assumed the indebtedness incurred by CDR for the power sector and took over the corresponding assets.
The above transactions are reflected in EDL's 1995 balance sheet, which shows a significant
improvement over the previous years.
14  The auditors have estimated that up to 30% of the billing outside Beirut has not been paid.

4.4    An area which still remains weak is the high level of arrears. This is explained by a combination
of the following: (i) inadequate consumer records; (ii) an absence of strict commercial policies (in
particular, no enforcement of payments when due), which is partly due to insufficient legislation'5; and
(iii) late billing. EDL is aware of the need to improve collections performance and has taken a number
of steps during 1996, including: (i) the sub-contracting of meter reading and collection;'6 (ii) the
establishment of appropriate records, and billing procedures for the approximately 2,000 medium- and
higher- voltage connections, which account for 20% of the power market; and (iii) the systematic
recording of all consumers and the establishment of appropriate records and billing procedures in two
suburbs of Beirut with 140,000 connections. These efforts are supported in part by technical assistance
from EdF (para. 2.7). Lastly, in connection with the 1996 accounts, EDL will recognize some of the
arrears as unrecoverable, which it will write off. However, the restoration of commercial discipline in
general, and the reduction of arrears to acceptable levels in particular, will constitute major challenges
for EDL and the authorities in the coming years.
Financial Forecasts
4.5    The future financial performance of EDL will depend on a number of factors, including its
ability to raise tariffs, to reduce losses and improve collections (para. 4.4 above), and to operate its plants
and other facilities efficiently, including through private operators (para. 2.10). The financial recovery
of EDL will be particularly challenging, given that it will coincide with a major investment program,
estimated over the period 1996-2002 at US$2.1 billion, which will be largely financed by debt. The
latter represents a three-fold increase in EDL's assets.
4.6    With respect to tariff levels, as mentioned in para 1.7 above, GOL and EDL deferred action until
a credible plan began implementation to regain mastery of EDL's commercial operations (reducing non-
technical losses; improving collection ratios, and; improving service quality to a level of service
continuity of close to 24 hours/day). In this light the authorities have decided on a number of measures
including: (i) in March 1996, fixed charges were increased by 20 percent, and a three-part tariff was
introduced for industrial consumers (largely to discourage consumption at peak hours); (ii) in October
1996, tariffs were adjusted through the introduction of a rehabilitation surcharge which is expected to
yield US$30 million on an annual basis; and (iii) in March 1997, all tariff categories will be increased by
the equivalent of LL 10/kWh (US¢0.6/kWh). These adjustments are expected to result in an overall
increase of 20% over the 1995 tariffs. Taking into account the anticipated levels of electricity losses and
unpaid consumption, these will not suffice to achieve solvency on a cash basis. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that all measures will be taken to enable EDL to produce revenues equivalent
to cash operating expenses and debt service not later than January 1, 2000.17 Furthermore, EDL will aim
to attain self-financing ratios of not less than 10% in 2001, 15% in 2002 and 30% in 2003 and beyond.
Lastly, EDL intends to introduce during 1998 a fuel adjustment clause in its tariffs.
4.7    The structure of tariffs do not reflect the cost of supply by consumer category In this respect,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that not later than January 1998, a tariff study will be
5  It is expected that during 1997 legislation will be passed equating the illegal use of electricity to theft.
16  It should be noted that under this arrangement, the responsibility for consumer records, bills preparation, and
when required, disconnections, remains with EDL.
17 The Government has confirmed that it will provide EDL with subsidies over 1996-1999 to cover financial
shortfalls.

supply to different consumer groups; (ii) provide life-line tariffs for low income groups; and (iii)
encourage energy conservation.
4.8    Financial projections over 1996-2002 appear at Annex 4.1; supporting assumptions are at Annex
4.2. The projections are predicated on: (i) a gradual improvement in EDL's ability to reduce losses and
recover payments when due; (ii) the investment program being largely financed by debt until 2000; 18
(iii) annual subsidies covering the revenue shortfall necessary to cover operating expenses (excluding
depreciation) and debt service; and (iv) annual tariff adjustments from 1998 onwards, sufficient to attain
solvency in 2000. The results are highlighted in Table 4.3 below:

the annual tariff adjustment would increase from about 8 percent annually over 1998-2000 to 12 percent
annually during the same years.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Demand and Energy Forecasts
5.1    Under present circumstances, demand and energy forecasts are subject to an unusually high
degree of uncertainty due to the state of the system and unknown consumer demand. In addition,
provision of electricity to residential consumers by the 'informal sector' was extensive during the war,
and continues today, although on a reduced scale. No authoritative data exist on the capacity installed or
the energy supplied by private generators. However, EDL's consultants20 have derived estimates that
suggest that the 'informal' sector had an installed capacity of about 600 MW and produced about 1,500
GWh in 1994-95.
5.2    The reliability of forecasts is exacerbated by the widespread phenomenon of illegal connections
and unmetered consumption. EDL's current losses are estimated to be approximately 54 percent, of
which only about 15 percent is due to technical factors. The remainder is attributed to weak commercial
and customer management practices.  Electricity consumption data by end-use category is very
approximate. Until unrestricted 24-hour public supply is achieved and consumer behavior has adapted
accordingly, the level of demand can only be surmised. During the past few years, several attempts have
been made by EDL and its consultants to prepare demand forecasts. Inevitably, these forecasts cover a
wide range: peak load for the year 2000 is in the range of 1,600-1,900 MW, compared to a projected
1996 peak of 1,350 MW. Electricity demand is projected to grow between 6-8 percent annually between
1995-2000, while the current Bank forecast of GDP growth over the same period is 8 percent.
Unrestricted supply and economic growth would tend to support a demand growth rate higher than that
of GDP, but the significant real price increases expected in the near term will have a dampening effect.
21
Considerable scope also exists for a number of demand-side management measures , which would also
tend to reduce the rate of growth. For purpose of the economic analysis of the proposed Project, a load
growth of 6 to 8 percent has been assumed.
System Planning
5.3    For the medium-term reconstruction and expansion of the power system, least-cost generation
and transmission expansion studies were carried out in 1993-94.   They proposed the addition of
approximately 1,000 MW of new power generation capacity by the end of the decade in order to reliably
meet23 a projected peak load of nearly 2,000 MW. Various technical alternatives of thermal plant were

examined in conjunction with three different fuel sources to determine the least-cost solution for firm
base-load supply. Diesel-fired combined-cycle gas turbine plants were found to be the most economic
choice. GOL selected two sites at opposite ends of the country for the simultaneous construction. While
the construction of one of these plants could have been deferred slightly, GOL felt that the risk of under-
estimating demand growth, the high age of existing generation plant,24 the attractively low bid prices and
the strategic need for balanced regional development justified the decision to build both plants at the
same time. Furthermore, existing interconnections with Syria provide opportunities for exporting any
surplus into the regional market. GOL hopes to convert the plants from diesel to natural gas in the
medium term.
5.4    Two combined-cycle gas turbine plants of 450 MW each are under construction, at Beddawi in
the north, and at Zaharani in the south.
The first modules (units) of these plants
are due in service in mid-1997.   In

5.5    The construction of a new 220-kV
double-circuit, 339 km long backbone ring
transmission network (see map) is also required to bring this power to consumers. A number of
alternative voltage levels were studied, including retention of the existing non-standard 150-kV level.
The 220-kV was found to be the optimal voltage, as it is an internationally recognized voltage level and
has the advantage of facilitating future regional interconnections. The 150-kV network is planned to be
plhased out and upgraded to operate at 220-kV. The transmission planning studies carried out so far
looked at a 7- to 10-year horizon instead of a 15 to 20-year time-frame as is normal utility planning
practice. This reflected the prevailing circumstances and the need for a crash reconstruction program.

Power Sector Restructuring and Transmission Expansion Project                                21
5.6    A formal distribution investment plan does not exist at present as planning work could not be
carried out due to lack of necessary statistical data for preparing realistic load forecasts. This activity
will be initiated rapidly so as to avoid the risk of having new generation and transmission facilities
commissioned with an inadequate distribution network for grid power.
5.7    A long-term (20 years) power system investment strategy will need to be developed in the next
one to two years for both transmission and distribution. EDL plans to approach donors offering
concessionary financing to arrange funding for these studies.
Benefits
5.8    The proposed Project would provide urgently needed transmission capacity in the power sector.
It is an integral part of the sector's priority investment program and without it, EDL will be unable to
deliver the output of the new generation plants needed to meet system  demand.  Without these
investments and the accompanying institutional reforms, the improvements in electricity supply recently
achieved under the NERP will not be sustainable. The advent of reliable power supplies will lead to the
shutdown of the diesels (para 1.5). These fuel savings alone have been estimated at nearly US$30
million annually.26
5.9    The main economic benefit from the proposed Project is the incremental electricity demand
served and the concomitant reduction in 'unserved' energy. However, the prevailing (1996) average
tariff of LL 92 (US$0.06/kWh), is well below full-cost recovery and does not reflect the benefits to
consumers of utility-grade electricity supply. In Lebanon, the willingness of even residential consumers
to pay extremely high rates for minimal,
low-quality electricity supply has been
clearly demonstrated. The informal sector
generators charge between US$3-45 per                        "Commercialized"
kVA on a monthly basis for supply varying       GWh
between 8 and 12 hours per day. This is
equivalent to  an  average  of LL  200        19000___

Equally importantly, the reduction in losses
will free up peak generation capacity of
about 100 MW, thereby allowing US$35
million of investment in new gas turbine units to be deferred. Except for the recent application of peak

now. Revisions to the tariff structure are expected to be introduced following the tariff study to be
carried out in 1998. They will help to discourage wasteful electricity consumption.
5.11   Beyond the reduction of technical losses, the commercialization of EDL will increase billed
sales proportionately faster than the overall increase in net production, as is seen from Figure 4. Billed
sales grow more than three fold from 1994 to 2000, i.e., from 2100 GWh to 7,280 GWh. Improvements
in system performance eliminate informal supplies and reduce the level of technical losses, while
commercial improvements serve to eliminate non-technical losses. Commercialization is a key element
to the recovery of the sector. The above efficiency gains along with the tariff actions under the Project
(para. 4.6) would eliminate reliance on direct public subsidies. The latter in 1996 alone are projected at
approximately US$166 million.
Non-Quantifiable Benefits
5.12   The shutdown of small, inefficient diesel generators in densely populated urban areas will help to
reduce air and noise pollution. The associated removal of the parallel overhead LV distribution network
will improve public safety as well as aesthetic benefits. Such environmental benefits have not been
quantified or included in the economic IRR calculations.
5.13   Eliminating rotating power cuts and the risk of unplanned system-wide blackouts have large
indirect benefits through the avoidance of the disruption to economic activity. No attempt has been
made to quantify these reliability benefits.
5.14   The institutional strengthening of EDL will improve sector analysis and planning, which have
played a minor role in recent years. The proposed Project will also strengthen the operating ability of a
restructured and financially sound EDL to manage the new transmission system. Finally, by assisting
with the establishment of a regulatory framework appropriate for private investors, the Project would
help reduce the sector's reliance on public funds for its investment requirements, as GOL envisages that
future large generation plants would be executed as IPPs.
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.15   An economic evaluation of the 1995-99 time-slice of the sectoral investment program  was
carried out, given the impossibility of attributing specific benefits to the construction of a ring
transmission network. Details are given in Annex 5.1.
5.16   The IRR of the base case understates the benefits from the Project because savings to consumers
from the shutdown of informal sector generators were not included. In the absence of the investment
program, EDL would be unable to supply all its consumers, and load shedding and frequent system-wide
blackouts would be unavoidable. Figure 5 illustrates the growth in unserved energy, which would reach
over 25 percent of system requirements by the year 2002 in the absence of new investments.28 Annex
5.1 provides a summary of energy supplies available with the existing system, which is limited to some
GWh 6,900/year.

5.17   At the current evening peak, EDL charges its industrial consumers US$0.20/kWh if they do not
cut their demand, as it has no
generation reserve margin. The cost
of unserved energy or of alternative
autogeneration is far greater than the      Figure 5: Blackouts Continue w/o Project

charged by the informal sector
(US$0.13/kWh  -  see  para. 5.9
above) the resulting IRR is 22.4 percent using base-case parameters.
5.18   The impact of a one-year delay in completing the transmission investments to be financed by the
proposed loan would be to lower the IRR by about 0.5 percent. A ten percent cost overrun on the
transmission component would have the same relatively minor impact. One of the main areas of
uncertainty, which has considerable influence on the IRR, is the forecast rate of growth in demand. The
impact of lower electricity demand under a low GDP growth scenario was therefore examined. Annual
average load growth of 6 percent over 1995-2000 with benefits valued at projected tariffs results in an
IRR of 13.5 percent. This shows that even if electricity demand falls short of the base-case forecast, the
IRR on the investment program would remain satisfactory. Only if electricity demand growth during
1996-2001 averages 4 percent or less (benefits at projected rates) does the IRR fall below ten percent.
The risk of such low demand growth is considered to be small.
Risks
5.19   The investment component of the Project does not involve any unusual technical or
environmental risks.  Implementation will be on a turnkey basis using prequalified international
contracting firms. Final costs are known with reasonable accuracy as bids have already been received.
The proposed Project includes an institutional strengthening component to reduce the risks of poor
overall project management. The major risk facing the Project is political. Restructuring the sector and
delegating the bulk of EDL's operations to the private sector is key to achieving the anticipated benefits
earlier than under the status quo. Recruitment of private operators could be delayed or hindered because
of political constraints and/or public opposition. Care is being taken to prepare comprehensive, high-
quality bidding documents and to ensure that the process is conducted objectively and transparently. The
inevitable reductions in EDL's staff will have to be handled with due sensitivity, fully taking into
consideration retraining, separation benefits, pension rights, etc. The bulk of the work force affected by
the transfer to the private sector (EDL distribution and commercial functions) would likely be retained
by the new operators. In assessing the preceding risks, it is important to note that it is fully feasible to
continue EDL operations relying only on internal reforms rather than under the unbundled structure
proposed under the Project. Under a no-restructuring scenario, significant delays would occur in the

commercialization of EDL. However, benefits from improved power supplies would not be lost to the
larger economy. A qualitative analysis was conducted by consultants comparing the relative impacts of
various institutional arrangements - including the option of limiting restructuring to an essential set of
internal reforms within the existing structure. Results of this analysis (Annex 5.2) showed that while the
status quo structure is viable, it ranks lowest of the sector structural models examined. Thus, the reforms
under the proposed project can be categorized as "no regrets" policy reform - meaning that even if it
turns out that no substantive reforms are implemented, the Project would still result in positive economic
gain, i.e., NPV > 0. This is an innovative project in the Lebanese context and the reform process may
prove to be slower to implement than currently estimated. Until now, the focus of GOL has been on
physical reconstruction. While there is no substantive difference of opinion on the nature of the needed
reforms, political constraints may slow down the process and hence a longer time period may prove to be
necessary to put them in place. GOL will need to make a special effort to convince the public, in light of
the risk that the unbundling of the sector will be perceived as responsible for the large tariff increases,
that these increases would be required even if the status quo were to be maintained.
Project Sustainability
5.20   Assuming continued political stability, project sustainability is dependent on: (a) implementation
of structural reforms; (b) introduction of an unambiguous legal framework; (c) clear definition of an
impartial and competitive regulatory structure; and (d) a political decision to carry out the reforms.
GOL's commitment to implement the preceding institutional and policy reforms is demonstrated by the
LSDP Action Program, key steps of which have already been implemented (para 1.10). This policy
framework provides for use of operational contracting (affermage) for electricity generation and
distribution. The incentive structure and regulatory framework to be made part of the affermage
contracts would be designed to further assure the Project's sustainability and efficient management of
sector assets by providing the private operators with full operational responsibility.  The private
operators would bear normal commercial risks associated with electric utility operations, and would be
required to provide all, or part of, the working capital requirements. In the near to intermediate term
EDL/GOL would continue to provide capital needs for long gestation and long-lived system facility
additions. Given the non-blueprint nature of the proposed operation, close project supervision (three
missions per year in years one and two) and a full mid-term review of implementation would be carried
out under the proposed Project.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1    During negotiations, the following agreements and assurances were obtained:

4.6);
(vi)   Not later than January 1, 1998, a tariff study will be undertaken in order to
introduce a tariff structure by March 1, 1999, that will reflect the actual cost of
supply to different consumer groups, provide for a life-line rate for low income
consumers, and encourage energy conservation (para. 4.7);
(vii)   Effective January 1, 1999, EDL will not incur any new long-term debt unless a
reasonable forecast of its debt service coverage ratio, including the debt
proposed to be incurred, indicates that said ratio will not be less than 1.5 times
(para. 4.8); and
(viii)  EDL will submit not later than October 31 of each year its investment program
for the following year to the Bank, together with a financing plan indicating how
the investment program would be financed (para. 4.8).
6.2    A special condition of loan effectiveness would be the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement
between GOL and EDL satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.4).
Recommendation
6.3    On the basis of the project justification and the above agreements, the proposed Project is
suitable for a Bank loan to the Lebanese Republic in the amount of US$65 million at the Bank's standard
LIBOR-based interest rate for US$-denominated single currency loans, repayable as a bullet on
September 15, 2006, and the partial credit guarantee of up to US$100 million. Upon satisfactory
completion of the guarantee documentation, the Board will be informed of the terms and conditions of
the guarantee prior to the launching of the bond issue.

LEBANESE REPUBLIC
SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR'
Background
1.    The Lebanese electric power supply system suffered considerable damage during the
war. As a result, supply to consumers from the public system was severely restricted. The
emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation undertaken during 1992-95 as part of National
Emergency Recovery Program (NERP) has enabled the restoration of nearly 24-hour public
power supply to most of Lebanon. By end-1996, unconstrained supply will be restored to the
remaining areas where power is still rationed. The restoration of supply has been achieved with
significant assistance from the donor community towards the estimated US$1.539 billion cost of
reconstructing the war-damage installations and new equipment. However, the actual cost is far
greater. The pressing need to address the shortage of power took precedence over the sector's
financial and institutional rehabilitation. Thus, the Government has had to bear the losses of the
state enterprise Electricite du Liban (EDL), which have amounted to nearly US$500 million over
the 1992-95 period, even though the Government is aware that such losses are unsustainable
because of the fiscal pressures they result in.
2.    A recent diagnostic study of the sector carried out by international consultants has
enabled the Government to examine various solutions to the numerous problems confronting this
key sector of the Lebanese economy. These problems include a legal framework that is no
longer suited to present circumstances, a severely weakened public utility, EDL, that suffers,
inter alia, from a lack of management autonomy, acute skill shortages, and weak financial and
commercial practices. At the same time, EDL is facing a major challenge in modernizing all
aspects of its operations and in carrying out an ambitious program of investments in new
capacity.
3.    This letter lays out the objectives and content of a far-reaching reform program for the
electricity sector that the Government intends to implement. The Government seeks the support
of the World Bank and other financiers in carrying out the reforms and their financial
participation in the 1996-2000 power system expansion program that is designed to meet the
needs of a growing economy.
Overall Objectives
4.    The provision of reliable electricity supply throughout Lebanon at minimum cost, while
taking environmental concerns into account, is a major sectoral goal. The Government is
committed to improving the management, efficiency and performance of the electricity sector,
while improving the quality of service to consumers. The sector is to become financially self-
supporting, starting with achieving solvency by 2000, i.e., meeting operating cost and debt
This is a copy of the Statement of Sectoral Policy, as approved by the Council of Ministers of the
Lebanese Republic, under Resolution # 3746, September 26,1996.



Annex 1.3

service. The Government is convinced that the objectives for the sector will be best achieved
with the active participation of the private sector in electricity generation and distribution.
Investment Strategy
5.    The investment requirements of the power sector are very large, due to insufficient
investment (and adequate maintenance) during the 1975-1990 period. Existing power plants are
nearing the end of their operational lives and will all have to be replaced by the end of the next
decade. Meeting demand for electricity, which is expected to grow at a minimum of 5 percent
p.a. for the rest of the decade, which will bring the required financing to about US$2.2 billion
(including contingencies and interest during construction) during the period 1995-2002.
6.    A significantly higher rate of 8 percent growth in electricity demand cannot be ruled out,
particularly as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also projected to grow at 7 to 8 percent. The
difficulty of forecasting demand growth after years of constrained supply requires flexibility and
modular approaches to system expansion, and the sectoral investment program will need to be
reviewed annually, which we plan to do with the Bank.  Investment options for later years
require further analysis and the necessary studies will be done to confirm that they are the least-
cost options. The Government will ensure that future investment decisions will be based upon
economic principles of optimization of capital, fuel and operating costs.
7.     The large investment program will have a major impact on both sector and public
finances, particularly during the next five years. It is necessary that consumers contribute
gradually to the costs of doubling the system capacity. The Government, therefore, intends to
require EDL to set its tariffs at levels sufficient to achieve the coverage of operating costs and
debt service by 2000, and subsequently ensure a reasonable participation by electricity
consumers in financing sectoral investments. For the medium- to long-term, the Government's
objective is to reduce the share of public investment in electric power, by inviting the private
sector to participate in any future power generation.
Environnental issues
8.    EDL is committed to minimize and eliminating negative environmental impacts
associated with the provision of electrical services to its customers. In the sector's expansion,
we will adopt environmentally-friendly technologies for power generation and help to increase
amenities through careful design of transmission and distribution systems. For this purpose, an
environmental management plan is being adopted, based on the environmental assessment for
the implementation of the new power plants at Beddawi and Zahrani, which are under
construction, and for the transmission system.
9.    EDL will also reduce overall emissions to ensure adequate ambient air quality and
reduce hazards to health. For this purpose, the Government recently instructed EDL to only use
a higher quality low-sulfur (1 percent) fuel, in all its plants operating within urban areas. The
Government is also considering the installation of emissions-control devices and treatment units
in Zouk, Jieh and Hraiche power stations.



Annex 13

Institutional Reforms
(a) Short-Term Measures
10.   Under the NERP, the rehabilitation of EDL's existing plant, as well as major investments
in new power facilities, have been undertaken through the Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR). It is the intention of the Government to transfer the assets and liabilities
relating to these investments by CDR to EDL. This transfer will be completed by 1997 onwards.
Interim operational contracting arrangements within the current legal framework - using possibly
medium term "affermage" or operational contracting arrangements - will be considered for such
facilities, including the new combined cycle plants of Beddawi and Zahrani. In addition, the
Government intends to contract out the management of the existing Zouk and Jieh power plants
as well as the two new gas turbine plants at Baalbeck and Tyre. Such interim arrangements
would be to allow time for development and presentation to Parliament of enabling legislation
that would be needed for EDL itself to be the contracting party. Finally, the Government intends
to delegate electricity distribution operations to several private operators.
11.   Since the assets and liabilities were taken over from the defunct Kadisha Company, Ltd.
in 1985, the legal status of the Kadisha concession remains unsolved. Since then, EDL has
borrowed on behalf of the Kadisha concession, and in 1995 acquired most of the outstanding
common stock of the Kadisha Company Ltd. The Government has decided to restore the
concession by the end of 1996.
12.   The Government is committed to a transparent selection process via competitive bidding
to choose qualified private operators to run generation plants and distribute power to final
consumers. Consultants are already preparing the prequalification and bidding documents to
enable the process to be launched in accordance with the schedule shown in table 1 (attached). It
is expected that about 9-12 months would be required to complete the process up to contract
signature for the new generation plants. Contracting out the distribution functions would require
a further six months, due in part to the need for use of a two-stage bidding process, with
technical proposals followed by financial proposals.
The selection process would consist of the following steps:
*   Amendment of 1964 Electricity Law to authorize EDL to seek private firms to
operate generation and distribution sector assets;
*   Public information campaign in Lebanon;
*   Announcement in the international press to seek proposals;
*   Prequalification;
*   Release of bidding documents;
*   Bid evaluation; and
*   Contract negotiations.
(b) Medium-Term Measures
13.   The Government intends to present to Parliament a comprehensive new Electricity Law
not later than January 1998 which would provide for a competitive power market through the
separation of electricity generation, transmission and distribution functions. The private sector is



Annex 1.3
Page 4 of 11
to be invited to participate in electricity generation and distribution throughout Lebanon. An
independent regulatory body will be set up under that Law to, issue licenses, oversee
relationships between sector operators, formulate electrical pricing arrangements, and to protect
consumers.
14.   As a further step towards greater private sector participation in electricity supply, once
appropriate legislation is enacted, and the initial experience with contracting out ("affermage"
arrangements) of generation and distribution is operational, the Government intends to authorize
the setting up of independent power producers.
Restructuring of EDL
15.   In the above planned scenario, EDL would remain as a public corporation owning all
sectoral assets, managing the HV transmission system, trading in bulk power and planning sector
development. However, as a first step towards greater efficiency in its operations, a proposed
law would: (i) allow the company to operate along commercial basis and thus grant more
flexibility to EDL's management; and (ii) allow for the sub-contracting of services in generation
and distribution ("affermages") for periods beyond five years. This law would also enforce the
powers of electricity distributors in dealing with illegal connections. Given the urgency in
initiating the restructuring of EDL, the Government intends to submit draft legislation to that
effect to Parliament by January 1998. In the interim, the introduction of the private sector will
take place in the context of existing legal arrangements, including the issue of decrees as may be
permitted under existing law.
Reinforcement of EDL
16.   The restructuring of EDL as a consequence of the decision to subcontract many of its
existing functions to the private sector will take some time. Nevertheless, given the fact that
EDL is in the midst of implementing a large investment program, some immediate measures are
required, particularly in the areas of commercial operations, finance, project management, and
planning.  EDL management is aware of the skill constraints facing the company and
staffing/strengthening plans have been prepared for three departments of EDL.   A
comprehensive business plan has also been prepared. It spells out the corporate objectives of the
restructured EDL and lays out the measures which have to be taken to attain these, with
particular emphasis on financial rehabilitation and manpower issues. The business plan also
incorporates a set of monitorable indicators to facilitate supervision of EDL's performance.
17.   EDL's financial management is being reinforced through the use of external consultants
in line positions for an interim period of three years during which time EDL will recruit and train
permanent qualified staff to replace them. Technical assistance and training is also being sought
to set up financial reporting, budgeting and accounting systems to bring EDL to international
utility accounting and financial reporting standards. Given the key role that EDL will play at the
center of the reconfigured power sector, technical assistance and training is crucial for EDL's
planning department in the areas of forecasting and system planning.



Annex 1.3
Page 5 of 11
Financial Aspects
18.   In order to achieve the medium-term objective of a self-supporting sector in financial
terms, EDL has to operate on a commercial basis and be able to generate an adequate cash flow
to first achieve solvency and then to contribute to the financing of the sectoral investment
program. The Government confirms that it intends to cease subsidies to the sector as soon as
feasible, but in any event not later than the year ending December 31, 1999. However, the
Government would, as needed, provide EDL with capital grants in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to cover
unexpected shortfalls in revenues, and to cover remaining investment financing requirements.
Short-term Measures and Actions Already Taken
19.   The Government has already taken a number of steps to remedy the difficult financial
condition of EDL. A decision of an increase of an average of 20 % was taken by EDL and
approved by the Government in March 1996. A three-part tariff has been introduced for
medium- and high-voltage customers to promote demand side management and thereby avoid
the investment costs of additional generation capacity. Within EDL, programs are underway to:
(i) systematically record and correctly bill medium- and high-voltage customers; (ii) modernize
the billing and collection system in two suburbs of Beirut involving some 140,000 customers. In
addition, since January 1996, the meter reading and revenue collection for about 200,000
customers outside Beirut has been contracted out to 18 private agencies. The initial results have
been successful as average monthly receipts have risen from LL 3368 million in the last quarter
of 1995 to LL 5187 million in the first quarter of 1996.
20.   EDL is committed to raising its monthly revenue collections to LL 40 billion by end-
1996. In parallel, the Government expects that EDL will bring its total energy losses down to 45
percent by end- 1996. These measures will help to significantly improve the liquidity of EDL.
As a result, the Government is expecting EDL to finance LL 80 billion (nearly 30 percent) of the
total 1996 fuel bill from its own resources, and reduce its reliance on the budget for fuel.
21.   Given the LL 600 billion (US$450 million) short-term debt of EDL to the Government
on account of fuel, and the burden this would represent if it were to be refinanced under long-
term arrangements, it has been decided to convert this debt into equity. Legislation to this effect
has been submitted to Parliament in May 1996.
22.   EDL will be authorized to write-off unrecoverable consumer arrears based on the
December 1996 accounts. During 1996, the Government intends to resolve outstanding cross-
debts in the sector through a settlement of EDL's claims against the Government agencies
(primarily for electricity bills), and a parallel settlement of the Government claims against EDL
(including for taxes). With effect from the 1997 financial year, the Government would make
adequate provisions in its budget for the electricity consumption of state bodies and will set up a
regular payments mechanism.
23.   Given the high reliance on imported petroleum for power generation, the Government
intends to introduce a revision formula which will include among other variables a fuel
adjustment clause from January 1998 to permit tariffs to be revised on a quarterly basis in line
with changes in imported oil prices. Finally, the Government will authorize EDL to adjust its



Annex 1.3
Page 6 of 11
tariffs as needed as of October 1997, in order to progressively eliminate all Government
subsidies to the sector.
Medium-Term Measures
24.   The Government intends to ensure that retail tariffs are set in relation to marginal costs
of electrical supply and cover all sectoral operating costs, debt service and to enable EDL to self-
finance a reasonable proportion of the sectoral investment program from 2000 onwards.
25.   A comprehensive tariff study would be undertaken in 1998, once consumption patterns
have stabilized following the restoration of unconstrained 24-hour power supply and the
optimization plan had been completed. The structure of retail electricity tariffs would be
reviewed so that it better reflects marginal supply costs and gives greater incentives to
consumers for energy conservation.
Conclusion
26.   The above describes the extent of the Government's commitment to a set of crucial
reforms in the electricity sector. The reform process is just beginning and will take several years
to be fully completed. The Govermment wishes to benefit from both the financial support as well
as the wide experience of the Bank in its endeavor.

LEBANESE REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
Technical Aspects of the Transmission Project
Background
1.    During the war there was considerable damage to the power facilities through
destruction and lack of maintenance. Many of the generating facilities are now obsolete.
Through the National Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP) about US$295 million has
been allocated to cover the most urgent rehabilitation works for generation, transmission and
distribution facilities. Works to be included in the NERP were selected to restore pre-war
nominal capacity through repair and retrofitting, but not to provide new capacity. Priorities and
criteria for the selection of work components included: (I) restoring communication links with
the dispatching center; (2) increasing the capacity and availability of the existing generating
stations; (3) reconstructing the damaged transmission and distribution facilities; (4) restoring
public safety; and (5) protecting existing equipment from further damage. As these works are
being completed utility service is improving significantly and is approaching 24-hour service
throughout Lebanon.'
2.     However, the restored thermal generation capacity of about 1,200 MW  still is not
sufficient to meet the expected load and extensive rationing would still be needed at peak load if
the planned interconnection with Syria had not taken place. The recent interconnection of the
Syrian and Lebanese power systems at Deir Nbouh (Nord) has been reestablished and up to 120
MVA can be imported, providing additional relief at peak load.
3.    In order to alleviate these deficiencies and to provide the required level of reliable power
for the projected load growth, the decision was made to add two 450 MW combined-cycle plants
each at Beddawi (IPC) in the north and at Zaharani in the south. In addition to the above, two 70
MW gas turbine generating plants are being installed to back-up regional load centers, one at
Tyre in the south and the other at Baalbeck in the Bekaa Valley, and are scheduled to be in
service by mid-1996. This will bring the total new installed capacity to 1,040 MW.
4.     Electricite de France (EdF), acting as consultants to Electricite du Liban (EDL), carried
out transmission planning studies in 1993-94 based on three scenarios: 1,300 MW, 1,500 MW
and 2,500 MW. The study considered a number of transmission system reinforcements for
effecting the power transfer from the new generating sites to the distribution network. EdF
recommended as least-cost the implementation of a new transmission system at 220-kV with
appropriate interconnections to the existing underlying lower voltage networks to be capable of
meeting an initial demand of 1,500 MW at the 220-kV level.
At time of writing two main transmission substations were severely damaged due to military actions,
and service availability deteriorated to four hours/day over the entire national territory.



Annex 3.1

Detailed Project Description
5.    To supply the 1,500 MW demand scenario a new 220-kV transmission network will be
implemented, consisting of a main North-South artery tying the sites of Zaharani to the South
and IPC to the North with Beirut in the center and further 220-kV interconnections to the south,
including the connection of Sour and Saida from Zaharani thus reinforcing the 66-kV
transmission in this area. To increase the supply security, a loop of 220-kV will be installed
around Beirut, connecting Mkalles, Achrafieh , commercial, ras Beyrouth, Pins and Aramoun by
underground cable and Mkalles to Aramoun by 220-kV overhead transmission lines. To the
north, the new generation will be connected to the 220-kV system at IPC which will be further
connected to Bsalim (via Halate and in the future via Kousba) and to Nord. The connection from
IPC to Bahsas will be by two 220-kV underground cable circuits. There is an existing double
circuit 220-kV transmission line between IPC and Nord. To insure a power supply with a good
voltage profile for the Bekaa Valley area to the East a 220/66-kV substation at Ksara will be
installed which will be connected to Nord via Baalbeck and Aramoun by 220-kV transmission
lines. To further increase the transmission system security, three 220/150-kV interconnections
will be implemented, one in Deir Nbouh, one at Bsalim and the other at Aramoun and in
addition, power will be fed to the 66-kV network by four new 220/66-kV substations at IPC,
Halate, Sour, Ksara and Zaharani and directly to the distribution system by 11 new 220-kV/MV
substations at Baalbeck, Ras Beyrouth, Aramoun, Commercial, IPC, Ksara, Halate, Mkalles,
Pins, Saida and Sour in the first stage and Kousba, Bahsas, Achrafieh in the second stage.
6.     The 1,500 MW system configuration chosen in the study was modified by EDL due to
some physical and financial constraints. Physical modifications included: (1) the inclusion of the
second circuit on the transmission lines through the Bekaa Valley while initially operating it at
66-kV, thus allowing the upgrading of the existing 66-kV lines in this area while maintaining the
66-kV supply. When the 66-kV lines are upgraded the second circuit through the Bekaa Valley
will operate at 220-kV; (2) the installation of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) substations in urban
areas due to the high cost of land and to construct substations that are aesthetically consistent
with the urban neighborhoods; and (3) the installation of underground 220-kV cables from IPC
to Bahsas due to urban congestion which precludes the installation of 220-kV overhead
transmission lines in this location. The financial restraints were essentially the deferral of capital
expenditures for underground cables and transformers. This deferral will result in the single
contingency requirement not being met until the cables and transformers are installed.  On a
short-term basis, the deferrals are acceptable, but as the financial condition of EDL improves, the
additional underground cables and transformers should be installed in order to meet the single
contingency system criteria.
7.    The chosen system  configuration resulted in a project with the following main
components (IBRD Map No. 26093):
(a)    339 km of 220-kV double circuit transmission lines (with fibre optic cables for
communication purposes) interconnecting the North (IPC) with the South (Sour)
2   The single contingency criteria requires the transmission system design and configuration to be of a
standard adequate to reliably meet peak load demand, even under the outage of any single element in
the system.

through Beirut (in the Center) and Deir Nbouh (Nord), Baalbeck and Ksara to
the East. The short (approximately 20 km) length of transmission line between
Sofar and Ksara is not included in this project as it is presently being constructed
with financing by EDL;
(b)    12 km of double circuit 220-kV underground cable (with fibre optic cables for
communication purposes) between IPC and Bahsas;
(c)    a new 220-kV loop around Beirut, utilizing 37 km of 220-kV underground cable
(with fibre optic cables for communication purposes); and
(d)    an interconnection of the new 220-kV network with the underlying lower voltage
network by adding 220/150-kV substations at Aramoun and Bsalim and Deir
Nbouh, 220/66-kV substations at IPC, Zahrani, Halat, Sour and Ksara and 220-
kV/MV substations at Baalbeck, Aramoun, Ras Beyrouth, Pins, Ksara, Mkalles,
Saida, Halate and Sour. The substations at Aramoun commerciale, Pins, Ras
Beyrouth, Mkalles, Bsalim are of the metal enclosed SF6 insulated type (GIS);
Ksara, Sour, Halate and Baalbeck are of the conventional outdoor type. SaYda
will be GIS type or outdoor type (the decision is under study). Later in a second
stage three other substations will be implemented Kousba (outdoor type) and and
Bahsas and Achrafieh (GIS type). These substations will be completed under
the transmission expansion program. The substations at Zaharani and IPC are
of the GIS type and are included in the power plant contracts presently under
construction.
Technical Assistance - Project Management Services
8.    The Project contains a total of eight contract packages: three overhead transmission
lines; two underground cables; and, four substations all eight which will be constructed
concurrently. It is, therefore, imperative that a strong and proactive project management team
be assembled by EDL and that the Project Manager be given the appropriate responsibility to
allow necessary implementation tasks be carried out in such a manner so as to ensure that the
projects are completed to the extent possible without delays and cost overruns.
9.    At the present time EDL is not equipped to undertake these project management tasks on
its own.  EDL recognizes this deficiency and is presently hiring additional engineering staff.
However this staff will be untrained and, with the project start imminent, will initially be ill-
equipped to undertake the project management of a project of this size and complexity.
Therefore, a consultant will also be required to provide assistance in the form of supplying
qualified project management personnel and tools for the successful implementation of the
project.  In addition the consultant will provide detailed training for the EDL Project
Management Team staff during the implementation of the project. This Technical Assistance is
anticipated to be in the form of a single contract let to a consulting firm with proven experience
on similar projects and circumstances. An outline Terms of Reference for Project Management
and a breakdown of the estimated US$6 million cost for Technical Assistance is attached in
Annex 3.5.

Project Cost Estimates
10.   Table I in Annex 3.2 gives details of the cost estimate for the project.
Project Implementation and Schedule
11.   EDL, under the auspices of the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR),
will be responsible for the implementation of the transmission expansion program. The CDR
will act as Project Procurement Agent on behalf of E]DL. The detailed engineering of the
selected transmission system for expansion has been completed and the technical specifications
were prepared by EdF.
12.   For bidding purposes the project was divided into three major components: Transmission
Lines, Underground Cables and Substations. To facilitate financing and encourage competition
the bid documents were divided in lots and prepar-d, based on supply-erect-commission
contracts with three lots for the transmission lines, two lots for the underground cables and four
lots for the substations, as follows:
Transmission lines:
Lot A:  Zaharani-Aramoun, Sour-Zaharani, Aramoun-Bsalim and Aramoun. Total length of
112 km. Financing by commercial credit.
Lot B:  Bsalim - Bahsas. Total length of 73 km. Financing by commercial credit.
Lot C:  D'Nbough (Nord)-Ksara.  Total length of 152 km.  Financing by the Islamic
Development Bank.
Underground Cables:
Lot 1:   Beirut area. Aramoun-Pins, Pins-Ras Beyrouth, Ras Beyrouth-Commercial, Pins-
Commercial and Commercial-Mkalles. Total length of 37.5 km.   Financing by
buyers' credit the European Investment Bank.
Lot 2:   Tripoli area. IPC-Bahsas. Total length of 2 x 12 = 24 km. Financing (in part) by the
World Bank.
Substations:
Lot 1:   GIS substations at Aramoun, Pins, Ras Beyrouth and Mkalles. Financing by buyer
credit.
Lot 2:   Conventional outdoor substations at Ksara, Sour and Halate. Financing by buyer
credit.
Lot 3:   GIS substations at Baalbeck Saida and Bsalim.  Financing (in part) by the World
Bank.
Commerciale financed by Solidere & G.O.L. Bids for the above have been received and were
evaluated by EDL in February 1996 and recommendations have been made to CDR for contract

award. Later three other substations will be implemented: Achrafieh (GIS type) and Bahsas
(GIS type) and Kousba (outdoor type).
13.   Subsequent to the receipt of the bids the Bank noted, (based on a review of the tender
documents and site visits), that the selection of GIS for the substation at Baalbeck and Saida did
not appear to meet the least-cost criterion. Although the choice of GIS for the other sites is
justifiable from an economic and environmental viewpoint, there appeared to be neither
economic nor environmental justification for the use of GIS at Baalbeck nor at Saida3 EDL
agreed, noting that when the documents were issued for tender the intent was to locate the
Baalbeck substation within the urban milieu and adjacent to an important Roman archeological
site. The site was then relocated to its present location outside Baalbeck and therefore a
conventional outdoor station is appropriate. Saida substation is under reconsideration  To be
eligible for World Bank financing two options appear possible under these circumstances; to
rebid this package (Lot No. 3) or negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder. The final decision
is pending.
14.   A Project Implementation Schedule is given in Annex 3.4. This schedule is based on
the contractors' schedules presented with the bids and EDL awarding the contracts by April 1,
1996.  With the combined cycle generating plants at Zaharani and Beddawi (IPC) being
scheduled for-completion on December 31, 1997, not all of the transmission expansion project
will be completed in time. However a close examination of the project schedule indicates that
Beirut will be able to receive power when the combine cycle plants come on stream.  The
transmission line from Zahrani to Aramoun is scheduled to be completed by June 1998, from
Deir Nbouh to Ksara April 1998, from Zahrani to Sour November 1998 as will the underground
cables from Aramoun to Pins to Bas Beyrouth with the substations at Aramoun, Pins and Bas
Beyrouth on june 1998. At the same time the underground cables Pins-Commercial and Ras
Beyrouth-Commercial and the substations at Ksara, Sour, Bsalim and Saida will be completed.
The remainder of the project will be completed by November 1998.
Procurement
15.   To meet the emergency construction schedule - in particular to assure that the
transmission system is operational in time to evacuate power from the new generation stations -
advance procurement actions and advance contracting are being followed. This is acceptable in
the circumstances given the emergency recovery aspect of the project. Retroactive financing by
the Bank will be required. Approximately 10 percent of the proceeds of the Bank loan would be
applied in this way - subject to the applicable Bank policy guidelines.
16.   The procurement strategy has been to break down the project to a number of packages
reflecting the technical specialty of the works and the ability to arrange financing.  This has
encouraged the widest possible participation of bidders, thus allowing for strong competition. A
series of supply-construct-commission contracts, procured under international bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank have been tendered and evaluated, but not yet awarded.
17.   Because of incompatible procedures called for by the different financing agencies and
the Borrower, it has been decided to use parallel financing of individual procurement packages.
3   At a new greenfield-bulk supply delivery point which could be established in a near-by open field.

Under this packaging plan the Bank would finance a portion or all of the costs of the three
substations at Bsalim, Saida and Baalbeck (H-V Substations, Lot No. 3) and the 220-kV
underground cables from IPC to Bahsas (HV Underground Cables, Lot No. 2).
Project Management and Monitoring
18.    For the transmission expansion project, a project management team (PMT) will need to
be put into place by EDL immediately after the first contract is signed. The PMT's task will be
two-fold. Not only will it be required to undertake the usual project management functions of
monitoring quality assurance, project schedules and costs, and approving payments to the
contractors, but it will also be required to coordinate, all at the same time, the activities of eight
separate but inter-related contracts.  For the effective management of the eight contracts it is
anticipated that at least three project implementation teams must be set up, one for each main
discipline (transmission lines, substations and underground cables) with each team having its
own project engineer reporting to the project manager for overall coordination. To be effective
the PMT will need to be able to exercise control over the project on a "stand-alone" basis with a
minimum of interference from outside parties.
19.    The duties of the project management team for this project will include: (I) reviewing
and approval of contractors' work plans, programs and designs; (2) monitoring and controlling
the contractors' progress during design, manufacture, and delivery of plant, equipment and
materials; (3) reviewing the contractors' quality assurance documentation and procedures,
including inspection and testing schedules and the results of works tests; (4) coordinating
contractor interfaces on scheduling, design compatibility and other matters that may interfere
with the timely execution of the contracts; (5) in the event of dispute, to interpret the contracts
and specifications, and as necessary advise and assist EDL management with the resolution of
any dispute or contractual claim that the contractors' may submit; (6) carrying out as and when
required factory inspections, quality assurance audits or witnessing of factory tests performed by
the contractors; (7) verifying the measurement of quantities for payment; (8) verifying and
approving contractors' applications for payments; (9) exercising cost control; (10) monitoring the
contractors' work schedules to ensure the works are proceeding according to plan; (11)
monitoring and verifying that materials, equipment and plant is delivered and installed as
specified; (12) performing acceptance tests on plant and equipment prior to take-over by EDL;
(13) producing and issuing progress reports on a monthly basis, and if necessary on a quarterly
basis; (14) reviewing "as-built" and operation and maintenance documentation as produced by
the contractors, and (15) producing final reports at the completion of each contract. Annex 3.5
contains outline terms of reference for project management services to be financed under the
project.

POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
Project Costs
1.    The Base project cost is estimated at US$411.0 million. With physical and price
contingencies the project cost is US$445.0 million, of which the foreign component is US$356.0
million. Interest during construction is estimated to be an additional US$41.0 million for an
overall total estimated cost of US$486.0 million (LL 777.5 billion). The physical contingencies
are 15 percent of the overhead transmission line base cost, 10 percent of the underground cable
base cost and 5 percent of the substation and technical assistance base costs. Base costs are at
January 1996 price levels and are derived from contract award prices for the transmission lines,
underground cables and substations and, an estimate for technical assistance. Non-bank financed
contracts do not provide for price escalation. The purchase of land and easements for substation
sites and transmission line and underground cable rights-of-way is not included.
Table 1, Project Costs by Component, summarizes the cost estimate for the project:

LEBANESE REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
HV Transmission Network Expansion Project
Outline of Terms of Reference for Project Management Team
Background
1.    Under the terms of the Transmission Expansion Project, Electricite du Liban (EDL) will
be installing 339 km of overhead double circuit 220-kV transmission lines, 37 km of single
circuit underground 220-kV cables in Beirut and 12 km of double circuit underground cable at
Tripoli and, ten substations, seven of which are gas insulated substations (GIS) with the
remaining three being conventional outdoor stations. This work covers the full territory of
Lebanon, from Sour in the south to IPC in the north, through the Bekaa Valley to the east. It is
scheduled for completion in 1998.
2.    To facilitate the implemenitation of the Transmission Expansion Project, EDL seeks the
services of a single project management team to assist in overseeing the works.
3.    The objective of the project management team will be to monitor the contractors'
activities in the fields of quality assurance, work progress and payments and to coordinate the
activities of eight separate contracts, all to ensure the works are completed within the scheduled
times and at contracted costs.
4.    To assist in this task, EDL plans to engage the services of a reputable project
management consulting firm with proven experience on similar projects. The consulting firm
would be selected in accordance with the World Bank's guidelines for the recruitment of
consultants.
5.    For the transmission expansion project, the project management team will need to be put
into place immediately after the first contract is signed.
Scope of Work
6.    The project management team's task will be two-fold: (a) undertake the necessary
project management functions of monitoring quality assurance, project schedules and costs, and
approving payments to the contractors; and (b) coordinate the activities of eight separate but
inter-related contracts being carried out across Lebanon at the same time.
The duties of the project management team for this project will be as follows:
*   Review and approve the contractors' work plans, programs and designs;
*   Monitor and control the contractors' progress during design, manufacture, and
delivery of plant, equipment and materials;



Annex 3.5
Page 2 of5
*   Review the contractors' quality assurance documentation and procedures, including
inspection and testing schedules and the results of works tests;
*   Coordinate individual contractor interfaces on scheduling, design compatibility and
other matters that may interfere with the timely execution of the contracts;
*   In the event of dispute, interpret the contracts and specifications, and as necessary
advise and assist EDL with the resolution of any dispute or contractual claim that
the contractors may submit;
*   Carry out as and when required factory inspections, quality assurance audits or
witnessing of factory tests performed by the contractors;
*   Verify the measurement of installed quantities for payment;
*   Verify and approve the contractors' applications for payments;
e   Exercise cost control;
-   Monitor the contractors' work schedules to ensure the works are proceeding
according to plan;
*   Monitor and verify that materials, equipment and plant is delivered and installed as
specified;
*   Perform acceptance tests on plant and equipment prior to take-over by EDL;
*   Produce and issue progress reports on a monthly basis, and if necessary on a
quarterly basis, using a common format acceptable to EDL;
*   Review "as-built" and operation and maintenance documentation as produced by
the contractors; and
*   Produce final reports at the completion of each contract.
7.     For the effective management of these eight contracts, at least three project
implementation teams will be set up, one for each main discipline (transmission lines,
substations and underground cables) with each team having its own project engineer reporting to
the project manager for overall coordination. A typical organization chart reflecting the type of
project management organization envisaged is attached.
Staffing and Duties of the Consultant
8.     The Consultant will be expected to provide the following personnel to fulfill the tasks
described as follows:
9.     ProjectManagerAdvisor. The Project Manager will have the ultimate responsibility for
the project management team. The Advisor will be a senior person with proven project
management and administrative skills and experience in similar projects. He will help the

15.   Site Engineer Advisors. The Site Engineer Advisors will be responsible for the training
and assisting in the monitoring and verification of contractor field activities to the specified
norms and for confirming measurements and quantities for payment. Three civil engineer
Advisors are envisaged, one for the transmission lines, one for the underground cables and one
for the substation civil works. A geotechnical engineering advisor is envisaged and he will aid
and assist in the witnessing and monitoring and the agreeing with any specified contractor
foundation tests and advising on geotechnical problems throughout the project. One electrical
engineer Advisor is required to aid in the monitoring and verification of electrical equipment and
one commissioning engineer Advisor is envisaged as being required during the commissioning
of the substations. All these Advisor engineers will oversee and train a group of EDL field
engineers who, in turn, would undertake the day-to-day inspection, monitoring and verification
activities.
Training of EDL Staff
16.   EDL considers it to be of utmost importance that its staff receive a thorough and
competent training in all aspects of project management activities. The consultant will be
required to provide on-the-job training of EDL staff in the skills of project administration,
contract  monitoring   and   control,  quality  assurance  of  material  supply  and
installation/construction to the specified standards and, technical and contractual interpretations
of the specifications and contracts.
17.   EDL will therefore assign the Consultant to the Transmission Expansion Project
Management team whose staff members will work alongside the consultant and will receive on-
the-job training as the project continues. EDL will also provide field inspectors, field quantity
measurement personnel, and accounting, scheduling and clerical personnel to carry out those
day-to-day activities, which require full-time on-site field and office personnel, and these
personnel will be also be trained by the consultant.
18.   EDL fully expects that as the project proceeds, the EDL staff will become more and
more involved in the project and decision-making processes and by the time the Transmission
Expansion Project is completed, the EDL staff will be fully trained and participating in the all
operational and decision-making processes associated with this project.

Supervision Plan
A.    Reporting Requirements
1.    Project execution will be monitored to record progress against the implementation
schedule, identifying and agreeing with the Borrower on any corrective actions that may be
required in respect of individual components. Reporting is the responsibility of Electricite du
Liban (EDL) for the investment components and Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric Resources
(MHER) for the institutional restructuring component. Reports will be prepared quarterly and
will comprise a financial section recapitulating project expenditures, a section assessing the
progress of each of the Programmed activities by reference to the implementation schedule, and
an evaluation of progress made.
B.    Supervision Plan
2.     Careful coordination and frequent Bank supervision missions, particularly in the early
years of the Project will be required. Subsequent to the fielding of the new operational partners
for EDL, supervision frequency may be decreased to twice yearly. Expected skill requirements
would include financial, economics, engineering, institutional specialist, procurement and
training. A mission in 1998 will perform a mid-term review.

POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Plan - Summary
A.    Background
1.    The electricity  sector in Lebanon  is making pioneering efforts to  introduce
environmental management in its operations. An example is the recent decision to use only
higher quality, one-percent sulfur, fuel oil at the Zouk power station, which will contribute
significantly to reduce total S02 emissions in Lebanon. There are also plans to further control
emissions of SO2 and particulate materials through the environmental upgrading of the existing
power plants at Zouk, Jieh and Hrayche. The power sector is presently the major emitter of S02,
accounting for about 75 percent of emissions in 1993/94.
2.    As part of these efforts, an environmental assessment was carried out for the sector
expansion, including two power generation projects, and the transmission system project. This
summary will focus on the aspects related to the project proposed for World Bank financing, i.e.,
the transmission system, including the transmission line, its right-of-way, substations and access
or maintenance roads.
B.    Major Project Components
3.    The transmission system project includes 339 km of 220-kV overhead, double- and
single-circuit lines, and 49 km of 220-kV underground cables, located around Beirut and
Tripoli. It also includes ten 220-kV-150-kV substations, out of which three are extensions of
existing substations (Bsalim, Pins and Saida). Due to the limited availability of land and
potential environmental constraints, GIS substations are programmed for seven of these sites.
4.     To facilitate environmental analysis, the project is divided into four sections: (i) Section
1, located along the coastal zone, comprises the lines from Sour to Tripoli/Beddawi, crossing a
densely populated and industrialized area; (ii) Section 2, from Aramoun to Ksara, crosses the
Lebanon Mountain range; (iii) Section 3, Ksara to Hermel, follows the Bekaa valley in Eastern
Lebanon through mostly agricultural land; and (iv) Section 4, Hermel-Tripoli/Beddawi crosses
the mountain range in the North of Lebanon.

Project". Refer to Fitchner GmbH & Co., January 1996.



Annex 3.7
Page 2 of 6
C      Baseline Environmental Description
5.     The transmission lines run through five out of the six Lebanese provinces, and crosses
three major geo-morphological zones: the coastal plain and foothills, the Lebanon Mountain
range, and the Bekaa valley. The highest elevations along the route are about 1,400 -1,500 m.
Geologic problems, including soil erosion in steep slopes and earthquakes in the Bekaa valley,
are environmental factors that had to be considered in project design.
6.     The transmission lines will cross different types of land cover, as shown in Table 1.
Section 1 goes along the densely populated coastal corridor; the remaining non-built areas are
used intensively as agricultural land. Section 2 crosses the Lebanon Mountains in an area where
human settlements are rapidly being developed; passing mainly grasslands and rocky outcrops,
the transmission line also crosses agricultural land to reach Ksara. Section 3, in the Bekaa
valley, goes along flat lands, with intense agricultural activity south of Baalbeck (vineyards, fruit
orchards, irrigated areas, dry land crops), and through grasslands and steppes to the north.
Section 4 crosses a hilly region with few, small settlements and extensive woodland and forested
areas; in the western slope, there is some agricultural activity.

7.     The biotopes crossed by the transmission lines provide suitable habitats for different
groups of animals, including spiders, beetles, snakes, lizards, small sonig birds (warblers,
chaffinches, robins), and birds of prey. Bigger birds and mammals have become almost extinct in
Lebanon, and are not expected to be found in the project area.
8.      There are no currently known archeological sites along the direct route of the
transmission line. Nevertheless, the Eastern Mediterranean is rich in archeological sites, and it
may be assumed that there are still undiscovered sites in Lebanon. The transmission lines
however, are distant to the designated protected areas of Lebanon: the Cedar Forests of Ehden
and Barouk, and the Palm Islands.



Annex 3.7

D.    Potential Environmental Impacts
9.     Land acquisition and use. During the design of the project, effective measures have
been adopted to minimize interference with existing settlement and land use. This included the
avoidance of designated urban areas (in consultation with local authorities), of existing or
proposed industrial estates and regional infrastructure developments, of high value agricultural
land and of archaeological, cultural and historical sites.  The land use changes due to
implantation of the towers will affect about 3.7 ha of agricultural land, 1.2 ha of forest areas and
2.5 ha of grassland with rocky outcrops. These land losses are small in comparison with the
ongoing conversions in land use from agriculture to industrial and urban uses. In the easement
areas, most of the land will not require any changes from its present land use, due to the adopted
design heights and selective location of towers.
10.    Landscape/Visual Impacts.  The clearance height of 16m requires unusually high
towers; hence these towers will be visible from far away against the skyline, especially in
exposed hilltops and visible stands.  A design review will establish whether it is possible to
reduce the height for some route sections (e.g., crossing agricultural land).
11.    Vegetation and Wildlife.  Vegetation will be affected directly at the tower and
substation sites, but recovery after construction is possible, provided that there is erosion control.
About 59 km of forested areas will be crossed by the route; most of these forests have already
degenerated to machie or garigue with oaks, due to extensive overgrazing. In general, as the
traversed woodland is not dense, there is no need for extensive clearance. Transmission lines
may affect birds, in particular: birds of prey, ducks and sea birds (along the coast) may be killed
by colliding with the conductors. Because of the lack of resting or breeding areas along the
route, the effect of the transmission lines on migrating birds might be limited.
12.   Protected Areas. The project will not affect any of the three existing protected areas in
Lebanon.
13.   Water Resources.   The transmission line project can be implemented without
significant adverse effects on water resources. Direct impacts of the project on surface water
will be confined to an increase in the sediment runoff during the construction phase at river
crossing locations. No direct negative impacts on groundwater are expected. The availability of
electricity at rural locations through the network's extension will probably increase pumping for
irrigation, thus affecting water resources in the long term.
14.   Noise and Air Quality Transformer cooling Medium. The transmission line project
will not contribute to a significant increase on ambient noise levels and to a decrease in air
quality. The projected use of GIS substations in urban areas reduces the transformer noise. The
transformer oil cooling systems do not utilize PCBs.
15.    Electrical and Magnetic Fields. Using the worst case values, the electrical field
strength at ground level beneath the 220-kV OTL will attain a maximum of about 3-kV/m, at
mid-span between two masts. This is below the guideline value of the International Radiation
Protection Association (IRPA)/WHO, which is 5-kV/m. The corresponding magnetic flux
density arising in usual operating practice could range between 8 and 30 uT, thus below of the
IRPA/WHO guideline value of 200 uT. Based on previous investigations and epidemiological



Annex 3.7
Page 4 of 6
studies, no potential damages to human health are expected from the operation of these high
voltage transmission lines.
16.    Recreation and Tourism  Use.  No direct adverse impacts are expected on these
activities, as neither the transmission lines not the substations are located in or near established
recreation and tourism sites or related facilities. Visual impacts from the transmission line could
negatively affect landscapes of touristic interest, in special the forested gorges north of Beirut,
and other forested areas. The transmission lines would contribute positively to the tourism
industry, by reducing the frequency of interruptions of the power supply in touristic areas, such
as the coastal corridor and the archeological sites in the Bekaa.
17.    Historical and Cultural Sites. The transmission line route sections and substation sites
have been located in order to avoid built-up areas to the greatest extent possible, with particular
attention to registered historical sites. In general, the selected routes and sites are at acceptable
distances from existing or possible locations of historical, cultural and archeological sites.
Although the discovery of new significant sites during the construction phase is considered
remote, measures for the protection of the sites and relics eventually discovered are
recommended in the environmental mitigation plan.
E.    Mitigation Plan
18.    EDL will have the primary responsibility for implementing the environmental mitigation
plan, in collaboration with their contractors, and responsible sectoral and local authorities. In
order to build EDL's capacities for environmental management of its activities, including power
generation, transmission and distribution, the staff responsible for the plan's implementation will
undertake an environmental impact assessment and management course (3-4 months), early in
the construction phase. In addition, a long-term environmental management training program
will be prepared, and an environmental monitoring plan is being adopted for the new combined
cycle power plants at Beddawi and Zaharani.
19.    Design Phase.  The most critical environmental decision associated with electrical
power transmission line construction and operation is route selection. The transmission line
route has been selected taking into consideration economic and ecological aspects.  The
alternative adopted of following as much as possible the right-of-way of the existing
transmission lines, minimized the potential impacts of opening of access roads, and the socio-
economic impacts related to land acquisition. The use of GIS substations minimized the
potential noise and land use impacts in urban areas.
20.    Construction Phase.  The environmental impacts arising from the project will occur
mostly during the construction phase. Mitigation measures to be implemented by EDL, or by the
contractors under EDL supervision are tabulated below:

Transmission Expansion Project: Environmental Mitigation Measures During
Construction
Impact            [                        Mitigation Measures
Land acquisition     *   Acquire land used for towers and substations, with payment of full
and use                   compensation as defined by law.
*   Compensate for felled woodland, either by payment or by
reafforestation.
*   Compensate for damage to crops by payment.
*   Minimize interference with agricultural land:
-   lay-down areas and construction camps to be sited in non-
productive areas, in consultation with the relevant local
authorities;
-   towers and lines stringing should take place, as far as
possible, during non-harvest periods.
*   Minimize clearings, especially in forested areas.
*   Use extensively the same right-of-way wherever possible, when the
projected route runs parallel to existing transmission lines.
Landscape/           *   Minimize bulldozed tracks for access, and maximum use of main
soil erosion              roads and village tracks.
*   Return access roads to their former condition wherever possible
upon completion of construction works, especially in forest areas.
*   Grassing over of tower sites, upon completion of construction.
*   R_duce  the  ground  clearance  wherever possible  (e.g., in
agricultural land, mountain areas and other unpopulated areas).
Historical and       *   Once the surveys and demarcation for the route, tower sites and
cultural sites            easement boundaries is finalized, EDL will submit to the Ministry
of Culture and the National Museum the final survey notes, and
inform them of any points of specific interest identified on, or in
the immediate vicinity, of the planned route.
*   Surveyors and contractors must immediately cease field works and
notify EDL if any archeological, historical or cultural sites, artifacts
or relics are found during construction.
21.    Operational phase:  During the operational phase, the following mitigating measures
will be adopted as part of the maintenance and servicing work by EDL:



Annex 3.7
Page 6 of 6
*   Selective hand clearance of vegetation to maintain design clearances, with minimal
use of internationally approved chemical defoliants at substation and tower sites,
and along the route.
*   Proper handling and storage of transformer oils and consumable, taking precautions
against leaks and spillages; provision of gravel/sand containments for all
transformers at substations.
*   Complying with and maintaining safety standards at substations, including fire-
fighting equipment and procedures.
*   Periodical line testing, insulator cleaning and parts replacement maintenance.
*   Routine inspections and actions as required for erosion control at tower sites,
especially those located on steep slopes and gorges.

LEBANESE REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.    As a consequence of the war, Electricite du Liban (EDL) did not maintain up-to-date
financial records over 1985-1991. During 1995, with the help of its external auditors, Deloitte
and Touche, EDL has been reconstituting its accounts over 1992-95. The audited accounts for
these years were heavily qualified for a number of reasons, including inadequacy of recording
methods, absence of essential registers,' unreliable consumer records, and lack of sufficient
qualified personnel. Ernst & Young - France (E&Y) carried out a diagnosis of the sector and of
EDL over 1995-96, and in this context, prepared a financial model. This financial projections
herein are based in part on the above data; the assumptions reflect the best judgment of the
mission on EDL's finances, but should be considered as tentative. This is particularly the case
for the assessment of revenues, given the absence of proper customer records.
2.     The financial model, expressed in current terms, is based on the assumptions that
inflation will be 12% in 1996; 11% in 1997; 10% in 1998; 8% in 1999; and 6% over 2000-02.
The exchange rates was assumed to remain constant at LL 1600 = US$1.
Income Statements
3.     The revenues were derived from the schedule at Appendix 1. The forecast of sales was
derived from E&Y data. E&Y made a survey of the economy from which it derived the sectoral
breakdown of sales.2  EDL introduced on February 1, 1996 a three-part tariff equivalent to
US¢5-7-20/kWh for industrial consumers (High and Medium Voltage), aimed at discouraging
the use of electricity at peak hours. Effective March 1, 1997, EDL is expected to introduce an
increase of 10 LL/kWh across all consumer categories (referred to as the environmental
surcharge).3 Future tariff increases appear below the Sources and Applications of Funds
Statements.
4.     Historically, it has been estimated that EDL could only collect about 50-70% of its
billing. However, during 1996, EDL started a major effort, with the assistance of consultants, to
check and record anew all its high- and medium-voltage consumers (about 2,000 customers), and
to systematically check the records of two suburbs of Beirut (altogether 140,000 customers) and
introduce appropriate computerized records for these. With such efforts, together with the recent
subcontracting of meter reading and collection services and the planned affermages for
distribution, as well as a new incentive scheme for the concerned personnel, it is assumed by
E&Y that provisions for doubtful accounts will gradually decline in accordance with the rates
appearing below the income statements. EDL considers that these rates are conservative, and
that the loss recovery program would in reality reduce the losses still further.
I   A new assets register has been introduced in 1996.
2   Given the considerable shortfall in supply until 1995, and the widespread use of private generators, no
reliable estimate could be made of the power market.
This reflects a Government decision of January 17, 1996.



Annex 4.2

5.     The Fixed Charges correspond to monthly fees that consumers are required to pay in
connection with electricity service. They were increased from LL 1,000/kVA to LL 1,200/kVA
in March 1996 (i.e., 20%).  In October 1996, an additional rehabilitation surcharge was
introduced as follows:
Consumer Category                    Monthly Charge (LL)
Small (< 3 kVA)                      5,000
Large (> 3 kVA)                      10,000
Industrial                           200/kVA
It is expected to generate the equivalent to US$30 million on an annual basis. For subsequent
years, these were projected to increase in accordance with inflation.
6.     Sundry Revenues correspond to revenues other than those from electricity sales. These
were increased in accordance with inflation.
7.    The cost of Fuel was derived from the supply forecast at Appendix 2. The forecast of
generation by hydroelectric and thermal plants, as well as purchases/imports, was derived from
EDL and E&Y data. The heat rates reflect E&Y forecast, and were correlated with historical data
(1992-94).
8.     Power purchases were derived from the supply forecast (at Appendix 2) and the schedule
at Appendix 3. It was assumed that the tariffs charged to EDL would increase in accordance with
inflation.
9.     Salaries and Wages were derived from a detailed manpower plan prepared by E&Y.
These also reflect the cost of a compensation program now under preparation in connection with
a downsizing plan.
10.    Operation and maintenance data are not consistent in historical years. During the
forecast period, E&Y's estimate of the fixed costs of the EDL was applied.
11.   Qther expenses were increased in accordance with inflation.
12.    Depreciation was calculated in accordance with the schedule at Appendix 4. The
depreciation rates used in EDL's audited accounts are relatively high:

Depreciation Rates
Item                               Depreciation (%)
Land
Civil Engineering                         2.5%
Equipment                                 6.0%
Generators                                8.0%
Transformers                              5.0%
Cells                                     6.0%
Posts                                     6.0%
Cables                                    5.0%
Other Assets                              9.5%
With respect to the assets in service, as of December 31, 1995, these were assumed to be
depreciated at an average rate of 6%. Additions to assets in subsequent years were depreciated
in accordance with the expected lives of the assets.
13.   InersLtexpense was derived from the debt schedule at Appendix 5.
Balance Shee
14.   The December 31, 1995 Balance Sheet was revised by the auditors to reflect
restructuring measures taken during 1996 including: (i) the transfer of assets from CDR (with
corresponding indebtedness); and (ii) the conversion of arrears on account of fuel purchases and
Government advances into equity.4
15.   Cash was derived on a residual basis.
16.   Accounts receivable were derived from the days of sales equivalent which appear below
the balance sheets.
17.   Prepayments and Inventories were increased in accordance with inflation.
18.   Fixed Assets additions and Work in Progress were derived from the Investment Program
(Appendix 6) and the Commissioning schedule (Appendix 4).
19.   Other Assets include the shares of the Kadisha Company which EDL acquired during
1995, as well as the proceeds from a US$20 million loan from the Banque du Liban which was
onlent to the Kadisha Company. The projections do not provide for the sale of such shares, and
assume that the Kadisha Company would repay the loan in accordance with the amortization
schedule agreed with Banque du Liban. In addition, EDL has, for all practical purposes,
guaranteed to the State the repayment of an Austrian loan to the Kadisha company, which is
backed by a corresponding agreement with the Kadisha company (balance outstanding as of
December, 31 1995 was US$62 million). This loan has been assimilated to a contingent liability,
and thus is off balance sheet.
20.   The Overdraft was calculated on a residual basis.
The restructuring of EDL's Balance Sheet was approved by Parliament (Law 545 of August 24,
1996).



Annex 4.2

21.    Accounts payable to Suppliers were assumed to be equivalent to 3 months of salaries and
fuel expenses.
22.    Treasury Advances were assumed to remain constant.
23.    Other creditors were assumed to increase in accordance with inflation.
24.    Long-Term Debt was derived form the debt schedule (Appendix 5). One should note
that it provides for one loan (Banque du Liban) whose proceeds are onlent to the Kadisha
company. With respect to the domestic bullet loan for land acquisition, it was assumed that,
while maturing in 2000, EDL would be able to refinance it. It was also assumed that, up to 1999,
EDL would finance 100% of its investment program by long term debt (the last loan in the debt
schedule is designed to achieve this objective).
25.    Other Government Debt corresponds to borrowings made in the 1980's on EDL's behalf
by the Government. The amounts are under dispute, and it was assumed that the balance of these
loans would remain constant during the period under review.
26.    Retirement Fund provisions were increased in accordance with inflation.
27.    Capital and Reserves were assumed to remain constant.
28.    Government contributions were assumed, until 1999, to cover the operating deficits as
well as the debt service obligation of EDL so that its cash balance will remain constant until
1999. Government contributions would cease in 2000.
29.    Other contributions were assumed to remain constant, except for 1999, at which time
EDL expects to get one substation in kind, for the equivalent of US$35 million (Solidere).
Sources and Applications of Funds
30.   These were derived from the Income Statements and Balance Sheets. No historical
statements were produced, given the absence of consistent and reliable data.

POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1.    An economic evaluation of the 1995-99 time-slice of the sectoral investment program
(Annex 4.2, Appendix 6) was carried out, rather than for one single element - the expansion of
the backbone ring transmission system provided for under the project. This time-slice approach
is to deal with what would otherwise be an arbitrary allocation of specific benefits to an element
of an investment program, when the entire program itself is required to meet customer demand.
Using this approach, only investments in generation, transmission and distribution were included
in the analysis. Physical contingencies at a uniform 10 percent were added to base costs.
Provision for operating and maintenance costs were taken at 2 percent of the cumulative
investment costs. Since the new generating plants are all No. 2 fuel (diesel)-fired, incremental
fuel costs were estimated using this fuel at a price of US$170/ton (in constant terms). Average
running heat rates (fuel efficiency) of 190 gms/kWh was used for the new 450 MW combined-
cycle plants.
Demand and Energy Forecasts
2.    Two scenarios of electricity demand growth were examined. The first assumes 8 percent
annual economic growth, in line with the current Bank GDP forecast for Lebanon. The second is
more conservative, and assumes that economic growth will average 6 percent over the 1996-
2000 period. Both scenarios allow for the impact of higher real electricity prices on electricity
demand. Normally, economic growth in developing economies results in electricity demand
growth at a higher rate than the growth in GDP. However, in the case of Lebanon, given the
expected large real price increases and the scope for demand-reducing measures, electricity
demand is projected to grow over the planning period 1995-2002 only at a rate equal to the
growth in GDP.
3.    The base year for the demand forecast was taken as 1995. Estimated consumption was
reconstituted for the base year given that 24-hour continuity of supply by EDL had not yet been
restored and utility recorded data was incomplete. It was thus necessary to include an estimate
of electricity provided by private generators to arrive at an overall power market figure for total
electricity consumption in 1995. However, data on the numerous individual private generation
suppliers is scarce and unreliable. EDL's consultants (Emst & Young) attempted to quantify the
installed capacity held in private hands, either for self-use and/or for resale. E & Y estimate that
in 1995 about 600 MW of private generation capacity was used on average for near 7 hours/day,
producing 1,500 GWh.

4.    Import data on diesel was used to cross check whether the above informal generation
estimate was reasonable. Of the 1 million tons of diesel imported in 1995, the transport sector
was estimated to account for 350-400,000 tons,2 construction and heating for 100,000 tons each,
leaving the balance of 450-500,000 tons for power generation. As EDL did not use any diesel
fuel for power generation in 1995, most, if not, all of this diesel fuel would have been consumed
by private generators. By way of comparison, generating 1,500 GWh using small diesel units
would have consumed 450,000 tons of fuel, assuming an average efficiency of 300 gms/kWh.
The estimate of 1,500 GWh for informal supplies thus appears reasonable, and was added to
EDL's production of 5,422 GWh to give a total estimate of the 1995 national power market of
6,922 GWh, which served as a base for the demand projections.

Benefits
5.    The main quantifiable benefit from the investment program is the incremental energy
supplied to consumers as a result of the sector investment program. The first generation units
are due in service in 1997. Hence the incremental electricity consumption over the five years
1997-2001 was considered as the main benefit from the program. However, the prevailing
(1996) average tariff of LL 103 (6.4 US cents)/kWh, is well below full-cost recovery and does
not reflect the benefits to consumers of utility-grade electricity supply. In Lebanon, the
willingness of residential consumers to pay high rates for minimal, low-quality electricity supply
has been clearly demonstrated. The informal sector generators charge between US$30-45 per
kVA on a monthly basis for supply varying between 8 and 12 hours per day. This is equivalent
to an average of LL 200(13 US cents)/kWh. This value was used to calculate the IRR based on
the criteria of "demonstrated willingness to pay". For the purposes of calculating the program's
2   Study "Maintenance & Rehabilitation of Lebanon's Road Network" by Dar Al-Handasah, 1995, states
that there are about I million vehicles in total, of which 90 percent are passenger cars. There is a low
penetration of diesel engines in the car fleet (about 10 percent), i.e., some 50,000 diesel vehicles in
Lebanon. The same study estimates the national weighted average fuel consumption to be about
3,100 liters/year, or a total of about 390,000 tons.

minimum internal economic rate of return (IRR), a weighted average tariff of LL 116/kWh (7.2
US cents)3 was used.
6.    There will also be significant efficiency gains from the reduction in technical energy
losses expected to be achieved by the private firms who will be responsible for operations and
management of power generation and distribution. A reduction in technical losses from 15
percent today to 10 percent by 2001 is equivalent to releasing an additional 500 GWh4 from the
existing system. Equally important, the reduction in losses will free up peak generation capacity
of about 100 MW, thereby allowing US$35 million of investment in new gas turbine units to be
deferred. Reduced technical losses were valued at the weighted average tariff and included as
benefits from the investment program. Finally, savings from cutting electricity imports from
Syria, currently about 750 GWh annually, were valued at the current import price of 5 US
cents/kWh and also added to the benefits from the program.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
7.    The IRR on the investment program over its expected 25-year life (1995-2020) was
calculated using the parameters described above. Table I below presents the results of the
calculations. The Base-Case was taken as the 8 percent demand growth scenario. The Base-case
IRR with benefits valued at the willingness to pay, is estimated to be 22.4 percent. Note that this
IRR is conservative as it understates the benefits from the project. The 13 US ¢kWh rate (from
the alternative "informal" diesel-based supplies does not reflect the true value to consumers from
the reliability gains to be achieved through the project. Other non-quantified savings to
consumers results from the shuWdown of informal sector diesel generators. In the absence of the
investment program, EDL would be unable to supply all its consumers and load shedding would
be unavoidable. At the current evening peak, EDL charges its industrial consumers 20 US
cents/kWh if they do not cut their demand as it has no generation reserve margin. The cost of
unserved energy (or of alternative auto generation) is far greater than the benefits assumed here,
but were not quantified for the purposes of this IRR analysis.
3  An average of 1,500 GWh @ LL 200/kWh and 5,400 GWh @ LL 92/kWh.
4   A 5 percent saving of total generation in 2000 is equivalent to 490-550 GWh, depending on demand
growth.

Sensitivity Analysis
8.    The IRR is heavily influenced by two factors: (i) because of the need to reconstruct
infrastructure due to war damage, the heavy investment cost of new generation capacity
additions is concentrated in the first years of the period; and (ii) the inadequacy of the present
level of tariffs. The impact of valuing the benefits at the tariffs projected to be applied if the
proposed loan conditions are fulfilled would yield an IRR of 17.2 percent. The impact of a one-
year delay in completing the transmission investments to be financed by the proposed loan
would be to lower the IRR only by 0.5 percent. A ten percent cost overrun on the transmission
component would have the same relatively minor impact. One of the main areas of uncertainty,
which has considerable influence on the IRR, is the forecast rate of growth in demand. The
impact of lower electricity demand under a low GDP growth scenario was therefore examined.
Annual average load growth of 6 percent over the 1995-2000 with benefits valued at projected
tariffs, results in an IRR of 13.5 percent. This shows that even if electricity demand falls short of
the Base-case forecast, the IRR on the investment program would remain satisfactory. Table I
above shows the impact on the IRR of the most likely risks which could affect implementation of
the program. For example, valuing benefits at the willingness-to-pay, the cumulative impact of
lower (6 percent) demand, a 10 percent cost overrun as well as a one-year completion delay
would reduce the IRR to 16.2 percent. Only if electricity demand growth during 1996-2001
averages 4.5 percent or less (benefits at projected rates) does the IRR fall below ten percent. The
risk of such low demand growth is considered to be small.
