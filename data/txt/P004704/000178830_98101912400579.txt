I. TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Transport System
General
1.01      Thailand's transport system is a mix of traditional and modern
modes, principally (in order of importance) roads, the railways and inland
waterways. The highest concentration of traffic is over the main arteries
constituted by national roads, railways and river navigation. National roads
generally run in close proximity to railway lines and, in the Chao Phya
basin extending north from Bangkok, all three principal modes are represented.
Total length of the transport network is adequate for the next decade, but
its quality, in particular that of secondary and tertiary roads, needs sub-
stantial upgrading.
Roads
1.02      By traffic volume, network length and value of sunk investments,
roads are the most important transport infrastructure. National highways,
the primary road system, total nearly 13,000 km which is more than three
times the length of the railways (about 3,800 km). Like the railway lines,
they radiate from Bangkok to the national borders. More than 90% of national
roads are paved.
1.03      Provincial roads, the secondary road system connecting provincial
towns and other major population centers with national roads, total more than
22,000 km. Despite increasing traffic requirements, most provincial roads are
in very poor condition. About 60% (13,000 km) are unimproved and often not
passable in rainy weather. Of the remaining 40% (9,000 km), half are paved
and half have graveled surfaces. National highways and provincial roads
primarily serve the rural population, as do inland waterways and the railways.
The responsibility for construction and maintenance of the national and
provincial road systems is vested in the Department of Highways in the Ministry
of Communications. A program for upgrading secondary roads is underway.
1.04      Tertiary roads are defined as roads not classified as national,
provincial or urban. They include cycle tracks and, in some cases, even
footpaths. Estimates place their length at between 40,000-60,000 km, but
inventory data are incomplete and sketchy. Although a few thousand km of
these roads have been improved in recent years, maintenance has been limited.
Regional coverage of these roads is not balanced. Tertiary roads connect
villages and hamlets with the primary and secondary road systems, railways
and inland waterways. They are administered by a number of over-lapping
national, provincial and local agencies - a system which needs rationalizing.
Appropriate steps for improving tertiary roads are under study (para. 1.14).
Inland Waterways
1.05      The inland waterways system consists of the rivers and canals in
the central plains and some sections of the Mekong river. Navigable waterways
in the central plains comprise about 1,600 km in the rainy season and 1,100 km



-2-
in the dry season. During the rainy season (July to December), barges up to
80 tons and two meters draft can negotiate the waterways from the gulf of
Thailand to Uttaradit (about 700 km). In the dry season (January to June),
navigation is restricted to the section from Bangkok to Nakhon Sawan, halfway
between the capital and Uttaradit. The principal rivers in the waterways
system are the Chao Phya, which is navigable up to Nakhon Sawan; the Nan
River, linking Uttaradit to Nakhon Sawan; and the Pa Sak River between
Ayutthia (on the Chao Phya) and the Rama VI dam. Apart from a string of
landing places, built mainly for private use, no river port facilities exist.
The fleet of mostly wooden barges numbers about 7,000, of which about 50%
exceed 40 tons and 10% (steel barges) have a dead weight range of 100-300
metric tons. Most of the fleet is privately owned. Public investment
in waterways transport has been very limited in the past; a project to
improve the system is currently under preparation (para. 1.14).
Sea Ports
1.06      There are some 35 sea ports in Thailand, which can be broadly
divided into two groups according to location, size and function. The first
group includes Bangkok, Si Racha and Sattahip - all of which are within 200
km of the capital and serve as Thailand's principal external trade outlets.
Bangkok, the country's most important port, dominates international waterborne
traffic, accounting for 90% of dry cargo imports and exports except bulk
agricultural exports handled at deep water anchorage off Si Racha. Si Racha
is the port of discharge for most oil imports, and Sattahip, built as a
military facility, handles some containerized commercial cargo at present.
However, the Government has decided to develop Sattahip as a major commercial
deep sea port, and the first investments are scheduled for the early eighties.
The second group consists of the southern ports, which are scattered over
750 km of the southern peninsular coast between its northern tip and Malaysia.
These ports have primarily regional significance. About half of them
serve, exclusively as fishing ports, while the other half combine coastal
transport, imports and exports and fishery functions. Songkhla and Pattani
on the east coast of the peninsula and Phuket and Kan Tang on the west coast
are the largest of the southern ports. Only Songkhla and Pattani have the
potential for deep sea port development. Domestic transport to, from-and
within the southern peninsula is predominantly land based. Thus coastal
shipping plays a limited role in the transport sector. The extent to which
coastal ports can assume larger transport functions, is under review (para.
1.14).
Civil Aviation
1.07      Thailand's international and domestic air traffic are centered
at Don Muang airport, in the vicinity of Bangkok, which serves as a joint
civilian and military facility. The feasibility of creating a second major
airport serving the capital has been studied for more than ten years.
Outside Bangkok, there are about 40 air fields of various sizes; of these,
close to half receive scheduled flights. Domestic air transport competes
with long distance road and rail passenger traffic and, though not comparable
in volume to these modes, serves an essential transport function. The
domestic air carrier, Thai Airways Co. Ltd., is owned by the Government and



-3-
has a defacto monopoly on internal routes. Thai International Airline Co.
Ltd., of which the Government is the principal shareholder, carries all
international traffic.
B. Transport Demand
1.08      Roads are the dominant mode of transport for passengers and freight
in Thailand (Tables 1 and 2). In 1976, combined public passenger traffic
outside Bangkok for railways and roads was about 40 billion passenger-km, of
which the roads' share was 85%. Combined freight traffic for rail, roads and
inland waterways was estimated at about 50 million tons and over 13 billion
ton-km, of which the roads' share was about 70%. By tonnage carried, inland
waterways (8.5 million tons) ranked above rail (5.4 million tons), while in
ton-km, the positions were reversed (2.5 versus 1.4 billion ton-km), reflecting
the longer haul traffic handled by the railways.
1.09      Freight traffic is concentrated in the corridor between the gulf
area around Bangkok and northern Thailand and, to a lesser extent, along the
transport axes radiating south and northeast from the capital to the national
borders. Roads and railways share all trunkline traffic, and in the Chao
Phya basin inland waterways have captured a sizeable portion of this traffic.
Direction and size of the flows reflect Bangkok's central location and
dominance as a port and national consumption center, the rural character of
the outlying provinces and the advanced agricultural development of the
central plains. An estimated one-third to one-half of the country's total
1976 freight was composed of agricultural products, of which approximately
50% were exported. Imports (excluding those destined for Bangkok) and
exports combined total about 40% of all tonnage moved in Thailand.
1.10      Annual growth over the last ten years for the combined freight
traffic of road, rail and inland waterways was about 9%, as compared to an
average real growth in the GDP of 7%. Allowing for sustained growth of the
economy and for aggregate freight traffic to continue to advance faster than
the GDP, transport in Thailand can be expected to increase at about the same
rate until the early 1990s. Provided sufficient capacity is made available,
these growth rates would result in a tripling or quadrupling of traffic over
the next 15 years.
1.11      The distribution of freight traffic between roads, rail and water-
ways over the 1980's can be expected to follow the general trend of the last
ten years. Inland waterways and the railways will continue or complete their
transformation into medium or long distance bulk carriers, and roads will
increasingly dominate short haul and low volume traffic. Inland waterways
traffic, which is confined to the Chao Phya river basin, is projected to
grow by about 2.5% p.a. during the 1980's. Railway freight traffic is expected



-4-
to grow by about 4-5% p.a. over the same period, while rail passenger traffic
is projected to experience somewhat slower growth. Roads would absorb the
largest part of freight transport because of the competitiveness and flex-
ibility of the trucking industry, its ability to economically handle small
consignments, and the continued dispersion, growth and diversification of
agriculture. While railways and inland waterways traffic would grow, their
combined share of freight transport would drop by about one half from the
present 30%.
C. Transport Policy, Coordination and Investments
1.12      Enhanced by a steady supply of new transport infrastructure,
passenger and freight transport growth have aided Thailand's economic and
social development. The road transport industry is vigorous and competitive,
the railways are operationally efficient, and inland waterways have retained
a significant share of the central plains' transport. While public passenger
transport is regulated (e.g. the licensing of routes and the control of
schedules for road transport), freight transport is essentially unrestricted.
There is no evidence of significant inter-modal distortions and regulatory
restrictions. To verify this favorable conclusion, however, a study of road
user charges will be undertaken under the Sixth Highway Project, and the
marketing policy of the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) will be reviewed
under this project (para 4.02). A taxation policy for inland waterways
transport will also be devised under the waterway improvement study included
in the Sixth Highway Project. To enable the transport sector's good perfor-
mance in the economy to continue, future transport policies should be aimed
at two principal objectives: maintaining the present sector arrangement,
which is characterized by the parallel existence of efficient, competitive
and complementary modes; and providing transport capacities which are in line
with demand.
1.13      The Government currently is reviewing the size and composition of
infrastructure investments for the ongoing Plan (1977-81, Table 3). Transport
expenditure targets during the last Plan period (1972-76) were about US$1.04
billion equivalent, with 80% allocated to roads and 12% to railways. Transport
accounted for 20% of development expenditures. To accommodate the projected
growth in transport demand, and to support the Government policy of upgrading
conditions in rural Thailand, future transport investments must be considerably
increased. By tentative calculations, public expenditures under each of the
Five-Year Plans 1977-81, 1982-86 and 1987-1991 should reach an average of
US$ 1.9 billion equivalent (in 1977 prices, Table 4), an 80% increase over the
1972-76 amount. Railways would receive US$120-150 million in each Plan
period, representing 11% of the combined public investment for rail, road and
waterways transport. By 1991, the railways' share should be about 17% for
public passenger transport (rail and roads combined), and 10-12% for freight
transport (ton-km of rail, road and inland waterways traffic combined). SRT's
Investment Program and the project is consistent with the railway's projected
market share of the transport sector.



-5-
1.14      The Bank presently is involved in all transport modes, except
civil aviation, for which Thai development capabilities are adequate. The
Bank is currently providing assistance under the Sixth Highway Project for
the upgrading of approximately 700 km of provincial roads, improving highway
maintenance, and strengthening planning in the Department of Highways and
the Ministry of Communications (Transport Planning Unit). Studies are
included in the same project for the preparation of rural roads, provincial
roads, inland waterways and coastal ports projects. At the request of the
Government, the Bank is also providing assistance for the preparation of a
port development project at Sattahip.
II. RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Background and Past Bank Group Assistance to the Railways
2.01      Since the early 1950's, the Bank has made four loans totalling
US$52 million to the State Railway of Thailand (SRT): 35-TH, signed in
October 1950, for US$3 million; 128-TH signed in August 1955 for US$12 mil-
lion; 280-TH signed in April 1961 for US$22 million; and 898-TH signed in
June 1973 for US$15 million. The Bank's objective in these railway projects
was to enable SRT to exploit its inherent advantages in long distance haul of
bulk traffic. After an initial phase of postwar rehabilitation under the
first loan, SRT endeavored during 1962-71 to modernize its equipment and
replace its overaged assets. Assisted by the Bank's second loan, SRT acquired
30 diesel locomotives and improved its telecommunications. The Bank's third
loan enabled SRT to acquire 20 additional diesel locomotives and 1,650 freight
cars, replace 600 km of track rails, and improve signalling and telecommuni-
cations. The fourth loan (for rehabilitation of track and bridges, acqui-
sition of rolling stock, and modernization of workshop facilities), emphasized
reduced operating costs through the elimination of steam traction.
2.02      The first two railway projects were completed on schedule.  About
US$7.5 million of the third loan, earmarked for the purchase of 40 locomotives,
was cancelled when the Borrower chose to purchase the locomotives through
procedures which were not in conformance with Bank Group Guidelines. About
80% of the fourth project was completed by the scheduled date (September 30,
1976), but delays in procurement have deferred the manufacture of part of the
rolling stock and the replacement of about 200 km of track to the 1977-81
investment program. US$14.5 million of the original US$15.0 million loan
amount has been disbursed; the US$0.5 million balance, representing the
retention money on disputed contracts together with the cost of two shunting
locomotives, has been cancelled at the request of the Borrower. Cumbersome
procurement procedures have been a prime cause of past delays in the above
Bank projects. Steps have been taken, or have been agreed to by SRT
(para. 3.10), to prevent similar occurences in future.

B. SRT Organization
Legislation
2.03      Under the State Railway of Thailand Act of June 5, 1951, SRT took
over the functions of the Ministry of Communications' Railway Department, and
became a separate legal entity. Two amending acts (June 11, 1959 and July 19,
1966) introduced minor modifications to the 1951 Act. The 1959 amendment
gives overall supervisory power to the Minister of Communications, including
veto power over any action by SRT which is deemed inconsistent with Government
policy. A Board of Commissioners (consisting of a chairman and four to six
members), appointed by the Council of Ministers, formulates policy and super-
vises the general affairs of SRT. The Council of Ministers approves the
capital budget, the construction or abandonment of railway lines, the sale
of immovable property, the borrowing of money, and the setting of standard
rates and charges.
Management
2.04      The Board appoints, with approval of the Council of Ministers, a
General Manager who is responsible for the management and administration of
SRT and serves as an ex-officio Board member. Chart 18916 shows SRT's
present organization, which generally is on a functional department basis.
In 1976, top management was reorganized to place day-to-day operations under
two Deputy General Managers reporting to the General Manager.
Staff
2.05      SRT staff training facilities, located at a Railway Training Center
in Bangkok, are generally adequate. For training in specialized fields, SRT
sends a limited number of staff to local universities and foreign training
institutions. The number of supervisory staff trained in costing, marketing
and planning has so far been critically low, but SRT is now making satisfac-
tory arrangements to address this problem. In 1979, several railway officers
will be sent abroad for academic or professional training, and similar
training programs are planned for subsequent years.
2.06      SRT has competent officers and staff discipline is good.  Staff size
was 29,900 employees at the end of fiscal year 1977, including 28,500 permanent
and 1,400 temporary (generally unskilled) employees. Productivity per man
was 287,000 traffic units (ton-km + passenger-km) in 1977, having increased
at an average of 8% per annum during the past five years; this compares
favorably with the record of other railways in the region. Although total
staff has decreased by about 4,000 employees since 1972, SRT will explore
the scope for further reductions in staffing levels.
2.07      Labor-management relations, which had been excellent up to 1973,
were disturbed in 1974/75 by disputes over wage compensation for abnormal
increase in the cost of living. Liberalized allowances and a general pay



- 7 -
raise restored satisfactory relations; further, a labor welfare division
was set up in the personnel department to deal with staff grievances.
SRT salaries, which have kept pace with the consumer price index since 1972,
are generally higher than those for corresponding grades in Government
service, but lower than those in private industry.
C. Facilities
The System
2.08      As of September 30, 1977, SRT operated about 3,800 route-km of
meter gauge system (Table 5). Except for 90 km of double track between
Bangkok and Ban Pachi junction on the northern line, the route is single
track. Four trunk lines radiate from Bangkok: north to Chiang Mai, northeast
to the Laotian border, east to the border of Kampuchea, and south to the
Malaysian border. The Maeklong line of 67 route-km serves the west side of
the Bangkok area and is isolated from the main network. As of 1977, SRT had
9 branch lines with a total route length of about 660 km, including part of
the eastern and Maeklong lines (Map 13621); one of them (29 km route length),
was closed down in 1978. The Government is considering construction, under
its own financing, of a new 130 km line connecting Chacheongsao (a station
61 km from Bangkok on the eastern line) to the deep sea port and proposed
industrial area of Sattahip. The merits of the rail line extension will be
reviewed under a study of Thailand's eastern seaboard development, which is
included in the Bangkok Traffic Management Project.
Track
2.09      Except for about 250 km near Chiang Mai, where the maximum gradient
and the minimum curve radius are 2.6% and 180 m respectively, the main lines
of SRT are laid with less than 1% gradient and curve radii greater than
400 m. Curve length represents about 12% of total track on the system. There
are 2,000 m of tunnels, and 2,467 bridges, of which 834 are wooden; SRT plans
to gradually rebuild the latter with concrete structures, and to strengthen
or replace weak steel bridges. Of the 3,920 km of main line track (including
90 km of double track), 2,598 km are laid with 70 lb/yd rails, 393 km with
80 lb/yd rails, and 732 km with 60 and 50 lb/yd rails. Table 6 details
the disposition and age of rails. SRT's plans to replace the 60 lb/yd rails
on the main line with 70/80 lb/yd rails. About 61% of the main line rails
are welded of 42-144 m lengths. Welding of rail joints is being extended,
and a few experimental rail lengths, continuous between stations, have also
been installed. Sleepers on the main running tracks (spaced 65 cm between
centers) are 90% wooden, with or without tie plates; the balance which are
fabricated from prestressed concrete are manufactured locally. The ballast
consists of crushed stone, 20 cm in depth. Maximum permissible axle load on
the main lines is now 14 tons, and maximum speed is 80 km/hr. However, there
are a large number of permanent speed restrictions due to weak bridges and
sharp curves. The roadbed is generally stable, and track maintenance and
riding quality are good.



-8-
Signalling
2.10      Signalling and interlocking arrangements at SRT's 450 stations vary
from modern, all-route-relay interlocking and color light signalling (in the
Bangkok area), to hand-operated points with no signals. Standard equipment
for the main lines is mechanical interlocking with warner, home and starter
semaphore signals. In the past five years, SRT has installed full interlocking
at 85 stations and tokenless block instruments at 35 stations. Despite this,
about 15% of the stations on the northern line and about 36% on the southern
line are not fully interlocked, and many stations are worked only by hand-
operated, key-locked points. SRT plans to further improve signalling and
interlocking under this project (para. 3.17).
Telecommunications
2.11      The SRT telecommunications network consists mainly of three-channel
carrier telephones at 13 dispatching offices and a telephone network. The
Bangkok area also has a 300-line telephone exchange, which is more than
25 years old. There are frequent breakdowns on the network, and spare parts
are generally unavailable. Under the proposed project SRT plans to replace
the old telecommunications equipment with a 12-channel carrier telephone
system and a 500-line telephone exchange (para 3.16).
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.12      Between 1972 and 1976, SRT withdrew 192 steam locomotives from
service. As of September 30, 1977 (Table 7), its fleet consisted of 243
diesel locomotives (203 main line, 40 shunters), 39 steam locomotives in
emergency reserve, 102 rail cars (53 powered, 49 trailers), 1,052 passenger
cars (1,045 bogies, 7 four-wheelers) and 9,267 freight cars (6,621 four-
wheelers, 2,646 bogies). SRT's 1977-81 investment program includes pro-
curement of another 30 main line diesel locomotives, 130 passenger cars and
273 freight cars (paras. 3.06-3.09). The freight and passenger cars will
be manufactured at SRT's Makkasan workshop.
2.13      Twenty-seven diesel locomotives (950 hp), supplied by the Hitachi
Company of Japan, are more than 17 years old. Their performance and relia-
bility are poor. After the manufacturer stopped production of the engine
some years ago, the old parts were locally repaired, resulting in further
reduced performance. Such repairs are becoming increasingly difficult and
an estimated 19 of the locomotives are being replaced under the project
(para.3.06).  About 39 passenger and 1,360 freight cars (about 20%) are 40
or more years old. Under the project, the 39 passenger cars will be replaced.
Together with the overaged freight cars and surplus steam locomotives (ex-
cluding those in emergency reserve), they will be sold.
Workshops and Sheds
2.14      SRT's mechanical workshop facilities include a central workshop at
Makkasan, which handles major overhauls of locomotives (including rail
cars) and rolling stock, together with the manufacture of passenger and



freight cars. There are three regional workshops at Uttaradit, Korat and
Thung Song. These handle some unscheduled repairs, as well as overflow heavy
repairs from the Makkasan workshop. With the increase of diesel locomotives
in SRT's fleet, the repair and overhaul facilities at Makkasan (which
originally serviced only steam locomotives) were organized on a makeshift
basis to accomodate both steam and diesel engines. After the elimination of
steam traction, a better arrangement of the work flow for diesel locomotive
overhaul became possible. However, the building which was formerly used for
steam locomotive overhaul has recently been dismantled because it was unsafe;
it will be replaced under the project by a new structure with overhaul
facilites for diesel locomotives, including new overhead travelling cranes
(para. 3.18).
2.15      Daily maintenance of diesel locomotives is provided at four main
depots: Bang Sue, Uttaradit, Had Yai and Nakhon Ratchasima with the shop at
Bang Sue being the largest and best equipped.  Annual maintenance of diesel
locomotives, formerly undertaken at Makkasan, has been temporarily shifted to
the regional locomotive sheds. On the whole, facilities for the maintenance
and overhaul of motive power and rolling stock are well organized. With the
new building and some equipment additions included in the project, the
facilities will be adequate for some time to come.
Other Property
2.16      The major marshalling yard at Bang Sue has been modernized and
equipped with mechanical retarders; the capacity of regional yards at Sila
At, Had Yai and Thung Song has been increased. The buildings, stations and
offices and general plant of the railway are well maintained.
D. Traffic
Passenger vs. Freight Traffic
2.17      Passenger transport traditionally has dominated SRT operations and
revenues. In 1977, it accounted for 56% (16.2 million) of total revenue
train-km, with freight and mixed trains claiming 31% (8.9 million) and 13%
(3.7 million) respectively. Passenger traffic also earned 54% of total
revenues, while freight yielded 40% and other sources 6%. However, these
ratios could gradually change in the future. Some passenger services appear
vulnerable as road sections paralleling rail lines are nearing completion,
and costs and tariffs of rail passenger services, on the average, place SRT
in a tight competitive position. Freight traffic, by contrast, appears to
have an established market based on cost-advantages over competitors.
Freight and passenger growth rates projected for 1977-81 reflect this
assessment (paras. 2.22 and 2.25). A profitability analysis of rail services
is included in this project (para. 4.02) to provide SRT with a rational basis
for its future service and marketing policy.



- 10 -
Passenger Traffic
2.18       From 1967-78, passenger traffic increased from about 46 million
passengers and 3,600 million passenger-km to 59 million passengers and
6,100 million passenger-km (Table 8). Growth was steady through 1974
(passengers) or 1975 (passenger-km), but the number of passenger-km has been
stagnant between 1975 and 1977, and the number of passengers in these years
was equal to or below the 1974 level. The main reason for this development
was a sharp tariff increase in 1975 (para. 2.28), the first in more than
20 years. On average, passengers and passenger-km have increased since 1967
by about 2% p.a. and 5% p.a. respectively.
2.19      Third class traffic represents 98% of the total number of passengers
and 90% of passenger-km. First and second class traffic share the remainder.
Average distance travelled by third class passengers is 90 km; the other two
classes range from 500 to 800 km. Charges per passenger-km for second and
third class travel are approximately 64% and 40% respectively of the amount
charged for first class travel.
2.20      Urban Bangkok with its main railway terminal and Sam Sem, Bang Sue
and Thon Buri stations generates about 12% of all passenger trips on SRT's
network. The Greater Bangkok area which includes urban Bangkok, about 90 km
of the northern line up to Ban Pachi, and the entire eastern line contributes
about 24% of total traffic (trips). The northern line, from Ban Pachi
northward generates 25% of all journeys; the northeastern line extending from
the same station 21%; and the southern line 30%. Greater Bangkok generates
about 33% of passengers-km, 80% of which originate in urban Bangkok. The
north-eastern line has 18%, the northern line 21%, and the southern line 28%.
Thus, passenger transport is distributed fairly evenly over the networks'
principal lines. SRT caters largely to the rural population: less than 7%
of all trips on SRT can be classified as Bangkok urban and commuter traffic.
In passenger-km, Bangkok urban and commuter traffic amounts to only 2%.
2.21      Passenger traffic in recent years has been determined by the steady
rise in the real incomes of the population, the progressive build-up of the
national and provincial road networks, the highly competitive bus transport
system and the tariff policy of SRT. Railway tariffs have had the most
visible effect. When raised in 1975 by a weighted average of about 26%, for
the first time in more than 20 years, the number of passengers fell by
about 7% the following year, and passenger-km growth levelled off.
2.22      Future passenger traffic will be conditioned by the same factors
noted above. Over the 1977-81 Plan period, the network of national and
provincial roads running in proximity to the railways will be nearly completed.
Rail tariffs will need periodic adjustment to meet financial and economic
targets. For the remainder of the Plan period, therefore, the appraisal mis-
sion projects an overall traffic growth of no more than 3-4.5% p.a. system-
wide. Growth rates are expected to vary with travel classes, origins and
destinations, and the level of road competition. The aforementioned growth
rates in overall passenger traffic are at variance with SRT's own estimate of
about 6% p.a., which is based on the assumption that rates could be kept
almost constant in nominal terms implying a substantial decrease in real



- 11 -
terms over the Plan period. In fact, there remains considerable uncertainty
about the future rate of passenger traffic growth, and future rail traffic
will to a large measure depend on SRT's future marketing policy (para. 4.02)
and ability to keep its cost in check. This project is designed to support
SRT in these undertakings.
Freight Traffic
2.23      SRT's carload traffic, representing about 95% of total freight
traffic, has grown from 4.7 million tons and 1,900 million ton-km in 1967 to
about 6.2 million tons and 2,800 million ton-km in 1978 (Table 9). Average
growth rates over the period have been 2.5% p.a. and 3.6% p.a. respectively,
compared to a nationwide growth in transported goods of 9% p.a. over the
same period. Between 1972 and 1975, total transport stagnated due to the
de-escalation of the Vietnam war, but a renewed rise began in 1976 and 1977.
The 1978 traffic declined because of the economic effects of a severe
drought, but growth is expected to be resumed from 1979 on.
2.24      Over the 1967-1978 period, petroleum products, cement/marl and
rice have dominated SRT's freight traffic. While their combined share of
total ton-km has remained constant (at slightly over 50%), their share of
total tonnages has risen from 53% to about 69% over the period. Forestry
and agricultural products, including rice, accounted for about 28% of total
1978 ton-km; followed by petroleum products with 26%, and cement/marl with
14%. In contrast to passenger traffic, which is more evenly distributed
over the four principle rail lines, 66% of all freight traffic (in ton-km)
was concentrated in 1976 on the northern line. The southern line followed
with 23%, and the northeastern line with 11%; the eastern line carried only
negligible freight. Average haul for all goods transported is about 480 km:
average distance for petroleum products is 470 km; for cement and marl,
about 200 km; and for rice, about 750 km.
2.25      SRT freight traffic is dominated by bulk goods carried in carloads
over medium and long distances. This is appropriate, in view of the competi-
tion from road transport over shorter distances, the capacity of waterway
transport in the central plains, and SRT's economies of scale. Average rail
freight costs including transshipment costs (B 0.24/ton-km) are well below
those of road transport (B 0.33/ton-km). Over the 1977-81 period, SRT
expects to expand its total freight market by 6.5% (tons) p.a. and 4.7%
(ton-km) p.a. Annual growth in petroleum products transport would be about
5.8% (tons) and 9.5% (ton-km), and cement and marl tonnages would grow by
about 10.5% and 6.7% respectively (Table 9). These targets are realistic
and reflect SRT's competitive strength and the successful work of its
Marketing Department established in 1975. To project freight traffic, SRT
separately analyzed each of the 12 most important commodities, which together
represent 80% of all freight tonnage. Particular care was taken in the
forecast of petroleum products and cement, which was based on projected
origin - destination matrices. The results were consistent with the respec-
tive industries' production targets.
2.26      The forecast beyond 1981 is for continued growth in SRT freight
transport even taking into account that the trunk road system along SRT's
northern line (which carried 66% of all rail freight in 1976) will be



- 12 -
completed in the early 1980s, and that inland waterway improvements are
scheduled to be completed around the same time. Implementation of the
proposed project will improve rail efficiency. Further impetus will come
from the expanding role of SRT's Marketing Department.
E. Operations
2.27      Table 10 summarizes SRT operations for 1972-77.  Operating effi-
ciency has significantly improved since the completion of the dieseli-
zation program in 1976. The average turnaround time for freight cars has
improved from 9 days in 1975 to 7.3 days 1977. During the same period, the
average load per car has increased from 12.4 tons to 13.0 tons. Further,
net ton-km per available box car (four-wheeler), an important index of
efficiency, has also risen from 239,000 ton-km to 302,000 ton-km per annum.
During 1972-77, the car-km per available car day has increased by 9% and 31%
for freight and passenger cars respectively, and the average speed of freight
trains has improved by 27%. On the other hand, expected increases in the
availability of locomotives and freight cars have not wholly materialized:
availability at 81% and 92.5% respectively, is lower than the feasible targets
of 85% and 95%. Better workshop and shed facilities, planned under this
project, should improve the situation. Operational targets are given in
para. 3.23.
F. Tariffs and Costs
2.28      Tariffs are uniform throughout the entire railway system.  The
tariffs consist of standard rates plus variations from these standard rates.
Changes in standard rates require Cabinet approval, while Section 39 of
the State Railway of Thailand Act of 1975 vests the authority for certain
standard rates variations in SRT's Board of Commissioners. However, in prac-
tice all tariff changes require the approval of SRT's Board of Commissioners,
the Minister of Communications, various Government agencies, and the Cabinet.
This lengthy rate change procedure together with Government's concern for the
inflationary impact of rate increases had resulted in tariffs remaining
largely unchanged for twenty years until November 1975, when standard rates
were substantially increased.  Freight rates will again be increased in
January 1979.
2.29      Details of the October/November 1975 and January 1979 tariff in-
creases are set forth in Tables 11 and 12. The fiscal 1976 tariff changes
yielded a 26% increase in revenue/pass-km and an 18% increase in revenue/ton-
km in 1977 relative to fiscal 1975. The resulting incremental revenue of 270
million Baht in 1977 enabled SRT to return to profitability after three con-
secutive years of operating deficits (Table 13). The January 1979 tariff in-
creases represent an approximately 9.5% average increase in revenue/ton-km of
general freight together with an estimated B 40 million increase in petroleum
revenue in fiscal 1979. Further tariff increases will be necessary to fully
restore and maintain SRT's financial viability (para. 5.08).



- 13 -
2.30      Due to improved operating efficiency, SRT costs per traffic unit
have decreased in real term by 25% over the past five years (para. 5.04). An
analysis of the average fixed and variable costs of transporting passenger
and freight traffic in fiscal 1976 was completed by SRT with the assistance
of consultants in December 1977. Unit variable costs extracted from this
study are presented below together with unit revenue comparisons.
Passenger          Freight
(per pass-km)    (per ton-km)
Unit revenues               0.139               0.203
Unit variable costs
(ex-depreciation)         0.091                0.134
Variable costs as % of
revenue                   65%                  66%
As can be seen, the relative cash profitability of moving additional passengers
and additional freight are approximately equal. Applying historical alloca-
tions of the fixed costs to passenger and freight traffic, average fully
distributed costs in 1976 (including depreciation on an historic basis and
excluding interest charges) were approximately equal to corresponding revenues.
Concerning freight services, there appears to be scope for substantial profit-
ability in that unit costs for railway freight traffic are well below those
for trucking. Using bus tariffs as a proxy for costs, it appears that the
cost advantage of rail passenger over bus traffic is more limited. However,
SRT's passenger traffic is comprised of a wide spectrum of profitability
levels. Therefore, to obtain a proper understanding of its profit structure,
SRT has agreed to undertake a profitability analysis of its services under
the project (para. 4.02).
G. Budget, Accounting and Audit
Budgets
2.31      SRT prepares detailed annual operating and capital budgets.  While
the capital budget has to be approved by the Cabinet, the operating budget
requires approval of SRT's Board of Commissioners and is submitted to the
Cabinet for information only. There is reasonable flexibility in subsequently
reallocating funds among existing items in the capital budget; however,
management has limited flexibility with regard to the addition of items not
already included in the Cabinet-approved capital program. Capital expend-
itures are carefully controlled in relation to the approved program by the
Bureau of the Budget.
Accounting
2.32      The accounting system follows commercial accounting practice, and
the staff in the Accounting Department is experienced and qualified.
Depreciation of fixed assets is based on original cost and estimated useful



- 14 -
life; the cost of rail replacements is charged to a renewals fund which is
maintained on a satisfactory basis. Manual accounting procedures are being
replaced successfully by computer processing.
2.33      Final annual accounts are prepared within three months of the end
of the fiscal year. For more timely financial and traffic information, SRT
management receives a monthly report termed the Quick Report. Assembling the
information takes about 32 days from the end of the period covered. To
increase its usefulness in controlling SRT's operations, SRT will shorten
its production time to three weeks.
Audit
2.34      External auditing is the responsibility of the Government's Audit
Council whose staff conducts a continuous audit of SRT's annual financial
performance. Section 5.02(a) of the Loan Agreement of Loan 898-TH requires
SRT to furnish the Bank with audited financial statements within five months
of the end of each fiscal year. The period has been extended to six months
under this project to allow for additional time, which proved necessary in the
past.
H. Revaluation of Assets
2.35       Since SRT's assets have not been revalued for about 25 years, the
present depreciation charges distort SRT's financial results. Accordingly,
SRT has agreed to revalue its assets not later than March 31, 1980 and every
four years thereafter.
I. Uneconomic Lines and Services
2.36       As of mid-1978, SRT operated eight branch lines with a total length
of about 630 km (mostly on the southern line), including part of the eastern
and Maeklong lines. As the profitability of operating these branch lines was
seriously in doubt, technical assistance was provided under Loan 898-TH to
identify uneconomic services, establish a methodology for evaluating losses,
and estimate losses on two typical branch lines. The consultants (CPCS)
established the required methodology and estimated 1975 losses on the Nang Pla
Duk-Nam Tok and Bangkok-Aranyaprathat lines. The methodology will enable SRT
to determine losses on the other branch lines, and to approach the Government
regarding compensation for operating those branch lines to be retained for
social and political reasons. In fact, the Government has approved, in prin-
ciple, a subsidy of approximately 210 million Baht for losses on uneconomic
branch lines over the 1977-81 Plan period. SRT has (i) reaffirmed Section
3.05(b) of the Loan Agreement of Loan 898-TH requiring it to make arrangements
with the Government for adequate compensation for operating uneconomic branch
lines, and (ii) agreed to complete the analysis of the remaining six branch
lines by the end of fiscal 1979 to expedite such compensation. In turn, the
Government has agreed to establish a procedure under which SRT will be promptly
reimbursed for branch line losses.



- 15 -
2.37      The Cabinet has directed the National Economic and Social Develop-
ment Board, together with the Ministry of Communications and SRT, to study
in detail the costs and benefits of discontinuing each of the existing
uneconomic branch lines. The study will include recommendations relating to
alternative methods of providing services handled by such uneconomic branch
lines. Studies on individual branch lines will be forwarded to the Bank for
its information and comments.
2.38      Under the technical assistance provided under Loan 898-TH, the
consultants examined also the question of consolidating freight booking
stations, taking note of the recent closing of a few stations by SRT. They
concluded that, for less than car loads, consolidating stations might not
result in significant economies while depriving customers at remote and
wayside stations of a useful service. Regarding carload traffic, they recom-
mended consolidation of freight booking points to reduce uneconomic operation
where road and trucking facilities are available. Accordingly, SRT is
reviewing the scope for further traffic consolidation.

III. INVESTMENT PLAN AND PROJECT
A. Investment Plan
3.01      SRT's 1972-76 Investment Plan sought to achieve the complete
dieselization of the locomotive fleet, the strengthening of track, and the
expansion of SRT's capacity to meet expected traffic increases. These
objectives were largely accomplished. The 1977-81 Investment Plan will
further improve operational efficiency by replacing worn out and obsolete
assets and expanding transport capacity in line with projected demand.
3.02      The 1977-81 Investment Plan was carefully designed by SRT and
jointly reviewed by SRT and the appraisal mission. Composition and size
were tentatively agreed during appraisal, and subsequently finalized to
reflect most recent data changes. The Plan is well justified and within
SRT's implementation capabilities. It will be financed jointly by SRT, the
Government, the Bank and bilateral sources. During the Plan period, SRT
will also strengthen planning and marketing as an important complement to
physical and operational improvements. The 1977-81 Investment Plan is
summarized below, and a year-by-year breakdown is given in Tables 14A and
14B.

B. Project Definition and Loan
3.03      The project consists of the last three years of SRT's 1977-81 In-
vestment Plan; its estimated cost, including contingencies, is about US$101
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about US$63 million
equivalent or 63%.
3.04      The loan will cover the foreign currency cost of:  new materials for
the production of passenger coaches; procurement of monoblock concrete ties
and of fasteners for two block concrete ties; replacement and strengthenifig
of steel bridges; and improvement of telecommunications, signalling and
workshops. The remaining foreign currency cost, principally for rail and
locomotives will be financed through Government funds and bilateral sources.

C. Project Description
(a) Acquisition of Motive Power and Rolling Stock
Locomotives
3.06      The project provides for the acquisition of 30 1,800 hp locomotives.
Concurrently about 19 Hitachi locomotives, whose engines can no longer be
repaired, will be withdrawn from service. After these locomotives are retired,
SRT will redeploy the existing motive power; of the new locomotives, 26 will
be utilized on freight and 4 on passenger trains. Table 17 shows the calcula-
tion of the number of locomotives required to carry the projected freight
traffic. Tables 18 and 19 show how the Hitachi locomotives will be replaced
and the disposition of all locomotives in 1981.
Passenger Cars
3.07      SRT's investment program 1977-81 includes the manufacture of
130 passenger cars. Of these, 59 third class coaches, 8 second class
sleepers and 12 second class air conditioned cars form part of the project.
Some materials procured under the 1972-76 Plan, are already in stock, and
the required balance of US$3.6 million will be imported under the project.
3.08      The breakdown of the passenger car acquisitions in replacements
and additions are shown in Table 20. The stock to be retired is old and
repairs are not possible without complete rebuilding at the cost of new
cars. Table 21 gives the composition of rolling stock capacity to meet
1977-81 traffic growth. In addition to new car construction, new rolling
stock capacity will be generated through redeployment of cars from surplus
districts, and conversion of first and second into third class cars.
Acquisition of second class air conditioned and sleeper coaches included in
the project is a means of improving SRT's service quality.
Freight Cars
3.09      The 1977-1981 investment program includes the manufacture of
273 freight cars for handling additional traffic. Of these, 30 oil tank
and 73 cement hopper cars are included in the project; in both cases, SRT
provides only bogie flat chassis, and the tanks are supplied by the oil and
cement companies. Table 22 shows car requirements for 1981.
3.10      Because of earlier overbuying, SRT has sufficient materials in stock
for the manufacture of all freight cars up to 1981, and even thereafter,
there will be a small surplus of steel channels, plates and sheets. During
1978, procurement procedures have been sufficiently streamlined to safeguard
against similar overstocking while speeding up procurement. In addition, SRT
has agreed to effect any further measures, which may prove necessary, to
ensure timely availability of material and adequate material control. The
ratio of inventories to annual material use will be gradually reduced during
the project implementation years.



- 19 -
(b) Track Rehabilitation (Table 23; Map 13622)
Rail Replacement
3.11      This project item covers rail replacement or rehabilitation of
919 km of track. Details are given in Table 23. The principal investment
benefits are reduced track maintenance and wear of rolling stock and increased
track capacity. Two hundred and thirteen km on the southern and 203 km on
the northern line will receive new rails. Renewal on the southern line was
justified under Loan 898-TH, but deferred to the 1977-81 Plan because of
delays due to the diversion of funds for the procurement of rolling stock
material and to prolonged procurement procedures. The new rails have already
been ordered and are being financed by the Government.
Sleeper Renewal
3.12      Replacement of deteriorated wooden sleepers to avoid track dete-
rioration is a continuous operation. Because wooden sleepers are becoming
increasingly expensive and scarce, the project provides for manufacture by
SRT of 150,000 two block prestressed concrete sleepers and purchase of
125,000 monoblock concrete sleepers.   The life of concrete sleepers is 40
years as compared to 10 years for wooden sleepers.
Bridge Rehabilitation
3.13      Train speed is severely restricted on 176 steel bridges which do
not have sufficient carrying capacity to cope with the 13.75 ton axle load of
SRT's new diesel locomotives at the line speed limit. Sixty-nine of the
bridges with a combined length of 2,875 meters are included in the 1977-81
Investment Program, and 60 of the bridges form part of the project; the
remaining bridges will be strengthened in the next Plan.
3.14      SRT has 834 timber bridges with speed restrictions because of train
safety. Their replacement with reinforced concrete slabs or girders is part of
an ongoing program which is carefully coordinated with the other elements of
track rehabilitation and signalling. The project provides for rehabilitating
118 of the high priority timber bridges with a combined length of 4,482 meters.
Equipment for Track Maintenance
3.15      Seven motor trolleys and 18 trailers will be acquired for quicker
movement of track maintenance equipment, material and men.
(c) Improvement of Telecommunications and Signalling
Telecommunications
3.16      SRT's telecommunications system, which consists of a carrier
telephone network and teleprinter facilities, is over 20 years old and
inadequate for the growing needs of administration and train operation.



- 20 -
SRT's 300-line telephone exchange at Bangkok is 25 years old and spare parts
are unavailable. Consequently, there are frequent communications breakdowns.
The project provides for the installation of a 12-channel carrier telephone
network, 51 sets of teleprinter equipment and a 500-line telephone exchange
at Bangkok, to replace the existing old equipment.
Signalling
3.17      Only 220 of SRT's stations have mechanical interlocking with
adequate signalling. On 60 stations (7 on northern and 53 on southern
line), interlocking is achieved through hand-operated key locked points and
consequently train operations are slow and unsafe. Installation of full
mechanical interlocking at 15 stations and tokenless block instruments
and color light signals at 30 stations are included in the project. As a
result, there will be an average gain of two minutes per station in train
passing where tokenless block instruments are installed, and time gains will
be even greater where mechanical interlocking is introduced.
(d) Workshop Improvement
3.18      This item consists of (a) reconstruction of the old steam locomotive
shop (at Makkasan), dismantled in 1977 because it was unsafe; and (b) procure-
ment of two new 25-ton capacity overhead cranes and other essential equipment
for diesel locomotive overhaul (Table 24). Investments under (a) and (b) are
expected to reduce the time for major locomotive overhaul from the present
23 days to 18 days and to improve locomotive availability from 81% to 84%.
(e) Other Investment Items
3.19      The principal component under this investment category is earth
filling for a second major passenger terminal at Bangkok. The existing main
station is used close to capacity and cannot be expanded. The main works on
the new terminal will be undertaken under the 1982-86 Plan. Other, minor
investment items are installation of barriers at 62 road crossings as a
public safety measure, construction of staff quarters, provision of offices
and purchase of office cars.
D. Cost Estimates
3.20      Project costs (Table 15) are based on estimated quantities and prices
as of June 1978, adjusted for inflation and physical contingencies. Physical
contingencies of 10% were included for all items, except for locomotives, and
new 80 lb/yd rails (for which contracts have been awarded). Most project items
(rolling stock manufacture, rail renewals, two block concrete sleeper manufac-
ture and bridge rehabilitation) have been undertaken by SRT in the past; costs
and quantities, therefore, are well-controlled. Price contingencies have been
included for all items, except new 80 lb/yd rails, locomotives, and material
in stock for the manufacture of rolling stock. Assumed annual price increases
for local currency expenditures are 7.5% in 1978 and 1979, and 7% in 1980 and
1981.



- 21 -
For foreign. currency expenditures the assumed increases are 6.5% in 1978 and
1979, and 6% in 1980 and 1981. Physical and price contingencies on all items
total about 9% of project cost.
E. Financing Plan
3.21      P'roposed financing of project cost, estimated at US$100.9 million
equivalent, will be as follows:
Amount including contingencies
(US$ million)
IBRD loan                              16.7
Bilateral financing (locomotives)    32.4
Government                             34.2
SRT                                    17.6
Total                              100.9
F. Project Implementation
3.22      SRT will be responsible for implementing the project.  Table 25
shows the project execution schedule and Table 26, a detailed procurement
plan. Rolling stock will be manufactured in SRT's workshop with imported
material and components; manufacturing costs, including local taxes, will
be, on average, about 25% lower than c.i.f. costs of imported stock.
Monoblock concrete sleepers will be manufactured by local contractors,
while SRT will produce the two block concrete ties, for which they have
adequate production capacity and expertise.
G. Action Plan
3.23      Locomotive and rolling stock requirements during the Investment
Plan period (1977-1981) are based on traffic forecasts in Tables 8 and 9, and
on the following operational targets:

/a  Overdue heavy overhauls will be carried out in 1979-80 with an average of
three sets always under repair; consequently, railcar availability will
decrease in this period.
/b  Because of redeployment of locomotives and traffic flows, new 1800 hp
locomotives may produce less than 65 million net ton-km p.a.
During negotiations, SRT agreed to draw up an action plan which will be the
basis for achieving the operational forecasts indtcated above. Measures to
be included in such plan are:
(a) Reduction of locomotive accident rate from actual 6% of tne fleet
to less than 3% in 1981 through:



- 23 -
(i)  strictly enforcing train working regulation;
(ii) training new staff and retraining permanent staff on accident
prevention;
(iii) increasing inspections of Traffic Department Officers riding
trains to control services in line, stations and yards; and
(iv) installing barriers in level crossings that record higher
accident frequency following the agreed program (62 grade
crossing barriers in the 1979-81 period).
(b)  Iiiprovement of service efficiency through:
(i)  decreasing mixed trains services from 3.6 million km in 1977
to less than 3 million in 1981;
(ii) analyzing factors that influence service efficiency beginning
with trains for major commodities and introducing rules that
assure sufficient flexibility to modify train formation, time-
tables, locomotive rosters so as to adapt services to market
fluctuations; and
(iii)  improving average speed of passenger and freight trains through
the implementation of the track rehabilitation program co-
ordinated with bridge strengthening, signalling and telecommuni-
cation improvement in major sections of the northern line.
H. Procurement
3.24      All items to be procured under the loan except monoblock
concrete sleepers and associated machinery and minor items not exceeding
US$5,000 inL value each, will be subject to international competitive bidding
(ICB), in accordance with Bank guidelines. In bid evaluation, Thai equipment
manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of c.i.f. cost of
competing imports or the relevant prevailing level of customs duties, which-
ever is lower. Because of high ocean transport costs, concrete monoblock
sleepers will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures accept-
able to the Bank. Imported machinery and materials required to manufacture
these sleepers will be purchased through negotiation with qualified suppliers
to assure quality and safety of the sleepers.  Together, loan financing of
monoblock sleepers will amount to US$2.2 million. Purchase of minor items not
exceeding US$5,000 each and US$250,000 in the aggregate will be carried out in
accordance with local procedures.
I. Disbursements
3.25      Disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(a)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment
and material;



- 24 -
(b) 100% of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment
and material if local bidders are successful in ICB; and
(c) 65% of total expenditures for items procured locally.
Bank disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1982. An
estimated quarterly schedule of disbursements is given in Table 27.
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. SRT's Transport Role
4.01      Over the last 20 to 30 years road transport has become the leading
mode in Thailand. Its dominance is expected to increase during the 1980s on
account of its cost and service characteristics and the continued growth and
dispersion of agriculture. Railways (and inland waterways transport) will
also continue to expand but at a slower pace. The railway's best prospects
are in bulk and trunkline freight traffic. The development of future rail
passenger transport is more uncertain in view of the road sectors competitive
strength. Until a few years ago, SRT provided monopoly passenger service
in several transport corridors, but the competitive situation has since
changed. Irrespective, however, of the precise nature of future developments
in transport markets, the railway will remain a vital component of Thailand's
transport system, and SRT's 1977-81 Investment Plan has been defined on this
premise.
4.02      To reduce the uncertainty about future transport markets and to
assure a rational service and marketing policy, SRT has agreed to: undertake
not later than December 31, 1979, a profitability study of its services; and
implement the study's recommendations in agreement with the Bank. The study
will include an examination of the profitability of each of the 12 commodities
with the largest yearly tonnages by line, distance, class and car and train
load transport. The analysis of passenger traffic will distinguish between
mixed, ordinary rapid and express trains, and between lines and distances.
B. Evaluation Summary
4.03      The 1977-1981 Investment Plan is well prepared, justified and
within SRT's implementation capabilities. About 55% of the Plan focuses
on rehabilitation or replacement of assets - track infrastructure, telecommuni-
cations, signalling, workshops, rolling stock and locomotives. The remaining
45% of investments are primarily for acquisition of rolling stock and
locomotives to accommodate traffic increases. Because of Plan's composition,
and the care taken in traffic estimation, the investments are well shielded
against potential variations in traffic growth.



- 25 -
4.04       Economic returns on the Investment Plan were computed for the
fiscal years 1979-81, the project period. All costs used in the economic
analysis are financial costs less taxes. The overall return for the evaluated
items, representing about 73% of the 1979-81 program (paras. 4.04, 4.07 and
4.08) is 17% with a range of 11 - 64% for major components (Table 28).
Traffic projections were discussed earlier and details of the economic
evaluation are given below.
C. Evaluation Details
Acquisition of Motive Power and Rolling Stock
4.05       Thirty locomotives will be procured under the project.  Eight
will replace intermediary locomotives (Table 18), which, in turn, will be
shifted to passenger and mixed trains run primarily on branch lines. Since
these lines are recognized as uneconomic and the Government is committed to
reimburse SRT for losses incurred in their operation, no economic return
has been computed for these 8 locomotives. An economic evaluation has been
made, however, for the remaining 22 units (paras. 4.05 and 4.06); three of
them will replace existing freight haulage capacity, 15 will meet freight and
4 passenger traffic growth.
4.06       Benefits from investments in passenger trains were calculated on
projected rail fare receipts and corresponding Long Run Marginal Costs
(LRMC). For example, fare receipts are about B 0.14 (1977) per passenger-km
on the average, and LRMC are about 70% of fares. Receipts and LRMC vary with
travel classes, train categories and services. By comparison, travel charges
for ordinary intercity buses are B 0.11 (1977) per passenger-km, and for
airconditiorted buses, tariffs are about B 0.20. Bus fares are thought to
follow closely bus costs. A twenty year investment life was assumed for the
motive power and rolling stock. On the basis of these data, the overall
economic returns are 36% for replacement investments in coaches, and 15% for
the investments (4 locomotives and rolling stock) to accomodate new traffic.
The high ret:urns for replacement investments (coaches) are achieved through
the use of existing motive power.
4.07       Calculation of economic returns for investments in freight locomo-
tives and wagons was based on a comparison of road and rail haulage costs.
Average economic cost of moving freight by rail (1977) is about B 0.24
per ton-km, including capital cost of rolling stock and motive power.
Comparative road transport costs about B 0.33 per ton-km, including truck
investments. A 20-year life was again assumed for rail investments. For
the 3 new replacement locomotives, the rate of return is 20%; for new traffic
carrying capacity (15 locomotives and freight wagons), the return is 19%.
Track RehabiLlitation
4.08       Track rehabilitation under the project consists of replacing and
reconditioning rails, substitution of concrete for wooden sleepers and the



- 26 -
strengthening or replacement of timber and steel bridges. Investments
in new rails on the southern line are carried over from the previous Plan;
these were found justified under the Fourth Railway Project and have been
excluded fromn the present economic analysis. Quantified benefits from track
rehabilitation are savings in infrastructure maintenance cost, increased
track capacity and faster operations resulting in reduced rolling stock
requirements. Nonquantified benefits, excluded from the calculation, are
safer train movements. The overall return is 12%; with returns for the
principal components in this investment category ranging from 11% to 13%.
Improvement of Telecommunication
4.09      SRT's present telecommunications equipment was installed over
20 years ago and has frequent breakdowns. Administrative action is often
delayed by inadequate communication, and train movements are occasionally
hindered. A new telecommunications system, therefore, is amply justified.
Improvement of Signalling
4.10      Introduction of new signalling will increase operational safety and
line capacity, resulting in reduced locomotive and rolling stock requirements.
Sections where the new system will be installed presently carry 30 trains per
day; installation will save about 40 train-hours per day. Without quantifying
increased train safety, the economic return on the investment is 27%.
Workshop Improvements
4.11      Workshop improvements consist of two distinct investments:
(a) reconstruction of the central workshop building and installation of new
cranes at Makkasan; and (b) purchase of new equipment for overhauling
locomotives. Benefits of both (a) and (b) derive from increased availability
of locomotives, estimated at about 2% and 1% respectively for the entire
fleet. Rates of return are 64% and 48% respectively.
D. Sensitivity Analyses and Project Risks
4.12      Costs of SRT's planned investments are unlikely to deviate by
more than 10% from estimates for each major investment category. Cost
variation, in turn, would have only a minor effect on economic returns.
Unit benefits have an expected confidence range of 10%, except for those
benefits derived from investments to increase or maintain freight capacity.
in this case, benefits could vary up to 20% or 30%, due to a corresponding
variation in road haulage costs; the economic returns, however, would not
fall lower than 10%. Thus, a benefit reduction of 20% coupled with a cost
increase of 10% is a reasonable measure of the project's riskiness. On this
basis, the overall return would fall from 17% to 11%, indicating that the
investments have a low risk factor in addition to a good expected return.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      During the 1972-76 period, SRT's operating costs per traffic unit
decreased in real terms as a result of improved operations. However, due
to insufficient tariff relief, SRT's increased operating costs in these years
outpaced revenues, with resulting operating deficits in each of the fiscal
years 1974-76. Further, overbuying of materials for the construction of
freight/passenger cars (para. 5.05) and delayed Government subsidy for
operating deficits (para. 5.03) resulted in a rapid deterioration of SRT's
liquidity thereby impairing current operations. More recently, SRT, assisted
by tariff increases and limited wage awards, has returned to profitability.
There has also been an improvement in SRT's liquidity as a result of the
receipt in 1977/78 of Government funds for past operating deficits. SRT's
financial health may be further improved through a program of tariff adjust-
ments and timely injection of Government funds as discussed in para. 5.11.
The projected cash flow will then be sufficient to service debt, finance
current operations, and make a meaningful contribution to the Investment
Plan.

Financial performance in 1974-76 was substantially weaker than the appraisal
forecast of the Loan 898, and the returns on fixed assets in use were consistently
less than the 2% required under Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement for Loan
898. SRT's unsatisfactory financial experience in these years can be largely
explained by the Government's failure to increase tariffs sufficiently to
offset increases in operating expenses. From 1973-75, revenues followed traffic



- 29 -
closely, while working expenses increased about 66% due primarily to the
impact of inflation, with fuel expense increases of 129% and staff expense
increases of 59%. As a result SRT incurred operating deficits in 1974-76.
The loss in fiscal year 1976 includes non-recurring costs of certain heavy
repairs to passenger coaches. Although the health of SRT's operating finances
was substantially restored through the November 1975 tariff increase and
limited wage awards, the financial ratios for fiscal 1977 (Tables 13 and 29)
need further improvement. Appropriate steps to further strengthen and maintain
SRT's financial position are discussed in paras. 5.08 and 5.12.
5.03       Section 43 of the State Railway of Thailand Act of 1951 specifies
that the Government will subsidize any annual operating deficit incurred by
SRT. However, during the period 1974-76, the aggregate operating deficit as
defined by the Act was 412 million Baht, while the matching Government subsidy
paid during the period was only 105 million Baht, thereby contributing to
SRT's diminishing cash balances (para. 5.05). The aforementioned difference
between the operating deficit and the actual subsidy paid is due to a delay of
up to two years between the end of a fiscal year and receipt of the Government
subsidy. The delay is largely caused by SRT's inability to meet the deadline
for submission of operating deficit information to the national budget because
of the Government's requirement that such information must first be verified
by an audit. Therefore, to expedite compensation for any future operating
deficits, the Government has agreed to accept SRT's estimate of operating
deficits for the purposes of presentation in the national budget; appropriate
adjustments would be made thereafter upon receipt of SRT's year-end audit.
5.04       Tab:Le 30 depicts the impact of inflation on costs and revenues.
Working expenses per traffic unit increased nominally from 11.6 satang in 1972
to 15.3 Satang in 1977, but decreased in real terms to 8.8 satang in 1977.
The reduction resulted from improved operations due primarily to SRT's transition
from steam to diesel motive power, which was one of the main objectives of
Loan 898-TH. Average revenue per ton-km and per passenger-km, although enjoy-
ing the benef:its of the fiscal 1976 tariff adjustments, decreased in real
terms by 38% and 27% respectively over the 1972-77 period.
5.05       Balance sheet data for fiscal years 1974-77 are presented in Table 31
and summarized below:

Although the current ratio remained in the satisfactory range of 2.1x - 4.0x,
the liquidity ratio diminished sharply over the 1974-76 period, from 2.Ox to
0.4x, reflecting a deterioration of the cash account from 391 million Baht
in 1974 to 25 million Baht in 1976. (The ratio improved to 1.lx in 1977 as
a result of SRT's receipt of Government compensation for past operating
deficits.) The diminution in cash was paralleled by an unhealthy growth in
the material purchased for the construction of freight/passenger cars, pri-
marily accounted for by procurement difficulties referred to in para. 3.10.
Cash resources were further strained by an increase of about 20% in operating
inventories over the 1974-76 period. Steps to ensure appropriate levels of
liquidity through streamlining procurement procedures, limiting inventories
and maintaining adequate minimum cash balances are discussed in paras. 3.10
and 5.11.
5.06      Although SRT's long term debt increased about 25% from 1974 to 1977,
the debt/equity ratio remained modest, rising from 14/86 in 1974 to only 16/84
in 1977. The increase in the outstanding debt was largely due to the drawing
down of loans already negotiated, such as Bank Loan 898-TH and loans related to
the purchase of locomotives. The total debt outstanding at the end of 1977
is set forth in detail in Table 32 and summarized below:

Total                                      1,258
5.07      A detailed cash flow for 1974-76 is presented in Table 29.  As
shown, insufficient tariff relief over the period prevented SRT from making
a contribution to the investment program from its internal resources.
Similarly, aggregate net revenues in 1974-76 could only marginally contribute
to aggregate debt service. For SRT to have met, on average, the target rate
of return of 2% over the period, tariffs would have needed an additional
increase of about 22% commencing in fiscal 1974. Such an increase would
have allowed SRT to finance approximately 25% of the investment plan from
internal resources. The net revenues in 1977, enhanced by the fiscal 1976
tariff increase, covered debt service 1.2x.
C. Assumptions for Financial Projections
5.08      Freight tariffs will be increased by an average of 9.5% (Table 12)
as of January 1, 1979. However, if SRT is to achieve an adequate financial
position not later than fiscal 1980 as well as generate sufficient funds
internally to make a meaningful contribution to the 1977-81 Investment Plan,
further tariff increases are essential. The need for tariff increases is
reinforced by the requirement that revenues cover marginal costs on grounds of
sectoral efficiency. The tariff increases assumed by the Bank in developing
the financial forecasts are presented below:
Assumed tariff increases /a              Passenger        Freight
September 30, 1979                       15%             12%
September 30, 1980                        7%              7%
September 30, 1981                       5%              5%
/a Forecasts include effect of January 1979 tariff increase.
These tariff increases are meant to be illustrative of the order of magnitude
of rate adjustments which would be required to achieve the agreed annual
rates of return in 1980 and thereafter (para. 5.12). The above schedule of
tariffs is strongly dependent upon the traffic and working expense assumptions
discussed in para. 5.09. The resulting forecasts which provide a sound
financial profile are set forth in Tables 13, 29 and 31 and discussed in
paras. 5.10 -. 5.13.



- 32 -
5.09      The methodology, principal bases and other assumptions underlying
the forecasts are presented below:
(a) Income Accounts:
(i) Revenues: Passenger revenues are based on the Bank's passenger
traffic forecasts (Table 8). Freight revenue projections
are based on agreed commodity by commodity traffic forecasts
(Table 9). Revenues are computed by applying the average
1977 revenues per ton-km for each commodity and the average
1977 revenues per pass-km. Adjustments are made to include
the effect of the proposed tariff increases.
(ii) Working Expenses: Forecasts of working expenses are based on a
detailed costing exercise undertaken by SRT with consultative
assistance. The study separated major working expense categories
into fixed and traffic-dependent costs. Labor costs assume
that the staff level will remain unchanged throughout the
forecast period. The increase in working expenses in nominal
terms has been projected on the basis of an 8% annual inflation
in 1979-1982.
(iii)  Depreciation is calculated on original cost at 3.3% of the
annual value of gross assets, excluding land and rails.
The cost of rail replacements is charged to a renewal fund at
2.9% of original cost.
(iv)  Interest Charges were projected on the basis of: existing debt,
the new Bank loan at 7.35% p.a. (repayable over 20 years,
including 5 years grace) and two sources of foreign debt at 2%
p.a. and 7.5% p.a. to finance the purchase of locomotives
(repayable over 30 years, 10 years grace and 10 years, no grace
respectively).
(b) Balance Sheets
(i) Receivables are proportional to freight traffic;
(ii) Inventories which represented approximately two years of
"other materials" in 1977 expense are assumed to diminish
over the forecast period to 1.6 years of "other materials"
expense in 1981;



- 33 -
(iii) Accounts payable vary with working expenses; and
(iv) A minimum cash requirement of approximately one month of
working expenses plus debt service expenses is assumed.
(c) Cash Flow
The cash flow is based on the above assumptions together with the
schedule of annual Government funding presented in Table 29.
D. Forecast Financial Performance
5.10      The 1978-81 income account forecast is set forth in Table 13
and summarized below:
Estimated             Forecast
1978      1979       1980       1981
(Baht million)
Operating Revenues                1,601      1,780      2,119     2,352
Operating Expenses                1,518      1,753      1,931     2,113
Operating Surplus                    83         27        188        239
Interest Charge                      72         82         90         96
Interest Earned                      15         15         11         12
Net Revenue Surplus (Deficit)        26        (40)       109        155
Operating Ratio                      95         98         91         90
Times Interest Earned              1.2x       0.3x       2.1x       2.5x
Debt Service Coverage              1.1x       O.9x       1.7x       1.9x
The financiaL ratios which are marginal in 1978 are projected to weaken
measurably in 1979 due to an expected increase in salaries and wages of more
than 15%; thereafter, following the assumed schedule of tariff increases
(para. 5.08), the operating ratio would improve from 98 in 1979 to 90 by
1981; the interest coverage ratio would rise from 0.3x in 1979 to a satis-
factory 2.5x in 1981; and the debt service coverage ratio would strengthen
from 0.9x in 1979 to l.9x in 1981. SRT has reaffirmed Section 5.04 of the
Loan Agreement for Loan 898-TH, which requires SRT not to incur additional
debt if its met revenue is less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirements.



- 34 -
5.11      The estimated balance sheet summaries for 1979-81 are presented in
Table 31. The debt/equity ratio remains modest throughout the forecast
period. The scheduled investment of Government funds (Table 29) enables
the current ratio and liquid ratio to maintain ample levels in excess of 3.7x
and 1.lx respectively throughout the forecast period. Thus the forecast
current position is favorable, with working capital more than adequate to
finance current operations. The Government has agreed to supply sufficient
funds to enable the sum of SRT's cash balance and short-term deposits to be
greater than 8% of the prior year's combined working expenses and debt
service requirements.
5.12      The rates of return on SRT's average net fixed assets in use as
projected by the Bank are 0.4% in fiscal 1979, 2.5% in fiscal 1980, and 3.0%
in fiscal 1981. SRT has agreed, in light of its projections, that it shall
earn not less than 1% in fiscal 1979, 2.5% in fiscal 1980, and 3.0% thereafter.
For purposes of the rate of return computation, net fixed assets are to be
defined relative to the existing asset base as presently valued plus subsequent
additions. Following SRT's revaluation of assets (para. 2.35), the schedule
of required annual rates of return would be appropriately adjusted in a manner
agreeable to SRT and the Bank. The rate of return of 1% in fiscal 1979
represents a compromise between divergent viewpoints of SRT and the Bank.
While SRT is confident it will achieve a rate of return well in excess of
1%, the Bank, primarily due to its lower projections of passenger traffic
combined with its higher working expenses expectations, has forecasted only
0.4%. The resulting projected shortfall in achieving a 1% return in fiscal
1979 is less than 2.5% of expected revenues. The agreement on a 1% rate of
return in 1979 respects SRT's confidence in its capability to attract addi-
tional traffic and to limit expenses. Should SRT's projections prove optimis-
tic as fiscal 1979 evolves, SRT is committed to undertake all measures,
including the adjustment of tariffs, necessary to achieve the agreed 1% annual
rate of return in 1979. Also, to assist in attaining the target rates of
return, SRT has agreed to carry out an annual review of its tariffs commencing
in fiscal 1979 and to submit such reviews for the Bank's information and
comments. Further, the Government has reaffirmed Section 3.03 of the Guarantee
Agreement of Loan 898-TH, which requires it to take all necessary action to
set and maintain tariffs at appropriate levels. The agreed rates of return
reflect a balance between the Government's policy of inflation control and
SRT's requirement for an adequate cash flow (para. 5.13).
5.13      Overall, the projected cash position of SRT is healthy.  A detailed
cash flow for the 1977-1981 period is presented in Table 29 and summarized
below:

Increase in Working Capital                     303

Loans                                          1,022               37
Government Funds                              135                 40
2,785              100
According to the financing plan for 1977-81, SRT would be able to finance a
satisfactory 23% of its investment from internally generated funds. Most of
the net cash 'will be generated in the final two years of the Plan (Table 29)
as SRT's earning power improves; during the early years (fiscal 1977-79),
SRT will contribute only modestly (10%) to the 1977-79 investment cost and
will rely heavily on government funds (56%) and foreign borrowing (34%).
The adequacy of SRT's cash flow is based on the assumption that its capital
expenditures will not exceed the planned program. Accordingly, SRT has agreed
to limit its capital expenditures on items outside the Investment Plan to
within 20 million Baht annually.

E. Sensitivity Analysis and Financial Risks
5.14      The financial projections were tested for sensitivity to changes in
the values of these key variables: freight/passenger traffic, staff size,
inventory levels, and tariffs (timing and levels). The various alternatives
are defined below. In each of the alternatives, a single variable has
been altered from the base case assumptions with all other factors remaining
unchanged. The changes in the key variables examined do not represent
expected deviations from forecast levels and are used only for the purpose of
the sensitivity exercise.
Alternative 1: 50% reduction in freight traffic growth over the
1979-81 period;
Alternative 2: Passenger traffic is assumed to remain constant at
the 1978 level (base case assumption: 3% p.a. growth rate);
Alternative 3: Labor force growth rate of 1.0% p.a. in 1979-81
(base case assumption: staff level remains unchanged);
Alternative 4: Inventory levels rise from the 1977 level of about
two years to 2.5 years of "other materials" in 1981 (base case
assumption: steady decline to 1.6 years of "other materials" in
1981);
Alternative 5: Freight tariffs are not increased in fiscal 1980;
tariffs for fiscal 1981 are as presented in para. 5.08; passenger
tariffs are increased by 10% on September 30, 1979 (base case
assumption: freight tariff increase of 12%; passenger tariff
increase of 15%); and
Alternative 6: Six month delay in each year in effective date of
assumed tariff increases (para. 5.08).
The effect of these alternatives on cash requirements is illustrated in
tabular form below:

- 37 -
The foregoing analysis indicates that under Alternatives 1-3, SRT would still
be able to service debt and make a significant contribution to the Investment
Plan. However, expanding inventories as described in Alternative 4 could pose
an excessive drain on SRT's resources, reinforcing the need for SRT to control
inventory levels over the Plan period. Alternatives 5 and 6 emphasize the
importance of adequate tariff action.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Under agreements reached with the Bank at negotiations, SRT will,
inter alia:
(a)  in reaffirmation of Section 3.05(b) of the Loan Agreement of Loan
898-TH, make arrangements with the Government for adequate
compensation for operating uneconomic branch lines; and complete
the analysis of all uneconomic branch lines by the end of fiscal
1979 (paras. 2.36 and 2.37);
(b)  revalue its assets not later than March 31, 1980 and every four
yeairs thereafter (para. 2.35); and
(c)  take all required measures, including tariff adjustments, to earn
an annual return on net fixed assets of not less than 1% in fiscal
19793, 2.5% in fiscal 1980 and 3% thereafter (para. 5.12).
6.02      Undtsr agreements reached with the Bank at negotiations, the Govern-
ment will:
(a)  take all necessary measures under which SRT will be promptly
reimbursed for branch line losses (para. 2.36);
(b)  supply sufficient funds to allow the sum of SRT's cash balance and
short term deposits to be no less than 8% of the prior year's
combined working expenses and debt service requirements (para.
5.1L); and
(c)  enable SRT to meet its rate of return requirements (para. 5.12);
6.03      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$16.7 million equivalent
to SRT for a l:erm of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years.

FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Past Bank Group-Financed Transport Projects
1.01      The Bank Group has financed 13 previous transportation projects in
Thailand. Four loans have been for railways: 35-TH, signed in October 1950,
for US$3 million (First); 128-TH, signed in August 1955, for US$12 million
(Second); 280-TH, signed in April 1961, for US$22 million (Third) and 898-TH,
signed in June 1973, for US$15 million (Fourth). There have been three loans
for ports: 37-TH, signed in October 1950, for US$4.4 million (First); 151-TH,
signed in October 1956, for US$3.4 million (Second); and 702-TH, signed in
August 1970, for US$12.5 million (Third). The six highway loans were:
341-TH, signed in June 1963, for US$35 million, (First); 455-TH, signed in
June 1966, for US$36 million (Second); 535-TH, signed in May 1968, for US$29
million (Third); 626-TH, signed in June 1969,, for US$23 million (Fourth);
870-TH, signed in December 1972, for US$28.6 million (Fifth); and 1619-TH,
signed in March 1978, for US$110 million (Sixth).
1.02      All four railway projects were completed satisfactorily, but about
US$7.5 million of the loan amount for the Third Project was cancelled in
respect of equipment which the Borrower preferred to purchase through proced-
ures which did not conform to the Bank Group Guidelines. The first two port
projects were completed on schedule, and the third project was completed in
May 1976, over two years behind schedule largely because of delays in awarding
civil works contracts.
1.03      The first four highway projects were satisfactorily completed and
with substantial savings in cost compared with the estimates. In the case
of the First Highway Project about US$13.1 million of the loan amount was
cancelled at the Government's request when some road sections were removed
from the project. On the Second Highway Project US$4.9 million was cancelled
as most of the contingency allowances were not needed; however, the closing
date was extended 22 months as construction of some road sections and
detailed engineering of one road took longer than scheduled. On the Third
Highway Project US$6.1 million was cancelled as the bid prices were substan-
tially lower than estimated, probably because of intense competition among
contractors at the time; the closing date was extended by six months mainly
because of construction delay on one road section caused by flood. On the
Fourth Highway Project, US$6.2 million was cancelled, again because of low
bid prices and general price stability prior to the bidding and while most
of the construction was carried out; however, the closing date was extended
by 21 months to complete work on one road where construction conditions were
exceptionally difficult. On the Fifth Highway Project, the bid prices, and
contracts awarded in late 1971 through mid-1973, were in line with the cost
estimates. However, the sharp price rise for petroleum products in 1973-75,
accompanied by general inflation, led to disputes with the contractors and a
virtual stoppage of work over several months. The Government eventually
offered increased payments to partially offset higher costs of the alterna-
tive of terminating the contracts. The offer was accepted on three contracts,



- 39-                                  ANNEX 1
Page 2
while on four contracts the contractors elected to terminate. The remaining
two contracts had already been completed at that time. Rebidding produced
relatively little interest from foreign firms, and new contracts for the
uncompleted wor7-s were awarded to domestic firms, at approximately double
the original prices. As a result, there will be a cost overrun of about 30%
on the entire project. The project is now expected to be completed by about
mid-1979 with a delay of about 18 months. The Sixth Highway Project became
effective in June 1978, and construction works, the main project component,
are in progress on 8 of the 11 project roads.

Ia  According to SRT, each Alsthom locomotive hauled in 1977 on an average 65 million net ton-km, i.e. 19 locomotives
hauled 65 x 19 - 1,235 million net ton-km.
/b Excluding 10 work train locomotives, other diesel locomotives (44) hauled 1,435 (2,670 - 1,235) million net ton-km per annum; thus
on the average each locomotive hauled 1,435 t 44 - 32.7 million net ton-km per annum; 3 Hitachi hauled 3 x 32.7 - 98 million net
ton-km per annum; 41 other locomotives hauled 41 x 32.7 - 1,340 million net ton-km per annum.
/c Most of the new 1,800 hp locomotives will be used on assignments, which will not permit formation of long-distance block trains.
An annual output of 50 million net ton-km per locomotive has therefore been assumed in this calculation.
/d 22 new locomotives in service require 26 locomotives in fleet (22 - 0.85 (availability ratio)].
