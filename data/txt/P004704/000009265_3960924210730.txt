PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report presents a performance
evaluation of the Thailand Fifth Railway Project, for which
Loan 1662-TH for US$16.7 million was approved in 1979. This report
has been prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region and focuses
mainly on the Bank-financed components of the project.
The PCR is based on data and information supplied by the
State Railway of Thailand and on Bank supervision mission reports.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.  The
draft Completion Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however,
none were received.

FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1662-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        The Fifth Railway Project was a natural sequel to the Fourth Railway
Project for which the Bank made a laan of US$15 million (Loan 898-TH) in
1973. Loan 1662-TH for US$16.7 million was signed in 1979. The Fourth and
Fifth Projects finan.ed, respectively, time slices of SRT's 1972-76 and
1977-81 investment plans.
ii.       The main objective of the Fifth Project was to assist the State
Railway of Thailand in improving operational efficiency by replacing obsolete
and worn-out assets and in expanding capacity to serve projected traffic
needs.
iii.        :al investments under SRT's 1977-81 Investment Plan were estimated
to exceed oaht 2.0 billion (US$100 million). Of this, the Bank loan provided
$16.7 million (US $0.6 million was cancellad), the balance of the funds coming
from USAID, OECF, Government and commercial banks in France and Germany, and
Government and commercial banks in Thailand.
iv.       The project was substantially completed by December 31, 1983, after
a two-year delay; the original closiixg date was December 31, 1981. The final
project cost was US$98.6 million compared with the appraisal estimate of about
US$100 million. The cost saving was due mainly to a portion of the track
rehabilitation work not being completed due to inadequate supply of sleepers
and the devaluation of the Baht which reduced the dollar cost of local
expenditures.
v.        SRT's passenger traffic exceeded appraisal forecasts, but freight
traffic declined instead of growing and was 23% below the forecast in 1981.
vi.       SRT's operational performance was reflected in the financial per-
formance, with the operating loss growing from B 38 million in 1979 to B 413
million in 1981.
vii.      SRT found it difficult to comply with most of the financial cove-
nants in view of the operational and financial situation it found itself in
and in the face of lack of Government support even in such matters as closure
of uneconomic lines, prompt payment of subsidies for uneconomic services, and
so on.
viii.          Experience under the Fifth Railway Project confirms that suc-
cess in achieving the policy objectives of any project depends entirely on the
government's commitment to those objectives. While the physical parts of this
project were eventually satisfactorily completed, the Government of Thailand
is only recently evincing interest in pursuing the overall policy changes that
were central to its success.

FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1662-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Over the last two decades, Thailand's transport network has been
transformed from a primarily rail and river-based one to a primarily road-
based system. Nevertheless, rail and river transport continue to be important
because of their relative advantage for the movement of freight in bulk and in
substantial volumes. The Fifth Railway Project was designed to help finance
the last three years of the 1977-81 Investment Plan of the State Railway of
Thailand (SRT) and thereby (i) help to improve SRT's operational efficiency by
replacing worn-out and obsolete assets, and (ii) assist SRT in expanding
traffic carrying capacity to meet anticipated traffic growth. A secondary but
very important objective of the project was to introduce a commercial approach
to SRT's operations.
1.02      The Bank has made four previous loans to SRT for a total of
US$52 million. Loan 898-TH for US$15 million was the fourth in the series and
was approved in June 1973. All four projects were completed satisfactorily,
although a sum of US$7.5 million of the Third Loan was cancelled as SRT's
procurement procedures for some equipment did not conform to Bank guidelines.
1.03      This is the completion report on the Fifth Railway Project financed
by Loan 1662-TH for US$16.7 million equivalent. The loan was approved on
February 22, 1979, and the agreement signed on April 23, 1979. It became
effective on August 27, 1979. Cofinancing was provided by bilateral agencies
and local currency financing by SRT and the Government.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
A. Origin of Project
2.01      The Fifth Railway Project was basically a three-year (1979-81) time
slice of the 1977-81 five-year Investment Plan of SRT. The 1977-81 Plan was a
follow-on of SRT's 1972-76 Investment Plan which sought to achieve the com-
plete dieselization of the locomotive fleet and expand capacity to meet
traffic needs; these objectives were largely realized. The 1977-81 Plan was
carefully drawn up by SRT with the aim of further improving operational effi-
ciency and was jointly scrutinized by SRT and Bank staff during appraisal.
Some modifications were subsequently made (before Board presentation) to take
account of proposed changes in SRT's tariff policy and its impact on projected
traffic.



- 2-
B.   Pro3ect Scope and Content
2.02      The project as finally agreed consisted of the last three yearx of
BRT's 1977-81 investment plan and included:
(a) acquisition ofs
(i) 30 diesel-electric locomotives of 1,800 hp each, including
spare parts and tools, and
(ii) track maintenance equipment, telecommunications and signalling
equipment, and machinery and equipment for rolling stock
maintenance;
(b) manufacture of about 90 passenger coaches and about 100 freight
cars;
(c) a program of track and bridge rehabilitation, including renewal of
about 650 km of rails, with new and reconditioned rail, welding rail
joints on 270 km of track with continuous rail between stations,
acquisition and installation of about 240,000 concrete sleepers, and
rebuilding of about 120 wooden and 60 steel bridges;
(d) modernizing of telecomunmicationo and signalling systems, replacing
old with modern, more efficient equipment;
(e) rebuilding of the locomotive overhaul shed at Makkasan and provision
of facilities and equipment at Makkasan and district workshops; and
(f)  miscellaneous items, such as level crossing barriers, staff housing,
offices, siding extensions etc.
2.03      As part of the project, SRT was to:
(a) complete an analysis of the financial losses incurred on the
operation of each of the uneconomic branch lines;
(b) forward to the Bank a study carried out by NESDB!1 relating to
uneconomic branch lines, including recommendation of alternative
methods of providing the services; and
(c) carry out a profitability study of its services, for review and
comment by the Bank, and subsequent implementation of mutually
agreed measures to improve profitability.

2.04      SRT was responsible for implementing the project, including the
manufacture of rolling stock in its workshops, using imported materials.
Concrete sleepers would be manufactured by local contractors. The loan
agreement included operational targets to be achieved over the years 1979-
1981. The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1981.
10          III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A.   Execution of the Project
3.01      While a substantial part of the project was carried out in time, the
completion of some major works was delayed till FY82, or even later in some
cases; for example, manufacture of passenger cars, rail renewal, laying of
concrete sleepers and replacement of steel bridges. At the end of FY81
expenditure on the project amounted to only 65% of total estimated cost.
3.02      The main reason for the delay was tho slow progress in procurement
of material and equipment. In particular, for Bank financed items: (a) the
preparation of tender documents took up to 11 months longer than estimated;
(b) the bid evaluation, which in many cases involved requests for further
information from bidders, took from three to five months; and (c) due to the
complicated and time-consuming procedures for contract award, there was a
lapse of up to ten months from the Bank's approval of awards to signing of
contracts.  Although under Section 4.02(c) of the Loan Agreement SRT was to
effect improvements to procurement procedures, little was achieved in this
respect. As a result, the loan closing date was exteuded from the original
December 31, 1981, to December 31, 1983.
3.03      Implementation was good in areas where materials were in stock (for
manufacture of some passenger coaches and freight cars), or on diesel
locomotives, where negotiations for purchase of 30 Alsthom (French) units were
in progress at appraisal, or on part of the rail renewal program, using rail
being provided with government funds.
3.04      The most serious delays occurred in:
(a) acquisition and installation of concrete sleepers due to procurement
and design problems. There was delay in the purchase of monoblock
sleepers costing about B 90 million when the lowest bidder withdrew,
and deliveries were not completed until January 1984;
(b) track and bridge rehabilitation, due to delays in procurement of
steel for bridges and rail; and
(c) manufacture of passenger coaches using parts and materials financed
by the loan, due to slow procurement.
3.05      Specific items uncompleted by the end of the original project
completion date were as follows:

3.06      Mechanized track maintenance equipment (costing about US$3.2 million
equivalent), included late in the project in order to utilize unspent loan
funds, was not shipped until October-November 1983. Similarly, some signal-
ling equipment, costing about US$400,000 equivalent, was not shipped until
October/November 1983, and of the two overhead cranes needed for the Makassan
workshops, one was shipped in January 1982, the other in March 1983. Table 1
gives detailed physical progress of the project as of the end of 1983, the
extended loan closing date, compared with the appraisal expectations.
3.07      A major investment item outside the project was the construction of
the Chachoengaao-Sattahip line, on which B 1,365 million was spent over the
period 1979-83, with funding from the Government (part of the B 2,380 million
noted in para. 5.19).
B.   Costs and Disbursement
3.08      The cost estimate of the project at appraisal, ard the final project
costs, are summarized below.  Details are given ir, Table ^.

The above figures (and those of Table 2) have been built up from data provided
by SRT, with some amendments in the 'ighi of further explanations from SRT.
Data originally provided for a major item, track rehabilitation, produced
unduly low cost figures, due largely to SRT's method of accounting for rail
replacement. SRT's practice is to regard rail replacement as a maintenance
cost, except to the extent that the new rail is better (for instance, of
greater weight). In this case, SRT calculates the betterment element of cost,
which is added to the relevant fixed asset account.  The remaining, and much
larger, cost element is charged to maintenance. The project cost calculations
have been, accordingly, amended to include this cost. In addition, costs of
such items as tre-k maintenance equipment, signalling equipment, and
acquisition and laying of concrete sleepers, much of which occurred after
1983, have been added. The costs of some items, for which the data has been
unavailable, have been estimated from other available data.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A.   Passengers
4.01      The appraisal report forecast that, over the project pe 'od,
passenger traffic would increase at about 3-4.5% p.a. systemwide.-   Actually,
from 1979 to 1983, the number of passengers grew by 6% annually, and pass-km
by 8.9% annually, despite a drop in the last quarter of FY81 due to a 35%
railway fare increase in June 1981. The average passenger journey increased
from 109 km. to 119 km. Thus the forecasts for passenger traffic were easily
surpassed. Table 3 gives details of annual passenger traffic.
B.   Freight
4.02      At appraisal it was expected that SRT's freight traffic would expand
at about 6.5% p.a. in tons and 4.7% p.a. in ton-km. In fact, freight traffic
declined over the period 1979-83, with tonnage falling by 4% p.a. and ton-km
by 2.9% p.a. By 1981, actual tonnage was 23% under the forecast and ton-km
22% under the forecast.  Average haul, per ton, rose slightly, from 441 kr. to
466 km.



4.03      From the details given in Tables 4 and 5, it will be seen that the
decline since 1978 was generally widespread over most commodities carried by
SRT, with only gypsum, rice, maize, containers, rubber and coconut showing
modest increases. Container traffic reached the forecast level by 1983.
4.04      SRT's explanation for the poor freight business is that the large
increase in passenger traffic (due mainly to the extremely low fares charged
by SRT), required the use of more locomotives, and consequently the freight
traffic could not always get the motive power it needed. The problem was com-
pounded by a general shortage of motive power during peak periods, due to
mechanical problems, and many freight trains got cancelled. This did not
improve SRT's ability to compete for and attract freight traffic. There was
also a sharp drop in traffic after June 1981, when freight tariffs were raised
by 73% on average. (There were some reductions subsequently, bringing the
tariff increase to 59%, but this helped SRT only marginally).
C.   Operations
4.05      Certain operational targets to be achieved over the years 1977-81
were given in Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement. These are detailed in
Table 6, together with the actual achievements over the period FY79-83.
4.06      Availability of main line diesel locomotives (1,800 hp), while not
reaching the 1979 and 198Q targets, exceeded the target in 1981 and subse-
quently in 1982 and 1983.-'  For the remaining main-line diesel locomotives,
the availability targets were not achieved, although an improvement was noted
in 1983. Availability targets for diesel rail cars were in general achieved,
but targets for passenger and freight cars were not achieved. SRT performed
well in reducing freight car turnaround time, exceeding the targets each year.
4.07      Although at appraisal SRT expressed its "aim of reducing major
locomotive overhaul time from 23 to 18 days," this objective was not achieved,
due, according to SRT, to the following factors:
the working area at Makkasan workshop is insufficient,
--   delayed procurement of spares,
--   unit replacement could not adequately be performed, and
--   the heavy incidence of unscheduled and accident repairs sent to this
workshop.
Any future project should address these problems.
2/   4.5% p.a. for 1978-79, and 3% p.a. for 1979-81.
3/   The arrival of 30 new locomotives by the end of 1981 contributed to
higher availability.



- 8 -
4.08      As part of the project, SRT has improved and expanded its
commercial/marketing operations, so as to attract more traffic. By the end of
the project period, the staff of the marketing department (created in 1975)
totalled 74.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Revenues and Expenses
5.01      While SRT's total operating revenues exceeded the appraisal fore-
casts in each year of the project, operating costs rose sharply in 1980 and in
1981, with further steady annual increases thereafter. In consequence,
operating deficits were incurred in each of the years 1979-83, and the agreed
financial rates of return were not achieved. There was a slight improvement
in FY82 and FY83 due to the freight and passenger tariff increases of June
1981. Detailed income statements are provided in Table 7 and are summarized
below:

5.02      Due to passenger traffic rising faster than expected, passenger
revenues were higher than forecast in each year, with the 1981 total of
B 1,545 million being 27% above the forecast for that year.  A fare increase
of about 35% (see para. 5.09) in June 1981 helped boost passenger revenues,
particularly in subsequent years.
5.03      As noted in para 4.02, freight traffic steadily declined each year
(except that total ton-km increased slightly in 1980), thus lowering reve-
nues. However, the tariff increases in June 1981 (para. 4.04) enabled freight
revenues to grow in that year, and even more so in 1982, although they fell in
1983.



- 9 -
5.04      The increases in operating costs were largely the result of:
(a) labor cost, which, even though staff numbers remained relatively
stable, rose at an annual rate of 15% over the period, with the
average cost per employee increasing by 75% between 1979 and 1983;
(b) fuel cost, which more than doubled in FY80 and increased by more
than 20X in FY81 (an annual rate of 25Z from 1979 to 1983); and
(c) other material costs which rose by about 85% over the period due to
world inflation.
5.05      The above unsatisfactory results would have been even 4yorse, had SRT
complied with the intent of Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement - and charged
depreciation calculated on revalued fixed assets. Although a revaluation was
carried out in 1980, the results were not reflected in SRT's accounts, because
the regulations of the Ministry of Finance relating to accounting and finances
of State enterprises (B.E. 2520) prohibited the inclusion of asset revaluation
data in published (i.e., official) accounts, unless agreement is reached with
the Ministry of Finance. Thus annual depreciation charges continued to be
calculated on the book values, and the real losses undlerstated.
5.06      The asset revaluation done by SRT in FY80 was based on the rise in
wholesale price indices (in Thailand for locally procured assets, and in
countries from where assets had been procured), using asset book values of
1968 as the base. Bank staff disagreed with this methodology, on the grounds
that the increase in the prices of rolling stock (locomotives and passenger
and freight cars) in particular far exceeded the general inflation in the
countries of procurement. A more reliable estimate of current asset values
was made by Bank staff, and annual depreciation charges recalculated on this
basis are incorporated in the following revised operating results for the
period FY79-82:
4/   Section 5.05 required SRT to revalue its fixed assets no later than
March 31, 1980.

5.07      The detailed operating revenue and expenditure figures of FY83, as
given in Table 7, have been deflated to the FY79 level using an averege of the
official wholesale and consumer price movements over that period, as shown
below (in million Baht):

/a   Also adjusted for traffic.
5.08      The above shows that, using the same traffic levels and despite the
1981 tariff increase, passenger revenues declined by 19%, in real terms, and
freight revenues by 6%. Staff costs increased by 4% and fuel cost by 40%,
with other material and service costs rising by 6%. Provision for
depreciation declined in real terms by 26%.
B.   Tariffs and Costs
5.09      Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement required SRT to take such action
(including adjustments to the level of its tariffs) as would be required to
reach the agreed financial targets. With the rise in costs noted in
para. 5.04, tariff increases became urgently necessary, not only to enable SRT
to reach its financial targets, but also to help it generate sufficient
revenues to preserve its working capital and general financial condition.
5.10      However, while requests for increases in standard tariffs were made
by SRT, and supported by the Bank, government approval was slow in coming.
Although Section 39 of the State Railway of Thailand Act of 1975 vests the
authority for certain standard rate variations in SRT's Board of Commis-
sioners, in practice all such tariff changes require the approval of not only
the Board of Commissioners but also the Minister of Communications, various
government agencies and the Cabinet. This procedure necessarily takes time,
and tariffs were not revised substantially until June 1981, except for an 8.9%
increase in freight rates in e&rly February 1979, and increases of 30% (July
1979) and of 20% (February 1980) in rates for bulk petroleum products.



- 12 -
However, SRT can negotiate rates with individual shippers, so that now (in
1985) most of its freight traffic is being carried at special and contract
rates.
5.11      The new tariffs raised standard 5/ first class passenger fares by
552, second class by 44X and third class by 322, giving a weighted average
in6 ease of 352.  For freight traffic, the standard rates for classes 3 and
4 - were raised on average 50-150X and 40-200X respectively, with the
increase being higher with distance. The rates for petroleum were increased
by only about 13%. Rates for special trains, charged at negotiated rates,
were also renegotiated upwards. The resulting effective rate incr3ase,
weighted iy traffic volumes (ton-km), was 732, on average.  Subsequent to the
formal rate increases, however, a variety of rebates in the range of 5-29X
were granted to counter the effect of such a high freight rate increase,
which, it was feared, would result in decline in freight traffic. Some
concessions were also made in passenger fares. As a result of these rebates,
the effective increase became 312 in passenger fares and 592 in freight rates.
5.12      SRT calculates long-run variable costs (LRVC) on its passenger and
freight traffic. However, despite the asset revaluation of FY80, depreciation
charges were not adjusted to reflect the resulting increased asset values. As
a result, the LRVC's as presently calculated by SRT are considerably under-
stated. In FY80, average revenues were B 0.149 per passenger km and B 0.262
per ton-km, compared with LRVC's of B 0.145 per pass-km and B 0.291 per ton-
km. Thus even by SRT's own calculations, which are based on unrevalued
assets, freight was carried at revenues considerably below LRVC, while passen-
gers were carried only marginally above LRVC - a margin quite insufficient to
contribute much towards fixed costs. Restating the costs, using depreciation
calculated on revalued assets, indicates that both passengers and freight were
carriec at substantially below their LRVC's.
5.13      The June 1981 tariff increase improved the relationship between
revenues and costs, and most of the traffic items produced revenues at least
marginally above LRVC's based on revalued assets. However, these revenues
were still far below those required to cover fixed costs, as shown in the
following table, using values f3y depreciation that reflect estimated replace-
ment costs of assets (in FY81):-
5/   Considerable discounts are given to commuters, armed forces veterans,
students, etc.
6/   Classes 1 and 2 cover dangerous goods and less than carload (L.C.L.)
traffic.
7/   LRVC calculations for 1983 are:  passengers B 0.201 per pass-km, and
freight B 0.444 per ton-km.

To narrow the gap between revenues and costs, among other measures, some
further tariff increases, to take into account the increase in costs due to
inflation, are necessary at regular intervals over the next few years.
5.14      Under Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement, SRT undertook to carry
out, by December 31, 1979, a profitability study of its services, and, after
review by the Bank, promptly implement such measures as would be deemed
mutually appropriate by SRT and the Bank. A copy of the study was sent to the
Bank on June 3, 1980. There was no meaningful dialogue between SRT and the Bank
on the specific recommendations of the study. However, SRT later informed the
Bank that the results of the study have been used for: tariff adjustments
(both standard and special), selection of more profitable services in cases of
inadequate rail capacity, planning of services, rolling stock procurement, and
planning of increased efficiency and/or reduction in costs on less profitable
services.
C.   Uneconomic Lines and Services
5.15      As of mid-1978, SRT operated eight branch lines with a total length
of 630 km, which had been identified as unprofitable and requiring specific
Government compensation for the losses incurred on their operation.
Section 3.05 of the Loan Agreement required SRT to:
(a) submit to the Bank its analysis of the financial losses incurred as
a result of the operation of each of these uneconomic lines;
(b) forward to the Bank for review the study carried out by NESDB
relating to uneconomic branch lines, with NESDB's recommendations
with respect thereto; and
(c) unless and until these lines were discontinued, maintain with the
Government appropriate and satisfactory arrangements for reimburse-
ment of such losses.



- 14 -
5.16      The analysis under (a) above and the NESDB study were forwarded to
the Bank on time. In connection with the latter study, the Ministry of
Communications had concluded that three branch lines--Hat Yai-Songkla, Ban
Dara junction - Sawankhalok, and Wongwian Yai-Mae Klong--should be closed
down.
5.17      The NESDB in turn stated that only the first two of the above lines
should be closed, and action on the third suspended until further studies had
been carried out. The Cabinet approved the NESDB recommendation. However,
subsequently a subcommittee of WESDB made another study, and it concluded that
only the first two lines plus three others should be closed. However, the
Cabinet decided that only the first two lines should be closed, and compensa-
tion paid to SRT for losses on the other lines. The question of prompt
payment of the compensation for such losses by the Government was not resolved
(see para. 5.18).
D.   Financial Situation
(a) Flow of Funds
5.18      The Government provides funds to SRT:
(a) as compensation for specific losses incurred on providing uneconomic
passenger services;
(b) as a subsidy to offset SRT's annual operating deficits;l/ and
(c) as a contribution to equity to finance investments.
SRT experiences some delays in actually receiving items (a) and (b) 91bove
(para. 5.21). For instance, the record for item (b) is as followss-
8/   This includes depreciation, loan interest, foreign exchange adjustments,
rents, and profits/losses on sale of properties.
9/   1977 is omitted as SRT earned a profit that year.

As SRT could not provide any funds from its own resources (and indeed required
funds to support its operations), all funds for investment and debt service
had to come from the Government or from further borrowing. In late 1983, the
Government transferred B 481 million to SRT's account at the Bank of Thailand,
thus improving its bank balance, and enabling SRT to reduce its bank
overdraft.

(ii) Balance Sheets
5.20      Detailed balance sheets (actual and forecast) for the years 1979-83
are given in Table 8. The current and liquid ratios, which were quite satis-
factory at 3.5 and 1.6 times in 1979, had deteriorated to 1.1 and a very
unsatisfactory 0.2 respectively by 1982, improving slightly to 1.5 and 0.6 in
1983, due to the above-mentioned infusion of cash by the Government. While
current assets increased by 40% from B 1,189 million in 1979 to B 1,594 mil-
lion in 1983 (largely due to an increase of B 290 million in inventories),
current liabilities have tripled, from B 335 million to B 1,076 million.
5.21      Long-term debt declined Zrom B 1,506 million in 1979 to B 1,237 mil-
lion in 1982, increasing slightly to B 1,253 million in 1983. The debt/equity
ratio, at 18/82 in 1983, down from 21/79 in 1981 and 1982, is reasonable.
Short-term loans, in the amount of B 100 million, were obtained in 1983, and
SRT also had a bank overdraft of B 252 million in 1982 and B 237 million in
1983. This was despite the requirement of (a) para. 3.03 of the Guarantee
Agreement that the Guarantor should provide SRT with such funds as would
enable it to maintain cash and short-term deposits totalling not less than 8%
of its annual combined working expenses and debt service requirements, and
(b) para. 3.04 which specifies measures to ensure prompt reimbursement of
annual operating deficits.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01      SRT undertook an economic evaluation of the project as completed,
analyzing it by its principal components. The results of its evaluation are
summarized below:
(i)   Rolling stock
- Passenger coaches                                       -7
- Wagons
(ii)   Track maintenance equipment                                 32
(iii)   Concrete sleepers                                           12
(iv)   Strengthening of bridges                                    31
(v)   Semi-automatic brake block casting plant                    50
6.02      The approach taken by SRT in evaluating investments in rolling stock
was based on comparing costs with revenues from their use. But as explained
in Section IV, tariffs were not adjusted to reflect cost increases
periodically or adequately, ai.d therefore, this approach in this particular
instance is not valid. A comparison with alternative road transport costs
indicates that this investment will have a positive return for passenger
coaches (and locomotives), as passenger traffic grew substantially between
1977 and 1983; the return is estimated at 11%. On the other hand, freight
traffic declined during the period, partly because of SRT's policy of giving
priority to passenger traffic, and the investments in wagon purchases are not
likely to yield any economic return.



- 17 -
6.03      The overall return on the whole project, including portions of the
project for which the economic return could not be calculated, is now estima-
ted at 102, compared with the appraisal estimate of 17X.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      SRT was set up in 1951 as a separate organization under the State
Railway of Thailand Act to take over the functions of the Railway Department
of the Ministry of Communications. A Board of Commissioners appointed by the
Council of Ministers formulates policy and oversees SRT management. However,
a 1959 amendment gave veto power to the Minister of Communications over any
action by SRT deemed inconsistent with Government policy. Although this power
appears to have been rarely used, it has effectively prevented SRT from becom-
ing a commercially-oriented, financially viable organization.
7.02      Under the Fifth Railway Project, the Bank initiated an attempt to
strengthen SRT as an organization (see paras. 2.03 and 5.15), but this did not
improve the situation very much and SRT continued to be highly dependent on
the Government for subsidies (which were usually paid 2-3 years late) and for
approval of tariff changes and service closures. The Bank, however, acted as
a moderating influence in substantially scaling down the ambitious plans of
the Government and SRT for further large-scale investments under SRT's 1972-86
Investment Plan from B 22 billion to under B 10 billion.
7.03      Experience under the Fifth Railway Project confirms that success in
achieving the policy objectives of any project depends entirely on the
government's commitment to those objectives. While the physical parts of this
project were eventually satisfactorily completed,the Government of Thailand is
only recently evincing interest in pursuing the overall policy changes that
were central to its success.
