BHAIRAWA LUMBINI GRO'JNDWATER II PROJECT
(Cr. 1316-NEP)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) for the Bhairawa Lumbini
Groundwater Project, Stage Ii, for which a Credit of SDR 15.1 million (US$16.0
million equivalent) was extended to His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN)
in March 1983. The Credit was closed on October 31, 1990 after two extensions
of the closing date. The Credit was fully disbursed by March 13, 1991.
Several implementation constraints encountered under this project are being
addressed in the follow-on project, Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation
III Project (Credit 2144-NEP).
Information sources used for the preparation of this PCR include: the
Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 4038-NEP), the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, quarterly prog.ess reports as submitted by the
Borrower, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower and internal memoranda.
Parts I and III of this PCR were sent to the Borrower for review and comments.
IDA received the Borrower's comments in late-1990 and incorporated them in the
PCR. The Borrower contributed Part II of the report.
No specific field trip was made to collect information for the PCR.
The PCR was prepared by staff of the Agricultural Division, Asia Technical
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
BHAIRAWA LUMBINI GROUNDWATER II PROJECT
(Cr. 1316-NEP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
i.       Objectives.  The Bhairawa I.umbini Groundwater Project (Stage II) was
to: (i) ensure that the existing tubewell systems developed under Stage I
(Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Project - Cr. 654-NEP) would be properly
operated and maintained in accordance with sound engineering standards; (ii)
introduce improved tubewell irrigation systems on a pilot basis in the Stage
II area; (iii) promote the participation of farmers in the project; 'iv)
ensure the provision of adequate inp.ts and extension services to farmers; and
(v) strengthen the instit:'tions responsible for the planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenanc'  (O&M) of tubewell irrigation systems.
ii.      Implementation.  The project made k  good start and proceeded smoothly
without major issue in the early stage ot :- lementation.  The project
accomplihhed most of the physical construct.on works specified in the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR).  All 64 tubewell irrigation systems developed under
Stage I are operating satisfactorily and supplying irrigation water reliably.
The operation of 16 tubewell irrigation systems developed with new technology
has been delayed due to failure by the contractot to install electrical
systems to the wells. However, it has been proved that the two new tubewell
systems tested for their operation with artisan flow were highly successful.
Farmer participation in the project was remarkable following the success of
reliable irrigation water supply under the project. It was evident that
farmers constructed field channels and drains by themselves, and supervised
the local contractor during construction of the main delivery systems. A
continuous devaluation of the Nepalese Rupees (NRs) against the US dollar
(from NRa 13.2 at appraisal to NRs 20.0 by mid-1986) resulted in a
considerable balance of unutilized funds. The project was revised to add the
construction of 22 new deep tubewell (DTW) systems using the balance of funds
in the Credit. However, delays were caused by: (a) HMGN's inefficient
management of the project's Special Account (SA), imposing internal
restrictions on availability of funds; (b) a trade and transit impasse with
India, restricting crucial supplies (fuels and spare parts) needed for
construction; and (c) insufficient annual budget allocation by HMGN,
restricting timely procurement of goods and services. To allow for completion
of the construction works, the Credit closing date was extended twice for a
total of two years to October 31, 1990. The works carried out were of high
standard. Of the 22 DTWs added, 17 have been drilled and tested. The
remaining works will be carried out under the Stage III project
(Cr. 2144-NEP).



- iv -
4ii.     Results.  No new DTW systems under Stage II were fully operational at
the Credit closing due to delay in installing electrical systems. However,
the power was expected to be connected to all tubewells by the end of February
1991 (see para. 8). There are strong indications that the Stage II area will
achieve higher benefits than the Stage I area because new DTW systems: (a) are
designed and constructed for timeliness and reliability of irrigation water
supply with new technology; and (b) have simpler O&M than Stage I irrigation
systems. In the Stage I project area, average cropping intensities increased
by 662, and yields of paddy and wheat increased by 111Z and 145?,
respectively, between 1982 (at the time of appraisal) and 1990. Yields of
other cereal and oil crops all exceeded appraisal projections. With a
reliable water supply, the project farmers started growing high-val: off
season vegetables and potatoes.  Programs designed to train farmers ±r op;   I
cultivation practices (para. 11) were instituted under the project, and
contributed to large increases in agLicultural production (para. 14). The
appraisal estimate of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for new tubewells was
122. The ERR has been re-estimated at 15?.
iv.      Sustainability.  The achievements of the project have had a
substantial positive impact on agricultural development in the project area
(para. 13). The following factors will contribute to maintaining an
acceptable level of benefits throughout the project's economic life: (a) the
organization of effective and functional water users' groups (WUGs) which will
facilitate sustained project O&M under overall public sector management with
increased users involvement (para. 19a); (b) the reliable and timely supply of
irrigation water w'nich will ensure farmers' confidence in farming, promote
incentives to grow high-value crops, and maximize utilization of farm lands
(paras. 8 and 13); and (c) the adoption of improved farming technology (para.
11). No major risk factors have been identified (para. 12).
v.       Findings and Lessons.  The project was successful.  Except for the
construction of 22 DTWs added during implementation (para. 10), the project
achieved all physical works envisaged at appraisal (Table 4). It demonstrated
the strong development impact of reliable irrigation supplies, combined with
electrification and access roads which were necessary adjunct components of
the project. In addition to the project's success, however, there were the
following weaknesses that were identified during project implementation:
(a) Considerable delay took place in implementation, especially in timely
procurement of essential goods and services, because of HMGN's
inefficient operation of the SA, which was often counter-productivi to
project interests (para. 9a);
(b) The Bank insisted, tanrealistically, that HMGN submit accounts and
audit reports within six months after the close of each fiscal year
(para. 19b); and
(c) The Development Credit Agreement made an unnecessary stipulation that
forced farmers to construct field channels and drains (para. 19b).



A lesson learned from the project is that it was difficult to organize
effective WUGs, and to persuade farmers to become involved in the project
cycle from an early stage. Once a reliable and adequate supply of irrigation
water "eras secured, and the economic incentive of increased production through
irrig.rion was demonstrated, the formation of WUGs and the construction of
iield channels and drains progressed rapidly. The lessons derived from the
experience have been incorporated in the formulation of thie follow-on Stage
III ;w-Ject, Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation III (Cr. 2144-NEP).

Background
1.       At the time of appraisal in 1982, agriculture accounted for 602 of
Nepal's gross domestic product and provided employment to over 902 of the
labor force. Only about one six-.h of the total land area was under
cultivation, of which about 15% was irrigated. About 901 of the cropped area
was in foodgrains, with rice accounting for about 501 of the total cropped
area. Other foodgrains which have been grown in substantial amounts include
maize, wheat, other cereals, and pulses. With increases in crop production
(1.1? per annum) offset by populdtion growth (2.61 per annum), per capita food
production had stagnated.
2.       In the late 1970s, the strategy of His Majesty's Government of Nepal
(HMGN) was to develop the Terai for generation of domestic and exportable
foodgrain surpluses as a resource to further development. Since possibilities
for area expansion are limited in the Terai, emphasis was given to increasing
yields, mainly by expansion and upgrading of existing irrigation
infrastructure and inputs. Initial results from the first IDA-assisted
irrigation project in Nepal - the Birganj Irrigation Project (Narayani Zone)
(Stage I - Cr. 373-NEP) - indicated that substantial yield improvements could
be expected from improved irrigation water supply combined with increased
agricultural inputs and effective extension services. HMGN's strategy
stressed diversification into cash crops whose performance had been promising
and whose market prospects were good.
3.       The Bank Group's strategy in Nepal placed major emphasis upon the
directly-productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development of
complementary infrastructure. Since IDA's first involvement with irrigation
in Nepal in 1973, there has been continuous IDA assistance to the irrigation
subsector (Table 1). The main objective of IDA involvement in irrigation in
the Terai was to improve the reliability of water distribution to the farm
through both technical improvements in the distribution system, better
operation and maintenance (O&M), and more effective organization of water
users based on the existing tradition of cooperation.

4.       The project w's the second phase of the expansion of the tubewell
facilities for irrigation in the western region of Nepal. The project was
prepared for IDA financing during late-1981 through early-1982 by an
international consulting firm. The project was appraised in February/March
1982. Tke Staff Appraisal Report (EAR) estimated total project costs at
US$19.4 million equivalent. Negotiations were held in Washington, DC during
the period November 29 - December 3, 1982. The IT)A Credit (1316-NEP) in the
amount of SDR 15.1 million (US$16.0 million equivalent) was approved by the
Board on January 18, 1983. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed
on March 16, 1983 and the Credit became effective on May 25, 1983.  The
project was scheduled to have a five-year implementation period, with a
completion date of October 31, 1987.
ProJect Oblectives and Description
5.       Objectives.  The objectives of the project were to:
(a) ensure that the existing 64 tubewell systems developed under Stage I
would be properly operated and maintained;
(b) introduce improved deep tubewell (DTW) irrigation systems on a pilot
basis over an area of 1,900 ha;
(c) promote the participation of farmers in the project from the early
stage;
(d) ensure the provision of production inputs to farmers and intensify
agricultural extension services and training; and
(e) strengthen the institutions responsible for O&M of tubewell
irrigation systems,
6.       Description.  The project components were:
(a) construction of:
(i)  distribution networks (280 km) and drainage system (62 km);
(ii)  about 500 km of field channels to convey irrigation supplies;
(iii)   96    of village roads in Stage I area and 25 km in the Stage II
(iv)      tt 80 km of power transmission lines in Stage I area and about
zm with transformers in Stage II area; and
(v)   five inputs storages (100-ton capacity each) and housing for
extension staff;
(b) planning, design, installation and operation of 16 new DTW schemes with
improved technology and buried pipeline distribution systems;
(c) procurement of materials, equipment and vehicles for construction,
extension activities, and project O&M;

(d) strengthening of agricultural extension and training;
(e) provision of agricultural production inputs to selected farmers;
(f) provision of techniLAl services, including foreign and local
consultants for project implementation, special studies, aerial
photography and mapping, and
(g) provision of funds for repair and improvement of the Birganj tubewell
systems constructed under Credit 373-NEP.
Project Design and Organization.
7.      The project was primarily a follc,-on project of Stage I (Bhairawa
Lumbini Groundwater Project - Cr. 654-.iEP) for expanding and improving DTW
groundwater irrigation facilities. The executing L6ency for the project was
the Groundwater Resources Development Board (GRDB) under the Ministry of Water
Resources (MOWR). The major lesson learned from the Stage I project was the
need to promote and include farmer participation as an integral part of the
project. Another important lesson was that efficient management and O&M of
DTWs were essential for their success, and that due to HMGN resource
constraints, recurrent budget allocations for O&M were likely to be
inadequate. These two lessons were emphasized in the Project Performance
Audit Report for the Stage I project (Report No. 5261). The introduction of
the new tubewell design, with undergound pipelines for improved water
conveyance from the pumphouse to the outlet, eliminated the delays in
implementation because of land acquisition problems, and improved overall
pumping and water delivery performance. The project's conzept was clear,
innovative and well understood by relevant parties, and the project was well
prepared. Its timing and scope were appropriate. Institutional adjustments
proposed in the SAR helped establish a strong project execrting agency.
Project Implementation
8.      General.  The project made a good start and proceeded smoothly
without dela~, in the early stag8  of implementation.  All 64 DTW irrigation
systems developed under Stage I are functioning satisfactorily and supplying
irrigation rater reliably. Farmer participation in the project area has been
excellent. The operation of 16 DTW irrigation systems developed with improved
technology was delayed due to failure by the contractor to install electrical
syste s to the wells. However, works were resumed and the power was expected
to be connected to all DTWs by the end of February 1991. The role of the O&M
DivisioiL was expanded to actively participate in the preparation of water
delivery schedules and assist farmers in pianni-g and constructing field
channels from outlets to the fields.  The Agrict,tural Division concentrated
on trasining farmers on water management and irrigated farming. By 1986, the
depreciation of the Nepalese rupee vis-a-vis the US$, from N!Rs 13.2 at
appraisal to NRs 20.0, and a further decline to NRs 30.15 per dollar at the
time of project closing resulted in a considerable balance of unutilized
funds. At the request of HMGN, IDA agreed to: (a) revise the project and
added the construction of 22 DTWs to the original scheme by using



the balance of funds in the Credit; and (b) extend the closing date by a year
and to complete the entire scheme by October 31, 1989. However, due to delays
caused by the trade and transit impasse with India, and to allow for the
completion of the additional DTWs, the closing date was extended for a second
time to October 31, 1990. Based on an exchange rate of NRs 13.2/-JS$, the
estimated cost of the project was NRs 258.2 million (excluding the Birganj
tubewell component). However, as a result of the rupee's depreciaticn, actual
expenditure at the end of the project was NRs 471.1 million (Table 5), with
more than double the original number of DTWs (16 units) financed. The
devaluation of local currency against the US dollar enabled the project to
cover accrued expenditures and the Credit of SDR 15.1 million was fully
disbursed on March 13, 1991 (Tabl3 3).
9.      Critical Factors and Procurement.  Three criticaS. countrywide
systemic factors were principally responsible for slowness in project
implementation, namely:
(a)   inefficient management of the Special Account (SA) by HMGN which
caused considerable delays in implementation and procurement of goods
and services. In effect, the Financial Comptroller General's Office
(FCGO) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) allowed the use of SA only
within the limits of sanctioned annual budgetary categories, which
were always short of the budget sought by the project (item (b)
below). The opening of the SA in July 1986 was intended to simplify
the small procurements demanded by the nature of the project.
However, because the use of the SA was contingent upon the iniclusion
of approved authority in the annual project budget, in a number of
occasions, the procurement invoices expired, and further delay was
added as the project management often had to request additional
validity, thereby lengthening the already long procurement process.
The manner in which the SA was operated obstructed the project for
prolonged periods. Following repeated IDA intervention on the
operation of the SA, HMGN formed a task force to review the operation
of SAs and its constraints and problems, but the task force has yet
to report.
(b)   insufficient annual budget ''locations for the project by HMGN also
delayed procurement of essential goods and services. Requested
budgets for the project were cut arbitrarily without consideration of
the works planned for the year. Although additional funds were
provided later in the year as supplementary budget allocations
following numerous supplications, this made it impossible for the
project to follow systematic annual implementation plans. MOF is
aware of the seriousness of this issue, and a study is under way to
find a solution.
(c)   the trade and transit impasse with India in FY90, which closed all
but two overland entry points to and from India, causing erratic
supply of fuel and crucial construction materials for tubewells. The
fuel shortage, in particular, stopped operation of heavy equipment
for well drilling and testing. The project virtually remained



- 5 -
inactive during this period. This was an unforeseen factor in
project implementation.
10.     Physical Works.  The construction of village roads and installation
of power transmission lines for the Stage I area were completed. All physical
targets set at appraisal for the Stage II area were met or exceeded except for
the construction of a few extension staff quarters due to budget cut. The
works carried out were of high standard. Of the 22 DTWs added during
implementation, 17 have been drilled and tested with the remaining works to
continue under the Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation III Project
(Table 4).   Although no Stage II DTWs were fully operable at Credit closing,
several were delivering partial water supplies from artesian flows. Funds for
the repair and improvement of the Birganj tubewell systems constructed under
Credit 373-NEP were channeled directly to the Narayani Zone Irrigation
Dev.elopment Board (NZIDB), and the works were carried out by the project
management of Credit 1715-NEP (Narayani Irrigation III Project) with
satisfactory performance. Details of this component will be reported later
under that Credit.
11.     Agricultural Extension, Training, Studies and Inputs Supply.   Many
farmers in the project area had inadequate knowledge of water management and
improved irrigated farming technology. Agricultural extension activities
carried out at two subcenters established under the project played an
important rcle to the success of the project. Intensive farmer training on
optimum cultivation techniques under irrigated conk  ions was instituted under
the project. Nearly 19,000 farmers and field extenbion workers have received
training since the inception of the project (Table 6a). They also established
well-organized crop demonstration plots on farmers' fields (Table 6b). The
demonstration plots for seasonal vegetables were especially popular, and
received great attention from the women in the community. The project had to
set up over 20 vegetable nurseries to produce sufficient seedlings. As part
of the extension activity, provision was made at appraisal that the project
would procure fertilizers of an estimated value of US$100,000 for distribution
to selected farmers. The aim was to provide fertilizer to progressive farmers
so that they could demonstrate the effect of its use in their fields to
increase production, anticipating that other farmers would eventually begin
using fertilizer. The plan had some merits at the time of appraisal, but was
not implemented due to problems in defining a satisfactory method for
fertilizer distribution. Four studies specified in the SAR were carried out
and submitted to the Bank. They were: (a) a future groundwater development
study; (b) socioecoromic impact study in the Stage I area; (c) farmer
participation in the project cycle and cost recovery; and (d) updating of the
feasibility study for the Stage III area (Table 7).
12.     Project Risks.  No major potential risks were identified by the
appraisal mission, although there was some concern with underutilization of
irrigation facilities in the low-lying areas. This concern later diminished,
as farmers in low-lying and waterlogged areas converted their fields into fish
ponds and are now realizing good incomes from fish production.

Project Results
13.     There are three primary results from the project: (a) increased
cropping intensities; (b) increased yields; and (c) increased farm incomes.
14.     Agricultural Production.  Agricultural data collected regularly over
the years in the Stage I area by the Project's Agricultural Division staff
indicate a substantial increase in crop intensities and yields. Both have
risen far above appraisal estimates. Between the time of appraisal (1982) and
the final crop season before the Credit closing (1990), yields of high-
yielding paddy, wheat, maize, and pulses increased by 111%, 145Z, 93Z, and
129%, respectively. The cropping intensity increased from 1212 at appraisal to
201% in 1990. These increases are attributable, among other things, to
successful implementation of the irrigated farming training program and on-
farm water management (para. 11). It is also evident that most of the low-
yielding local paddy has been replaced by high-yielding paddy varieties.
Furthermore, there has been a sharp increase in high-value vegetable crops.
Farmers are increasingly growing seasonal vegetables and marketing them
locally and in neighboring towns. A comparison between the cropping intensity
projected    appraisal and that estimated for the PCR is given in Table 8.
Yield comp,-isons are shown in Table 9. The agricultural production data from
the Stage II areas are not yet available as no Stage II DTWs were fully
operational at the time the project was closed. However, it is expected that
the cropping intensity and yields in the Stage II area will increase to at
least the levels of Stage I area as the improved design of DTW systems for
the Stage II area should enable even more timely irrigation water delivery
compared to Stage I DTWs.
15.     Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  The appraisal estimate of the ERR for
all Stage II DTWs (33 DTWs with a net area of 4,500 ha) was about 12%,
assuming five years for command area build-up and five to seven years of yield
build-up. Based on established crop intensities and yields' data from the
Stage I area, and actual expenditures incurred, the project ERR at PCR time
was estimated at 15Z. This rate of return is impressive, given the status of
the new technology introduced, and is largely attributable to the high levels
of incremental agricultural production actually achieved because of the
reliable DTW irrigation water supply (Table 10). This has created confidence
and motivation for farmers to participate in farmer training conducted by the
extension staff and to follow guidance provided by them. Project management
throughout the project period conscientiously supported all aspects of
project's agricultural activities.
16.     Other Benefits.  The combination of reliable irrigation with two
other key project investments, DTW electrification and access roads, has
produced a significant synergistic impact on economic development in the area.
Provision of electricity for pump operation eventually led to widespread rural
electrification in the project area giving cause to increased private sector
activity, including rice milling and cold storage. The construction of farm
roads, apart from facilitating O&M of the DTWs, was instrumental in achieving
the benefits from irrigation, since they facilitate delivery of inputs to
farmers and marketing of agricultural produce. They also gave additional



benefits in the form of increased communication, time and cost savings. This
is already evident from the manyfold increase in vehicle traffic on the
project roads, including regular bus routes. A significant health benefit to
the local population is the year-round availability of safe drinking water
from DTWs (water from the wells comes from the deep aquifer at about 120 m -
150 m).
Proiect Susthinability
17.     Based on the experience of Stage I DTWF, the project will have a
significant positive iripact on agricultural development and farm incomes in
the project area. Institutional strengthening that took place during
implementation, particularly the establishment of effective water users'
groups (WUGs), will facilitate sustained project operation under overall
public sector management with increased users' involvement. Water charges
were levied since 1986 in the Stage I area. Although farmer, had been
accustomed to receiving water free of charge for many years, in the second
year that water charges were assessed, the collection efficiency was 69Z
(Table 11). This level of collection is a satisfactory indication that the
project will be well sustained. With steady improvement in the availability
of power and the reliability of water supply, farmers will rapidly adopt
improved agricultural practices and gradually diversify their crop mix to
include higher value crops leading to increased farm productivity.
IDA Performance and Lessons
18.     The project introduced improved tubewell technology utilising
underground piped water distribution systems, avoided chronic problems with
land acquisition and assured reliable water supply when needed. IDA missions
provided assistance in identifying constraints and formulating suitable
project plans to deal with them. The SAR identified the key project
components required to overcome deficiencies in the existing systems. The SAR
also outlined a balanced agricultural development plan for overcoming
constraints that could otherwise impede improvement of agricultural
performance. Twelve supervision missions visited the project at an average
interval of six months (Table 12). Consistent Bank staff attention to the
project was apparent in the supervision reports, and constructive
recommendations were made by the various missions. Supervision combining both
groundwater engineering and agricultural expertise had a favorable impact on
both project implementation and agricultural performance.
19.     The following lessons may be learnt from the project:
(a)   When water from a tubewell is shared by some 100 different farmers,
imposing a disciplined O&H system is crucial to project success. For
this purpose, the formation of an effective Water Users' Group in
each system was mandated under the project. However, it was
difficult to organize effective WUGs until water was available and
the economic incentive of increased production through irrigation had
been demonstrated. Once a reliable and adequate supply of water was
secured, the formation of WUGs and the construction of field channels



- 8 -
was rapid. Until this economic incentive was demonstrated, farmers
had little desire to participate in the project cycle in the early
stages; and
(b)   Insistence by IDA that HMGN submit accounts and audit reports within
six months after the close of each fiscal year did not recognize that
the government systems did not allow for publishing reports within
the time specified. Thus, the DCA was later amended to allow for
submission up to 12 months after the closing of the fiscal year.
(c)   Unnecessary stipulations in the DCA that failure by farmers to carry
out the construction of field channels would cause the project to
undertake this construction and to recover the costs from the
beneficiaries (item (a) above).
Borrower's Performance
20.     Overall performance of project management was satisfactory.  As the
same project management established for the Stage I project undertook
implementation of the Stage II project, the project needed little adjustment
in the management structures, and implementation started smoothly.
Coordination of project management with other institutions was good. The
project engineers and extension staff worked harmoniously in advising farmers
on scheduling rotational water supply and construction of field channels.
They were flexible and responsive for accommodating farmer demands on the
extension of the lining of main watercourses and construction of additional
drainage facilities where appropriate. WUGs coordinated with project
management and participated in supervising minor construction works carried
out by local contractors.
21.     Performance and management of the Special Account by the FCGO,
however, was generally poor. Although HMGN assured IDA that this matter would
be studied and corrective measures taken (para. 9a), no satisfactory solutions
were reported at the time this PCR was prepared. Except for delays in
submitting accounts and audit reports, and, occasionally, quarterly project
progress reports, the Borrower's compliance with the Credit covenants was
satisfactory (Table 13).
Project Relationship
22.     IDA relationships with HHGN and the project management were good and
the positive working relationship played an important role in the succeesful
implementation of the project.
Consulting Services
23.     The project consultant (international firm) employed by the project
provided training, advice and guidance to project engineering staff in all
stages of project implementation, as well as preparation of bid documents and
evaluation. Consultant performance was satisfactory, particularly in
engineering supervision and developing O&M manuals for tubewells. It is also



- 9 -
noteworthy that the consenltant assisted in developing a well-staffed
mechanical workshop which is the only one in Nepal equipped with adequate
spare parts and appropriate equipment. The consultant has maintained a good
working relationship with the project authority and has also worked closely
with the beneficiaries.
Proiect Documentation and Data
24.     Preparation and appraisal concentrated on the appropriate issues
based on the experience and lessons learned during implementation of the Stage
I project. The SAR provided a useful framework for the project authority to
implement the project and for IDA's review of project progress. Submission of
half yearly project progress reports was frequently delayed; however, although
submission of the project accounts and audits within six months after the end
of each fiscal year was difficult for HMGN to comply with (para. 20), the data
relevant to the preparation of the PCR were readily available.

(Credit 1316-NEP)
PART II:   PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
IDA's Performance
25.     Successful completion of the project was only possible because of the
continued support and critical guidance of the International Development
Association (IDA). Earlier misgivings of the farmers toward the project have
faded as they have now seen the benefits from the project. The project deeply
appreciates the understanding shown by IDA in solving the problems encountered
during implementation of the project. One of many such instances is the
solution of the problem created by the introduction of the Special Account
(SA) of the project.
26.     IDA personnel conducting direct dialogues with farmers was also
helpful in strengthening the farmer's confidence and collaboration with the
project. It served well for IDA staff to obtain a first-hand understanding of
the project's environment and needs.
Borrower's Own Performance
27.     Overall performance of the organization participating in the project
was satisfactory. The project organization developed into a cohesive body,
although the works involved required coordination of many different
disciplines. The project staff has gained experience and confidence that they
could tackle any technical problems of tubewells. The project staff and the
Project Consultant have worked together in a coordinated manner. The
Agricultural Divisior. of the project should be complemented for its continued
effort and hara labor in convincing the farmers to change cropping patterns,
use high yielding varieties of seeds, etc., and thus the impact of the project
is highly visible. Some high value agricultural produce such as vegetable and
banana are abundantly grown in the project area. The farmers themselves
distribute the water in rotation. They also help to maintain the irrigation
system. Some of the drainage systems in the Stage I of the project have been
constructed after receipt of continued request for such construction from the
farmers, whereas the construction of drains was discontinued in face of stiff
resistance from the farmers ln the initial period. The collection of water
charges is reasonable, since water for irrigation is available whenever
needed. However, more improvement in collection of water charges is
desirable. A vetiver grass nursery, established in the project area following
the advice of IDA, performed well. By the request of many small projects in
Nepal, vetiver grass slips were distributed to them for soil and water
conservation works.



- 12 -
Lessons Learned
28.     Some tubewell systems have been constructed in the lowland.  As
lowland areas minimize the use of irrigation water, the selection of areas for
construction of tubewell irrigation systems should be carefully done.
Improvement of existing drainage and construction of new drainage system may
help in upgrading some of these lands.
29.     SA was introduced for providing sufficient funds in hand to the
project for smooth implementation. However, experience has shown that local
rules and regulations sometimes cause the SA to work to the contrary. The use
of SA should be avoided in future if HMGN's rules cannot be simplified.
