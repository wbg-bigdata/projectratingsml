INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MlALI
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$9.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for highway rehabil-
itation.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Mali is dealt with in paragraphs 2-13 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Mali for a Second Railway Project (Report No. P 1177a-MLI). A
Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's sixth operation in Mali, bringing
the total of IDA funds committed to US$43.5 million. For a review of Bank
Group lending in Mali, reference is made to paragraphs 14-18 of the Presiden.t's
Report of the same date on the proposed Second Railway Project. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 28, 1973, and notes
on the execution of on-going projects.
PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN MALI
4.        Reference should be made to paragraphs 19-28 of the President's
Report of the same date on the proposed Second Railway Project.
PART IV: THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
5.        A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project" (No. 61a-
MLI) is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided
in Annex III.



-2 --
6.        Bank Group involvement in Mali's transportation sector began in
1966 with the IDA Credit (95-sfIJ) of US$9.1 million to help finance a program
for rehabilitation and modernization of the railway. During appraisal of
that project, the need for a broad transport survey was noted and, in 1967,
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) agreed to finance such a survey
with the Bank as executing agency. The Belgian consultants, Societe de
Traction et d'Electricite (Tractionel), who were retained to carry out the
survey, submitted their final report in July 1969. Their main recommendations
concerning highways stressed the need to strengthen maintenance, to rehabilitate
aging trunk roads and to improve feeder roads in support of ongoing agricul-
tural programs. These recommendations provided a blueprint for IDA's first
highway lending operation in Mali: a highway maintenance project financed
by a US$7.7 million credit (197-MLI) in June 1970 which provided also for
feasibilitv studies and detailed engineering for the strengthening and rehabi-
litation of Mali's two main trunk roads linking Bamako with Bougouni to the
South and Segou to the northeast. The feasibility studies were completed by
the consultants, Kez International Ltd. of Canada (Kez).
The Project
7.        The proposed road project would be the second Bank Group lending
for highways in Mali. It would involve:
(a) the rehabilitation and strengthening of the two trunk
roads studied under Credit 197-MLTI, including super-
vision of construction by consultants;
(b) continuation of the ongoing highway maintenance and
feeder road betterment program through the provision
of additional technical assistance and training;
(c) purchase of highway maintenance equipment;
(d) detailed engineering by consultants for the upgrading
of the Bamako-Kolokani road (120 km); and
(e)  Studv of the trucking industry.
8.        Mali's two major trunk roads would be rehabilitated under the
project. The roads radiate from Bamako to the regional centers of Bougouni
and Segou, with the first 7 km from Bamako to Faladie being common to both
roads. The Faladie-Bougouni section (148 km) serves the cultivated region
to the south and forms part of the important international link with the
Ivory Coast; the Faladie-Segou section (223 km) links the capital with the
cotton-producing areas around Segou and comprises part of the only all-
weather link with Mopti, the gateway to the Niger River basin. The Bougouni
section will also serve the new international airport under construction at



- 3 -
Senou, 10 km south of Bamako. Built in the early fifties, the two project
roads are Mali's oldest paved linlks and are now clearly unsuitable for present
traffic volumes. Narrow pavement and alignment defects create unsafe driving
conditions. On numerous sections the base and sub-base are structurally
inadequate and current maintenance works consisting of patching and sealing
are of limited use.
9.        While the IDA-financed highway maintenance project of 1970 is
now proceeding well, progress in the early stages was somewhat slower than
had been envisaged when the project was appraised. Technical assistance
being provided to the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) by the International
Labour Office (ILO) will be extended in order to assure that the objectives
of the program are realized. Funds are therefore provided under this pro-
posed credit for the extension of the consultants' services.
10.       The maintenance equipment which would be financed under the project
represents DPW's acquisition needs for 1973 and 1974. Requirements are based
on demand for renewal of items in the existing equipment fleet, adjusted to
traffic levels and the desired standard of road.
11.       In 1971, the DPW commissioned the joint venture of consultants,
SEMA (Mali) and SCET International (France), to carry out a feasibility study
for the improvement of various sections of the 300 km trunk road extending
north from Bamako to the Mauritanian border. The road is paved to Kati (15 km)
and gravelled for the next 160 km; the remaining section to the border is on
earth track. The study, financed by the Government, was completed in November
1971. The consultants recommended upgrading the section of the road between
Kati and Kolokani (105 km) around 1975. Upgrading the road to engineered
gravel standard clearly seems to be justified, and its paving may even be
feasible. Under the proposed highway project, detailed engineering and
complementary economic studies of the proposed upgrading will be carried out.
12.       Control of the transport industry by Government through ownership
of transport assets and complementary regulatory policies has led to only
partially satisfactory results. Although Mali has been able to satisfy its
most pressing needs for internal and external communication, the industry
as a whole has been unduly strained. The official rates for both public and
private sector road transport have remained unchanged since 1967. The rates
charged are substantially lower than those for road haulage in neighboring
countries with similar economic and physical conditions. Further, indica-
tions are that these low rates make it extremely difficult for even reason-
ably efficient road carriers to generate funds for renewal or expansion of
their vehicle fleets. In particular, the state-owned Mali Road Transport
Company (CMTR), although recently reorganized, is still unable to service its
debt. During negotiations, therefore, the Association sought and secured
assurances from the Government that the official rates for road transport
services will be reviewed. Accordingly, a study of the trucking industry
will be undertaken by suitable consultants to assist the Government in its



-4-
efforts to irmrove the viabilitv and efficiency of the trucking industry.
The main focus of the study will be on the design of a pricing policy for the
industrv which will allow carriers to cover the costs of their services.
Terms of Reference for the study were also discussed and a-reed with the
Government at the time of negotiations.
Cost and Financing
13.       The total cost of the project, including taxes, is estimated at
US$20.5 million with a foreign exchange component of US$14.7 million. Ex-
ternal financing in the amount of US$16.1 million would be provided by the
proposed IDA Credit (US$9.5 million) and USAID (US$6.6 million); the USAID
loan would be repayable over 40 years, with 10 years grace and vould bear
interest at 2 percent during the grace period and 3 percent thereafter. Both
the IDA credit and the AID loan would make small contributions to local cur-
rency expenditures; the balance of these expenditures would be financed by a
contribution from Mtali in the amount of US$4.4 million equivalent, including
US$3.3 million of taxes. The cost of the project, net of taxes, would be
shared as follows: TDA 55 percent, USAID 38 percent and Mali 7 percent.
14.       USAID will finance the total cost, net of taxes, of improving the
Bamako-Bougouni road. The IDA contribution will be used for improving the
Faladie-Segou road, for the services of consultants for supervision of con-
struction of both the USAID and the IDA-fincnced roads, for technical assist-
ance and training, for the engineering studies, and for the study of the
trucking industry. IDA and USAID will share the financing of road mainten-
ance equipment in the amounts of US$850,000 and US$1.5 million respectively
(before contingencies).
Project Execution, Procurement and Supervision
15.       The Directorate of Public Works (DPI) in the Ministry of Indlustrial
Development and Public Works will be responsible for execution of the project.
To acconmodate the fact that USAID's procurement conditions differ from those
of the Association, the rehabilitation works are divided into two parts, as
notedl. USAID assisting in the financing of the Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni road
(15-, kmn) to he tendered according to USAID regulations.  Further, that portion
of tlh? road maintenance equipment to be financed by ISAID will be tied to pro-
curement in the United States.   The Faladie-Segou road (223 kmn), which is to
be financed by the Association, will be constructed under a single, unit-price
contract after international co.mpetitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines.   road maintenance equipment financed by the Association will also
be procured through international competitive bidding.
16.       Supervision of construction will be by consultants, provided under
the project, who will be employed for both the IDA- and USAID-financed sections
in order to avoid duplication of staff and equipment as well as to ensure
better coordination.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUTMLNTS AND AUTHIORITY
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Mali, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for
highway development projects.
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOI4U-ENDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B.   Projects in Execution
Credit 95-MLI:  First Railway Project
The US$9.1 million First Railway Project of 1966 (95-fL,I), the
physical program of which lagged behind schedule at one time by about three
years, is now almost completed in terms of physical content. The closing date,
set initially for June 30, 1970, was first postponed to December 31, 1971. The
Association, however, agreed that savings of $480,000 under the credit should
be used for track renewal on an additional 14 km of track and therefore ex-
tended the closing date to December 31, 1972. Most recently, the credit's
closing date has been further postponed to June 30, 1973, because of a delav in
delivery of equipment. Progress toward the financial targets of the project
has also been slow. In particular, the Railway's financial situation has been
precarious but is now improving. The RCFP's liquidity position has been poor
due to the large volume of debt owed partly to the Government and partly to
the Senegal Railway. The Government, however, has recently acted to lessen



ANNEX II
Page 2 of 2
RCFM's debt burden by waiving AIF 788 million owed to it bv the Regie. Fur-
ther, Government has agreed to continne waiving RCFM payments of interest and
principal on the proceeds of Credit 95-MLI, relent to the Regie, and compen-
sating the Regie for payments made by the latter to the Senegal Railway for
equipment charges.
Credit 197-MLI: First Highway Project
The US$7.7 million First Highway Project of 1970 (197-MLI) is being
carried out with the assistance of two teams of experts, from the International
Labor Organization (ILO), which are providing technical assistance, including
help to reorganize the Equipment Department of the National Directorate of
Public Works (DPW). The Borrower's performance is good and the project is
progressing satisfactorily after a slow start (see paragraph 9).
Credit 277-MLI: Mopti Rice Project
The USS6.9 million Rice Development Credit of January 1972 (277-MLI)
is now making satisfactory progress after initial delays due to Government
budgetary constraints and the lack of knowledge of IDA procedures by officials
of the relevant Ministry. It is expected that the project's main civil works
contract, awqarded recently, should be completed within two years, or one year
ahead of appraisal schedule.
Credit 321-MtI:  Telecommunications Project
The US$3.6 million Telecommunications Project of June 1972 (321-MLI)
is not yet effective. The date of effectiveness, originally November 1, 1972,
has been postponed several times. The new date is April 20, 1973, and the
credit is expected to become effective upon receipt of a duly prepared legal
opinion from Government.

Procurement Arrangements:   Given the project's parallel financing arrange-
ments and the fact that USAID's procurement
conditions differ from those of the Associa-
tion, the highway rehabilitation works are
divided into two parts, USAID assisting in the
financing of the Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni road
(155 kn) to be tendered according to USAID
regulations, i.e., the contracting firm must
be either American, Malian or indigenous to
a Part II country in the "free world." Further,
that portion of the road maintenance equipment
to be financed by USAID will be tied to pro-
curement in the United States. The Faladie-
Segou road (223 kmi), which is to be financed
by the Association, will be constructed under
a single, unit-price contract after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Road maintenance equipment financed
by the association will also be procured through
international competitive bidding.
Consultants:                Consultants will be employed for construction
supervision, technical assistance and train-
ing, and engineering studies under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association.
Rate of Return:             Economic return on the project is calculated
at 30 percent.
