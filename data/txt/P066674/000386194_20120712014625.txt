      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Mexico Indigenous and
Community Biodiversity Conservation Project (COINBIO). The total cost of the project
at appraisal was US$19.05 million; actual cost was US$ 24.52 million. The project was
financed through a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of US$7.85 million, of
which actual disbursements were US$7.83 million and US $19,860 was cancelled. The
project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on November 28, 2000,
became effective on June 21, 2001, and closed as planned on April 30, 2008.

This PPAR was prepared by April Connelly, IEG Evaluation Analyst, as an input to
IEG‟s evaluation of the World Bank Group‟s support for Managing Forest Resources for
Sustainable Development.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including Implementation
Completion and Results Report, Project Appraisal Document, legal document and project
files, background studies, and academic literature. Discussions were held with: Bank staff
in both Washington, D.C., and in Mexico, project beneficiaries, government officials,
representatives of non- governmental organizations. An IEG mission visited Mexico in
October 2011. IEG held meetings in Mexico City, Morelia, and Oaxaca. A list of all
those interviewed is attached in Annex B. The cooperation and assistance provided by all
stakeholders, particularly the National Forestry Commission and their dedicated staff, as
well as the support of the World Bank Country Office in Mexico are greatly appreciated.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
Government officials and agencies for their review and comment. No comments have
been received from the Borrower.

Summary
This is a project performance assessment of the Mexico Indigenous and Community
Biodiversity Conservation Project (COINBIO). The Project's Global Environmental
Objective was to conserve high biodiversity in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán, and
Guerrero by strengthening and promoting community conservation initiatives on
communally-owned lands, building on the cultural values and traditional management
practices that such communities have developed in relationship to the resources in these
areas.

The project‟s objective was in line with the Bank‟s assistance strategy at the time of
project appraisal and continues to be relevant to the current assistance strategy. It is also
relevant to Global Environment Facility priorities of in-situ conservation of globally
unique biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and local participation in the benefits
of conservation activities. The project‟s objective is consistent with national goals and
strategies for biodiversity conservation. Mexico is a signatory to the Convention on
Biological Diversity and the National Biodiversity Strategy promotes the development of
programs to strengthen indigenous and community conservation practices. The project‟s
decentralized implementation structure is also in line with the Secretary of Environment‟s
strategic shift toward the decentralization of environmental and natural resource
management towards the states and municipalities while increasing local community
participation. Relevance of project design, however, was only modest. The project used
an innovative approach, the first attempt by the Bank and the Global Environment
Facility to involve communities in biodiversity conservation. It included several relevant
design features: it was attuned to the prevailing tenure status, responded to community
sensitivities by employing a demand-driven approach, and took into account variation in
community capacity. However, the program logic was vague, lacking a clear articulation
of how individual activities would ensure conservation over the long term.

The project succeeded in establishing institutional arrangements at the State level that
support communities in conservation planning and sustainable land use activities and lent
legitimacy to community conservation efforts as a conservation model. At the time of the
IEG assessment mission, more than three years after the project‟s closure, this
mechanism continues to function in two of the three states where it was piloted and
efforts are ongoing to expand the model to a third state. However, there is insufficient
evidence to demonstrate the contribution of these efforts to biodiversity outcomes.

Project implementation was challenged by three factors. First, a significant disbursement
lag occurred during the first few years of implementation as a result of changes in
government administration at the national and state levels and a learning curve associated
with the decentralized and demand driven nature of the project. Second, delays in hiring a
national coordinator and in convening the national committee deprived the project of
clear central leadership, contributing to a void in the project‟s strategic decision making
and reduced the space for the resolution of internal conflicts, resulting in implementation
bottlenecks. Third, an inspection panel investigation was requested by the state
coordination committee in Oaxaca in response to the firing of two State Coordinators.

Sustainability of the institutional mechanism is contingent on the will of the government
to allocate budget resources each year. Three years after the pilot project closed, the
program continues to function with both state and federal government budget support.
The threats to biodiversity and the measures to address them vary by community. Some
communities have organized committees to carry out vigilance patrols against fires,
unauthorized extraction of wood and hunting. Others lack such arrangements and
reported a lack of interest in project goals within the broader community, beyond those
who directly participated in the project. Some communities have voluntarily registered
their conservation areas with the National Council for Natural Protected Areas and are
subject to independent monitoring. The land management tools provided by the project
have allowed some communities to leverage funds from other government programs,
such as environmental service contracts, providing additional incentives to maintain their
community conservation areas. The sustainability of productive subprojects, however, is
less certain. At project closure most of the productive investments supported by the
project had not yet reached full cost recovery and there was no data to indicate how many
of these activities remained viable at the time of the assessment mission.

On balance this assessment rates overall project outcome as moderately unsatisfactory,
based on the high relevance of the objectives, but modest relevance of design, modest
efficiency, and modest achievement of the objective of conserving biodiversity. The risk
to development outcome is moderate. The Bank‟s performance was moderately
satisfactory at entry. Project preparation built on lessons from previous operations.
Selection of project areas was based on a sound analysis of their priority for biodiversity
conservation as well as the capacity and interest of communities in conservation. A
shortcoming in ensuring quality at entry was the decision to waive the hiring of a
National Coordinator as a condition of effectiveness, which led in turn to implementation
challenges in the initial years of operation. The Bank‟s performance during supervision
was also moderately satisfactory. The Bank increased supervision efforts to correct
quality at entry weaknesses and brought the project back on track when a request for the
inspection panel threatened implementation. However, a shortcoming, reflecting on both
Bank and Borrower performance, was the delay in the implementation of a critical
component of the project‟s monitoring and evaluation system until the final year of the
project.

The assessment rates Borrower performance as moderately satisfactory. The
government‟s commitment to the project during preparation was demonstrated by its
request to expand the preparation of a medium sized project to be implemented in one
state into full sized project piloted in three states. The government has continued to
support the model, devoting budget to its continued implementation three years following
project completion. The implementing agency adequately administered the grant and
complied with Bank fiduciary and safeguards procedures. However, along with the Bank,
the implementing agency is accountable for the delays in hiring a National Coordinator
for the project and in the establishment of a critical component of the projects M&E
system. In addition, the manner in which the implementing agency handled the
termination of the State Coordinators contributed to the conflict with some of the State
Committees culminating in the project being referred to the inspection panel. Following
this crisis however, the implementing agency and project management team adequately
                                             xi


addressed implementation challenges, so that the project finished on time, meeting most
of its output targets.

The project experience points the following lessons:

   The lack of a common understanding of the respective roles and level of
    autonomy of all parties in a decentralized management structure can undermine
    implementation. In this case differences in interpretation of the level of autonomy
    delegated to state level actors contributed to an impasse between some of the state
    coordination units and the national implementing agency, a situation that threatened
    to bring project implementation to a halt and that contributed to an inspection panel
    request. Eventually these issues were resolved, but the experience highlights the
    importance of taking explicit measures during project implementation to ensure that
    all parties are on the same page.

   The project’s experience reveals the challenges associated with developing
    monitoring tools that are adequate for both conservation and capacity building
    objectives. Participatory monitoring is important for enhancing community capacity
    to monitor and make decisions over the management of their natural resources.
    Measuring conservation outcomes may require ecosystem-level analysis. One tool or
    approach may not be adequate for both objectives.

   The project’s experience in carrying out participatory monitoring illustrates the
    need to employ methods that are useful to communities and can be continued
    beyond the project’s closure. While community participation was included in the
    monitoring exercise, the methods used were out of step with the communities‟
    capacity to continue monitoring over the long term. The experience points to the need
    to ensure that communities are provided with adequate incentives and support over
    long run.

   A recurring shortcoming in the implementation of small grant type projects is
    the failure to monitor subproject outcomes. Since the demand-driven nature of
    participatory operations like this one limits the ability to specify objectives of sub-
    projects up-front extra effort is required in the course of implementation to document
    the goals communities for themselves, their plan for achieving these goals, and to
    monitor resulting outcomes.

1. Background and Context
1.1     Mexico is one of 17 mega-diverse countries1 in the world and ranks fourth among
them in overall species richness (Martin and others 2010). Although the country covers only
one percent of the earth‟s land area, it contains one tenth of the terrestrial vertebrates and
plants known to science (Bray and Merino 2002, Merino and Martinez 2009). Mexico is also
notable for its high number of endemic species (species that are not naturally found
elsewhere). Between 50 and 60 percent of the known plants of Mexico are endemic.2

1.2     Mexico‟s forests harbor a significant portion of its biodiversity: 80 percent of
vascular plants and 75 percent of vertebrates occurs in forest areas (Bray and Merino-Perez
2002). Biodiversity in forest areas is under threat from the expansion of the agriculture
frontier, overexploitation for timber and firewood collection, and urban growth. Fire, pests,
disease and exotic species also play a role. Underlying the pressures on Mexico‟s forests are
inadequate incentives to protect and manage them (World Bank 2000).

1.3     Over 70 percent of Mexico‟s forests lands are under collective tenure, as a
consequence of an extended Agrarian Reform implemented from the 1930‟s to the 1980‟s3
(Ortiz, Gabriela; Merino, Leticia 2011). Further reforms in 1992 strengthened community
rights to exploit their forests (Bray and others 2005). Mexico‟s Agrarian Law recognizes two
groups of collective property owners: ejidos and agrarian communities. Ejidos are land
reform communities created following the Mexican revolution, when the state granted lands
to groups of solicitors. Agrarian communities are indigenous communities that predate
Spanish colonization. The state recognizes historical property rights over the territories these
communities claimed as their own (Merino and Martinez 2009). 4

1.4      Self-governance of communities is based on a traditional system of participation and
shared responsibilities (Martin and others 2010). The highest authority in the community is
the assembly of agrarian land owners who meet regularly (typically once a month) to discuss
matters of common interest, including decisions over common assets such as communal
forests. Leadership is provided by a body of commissioned officials who are elected on a
rotating basis to a three year term. The communal governance framework also includes a
tradition of non paid labor obligations for the maintenance of the communities‟
infrastructure, provision of public services and in some cases forest protection and restoration
activities (Merino 2011).

1.5     At the time of project appraisal, there were several programs in support of productive
forest management by communities, including the Bank-funded Community Forestry Project,
1
  Mega diverse countries possess nearly 70 percent of global species diversity. According to some authors there
are 12 mega diverse countries: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. Others increase the list to more than 17, adding
Papua New Guinea, South Africa, USA, Philippines and Venezuela.

  Endemic species can easily become endangered or extinct because of their restricted distribution.
3
  Mexico was the first country in the world where collective property was recognized by the state and is only
surpassed by Papua New Guinea in terms of the percent of natural forests owned by communities (Merino et al,
USAID Mexico. 2009).

but there was no government-supported program for the sustainable management of forests
of limited commercial timber potential and there was no instrument for the decentralized
implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy. The National Biodiversity Strategy
identifies four priority areas for action: (i) protection of biodiversity rich ecosystems; (ii)
sustainable use of Mexico's biological resources; (iii) expansion of the country's knowledge
base related to its biodiversity; and (iv) promotion of green markets/valuation of biological
resources. The main instrument for biodiversity protection was the System of Protected
Natural Areas (SINAP).

1.6     In 2000, as the project was being prepared, the SINAP system covered only three
percent of national territory, it was administratively cumbersome and the government faced
difficulty in expanding the system. Much of the areas prioritized for conservation fell outside
of the existing protected areas. National protected areas are created by presidential decree
and do not allow community use of resources and efforts to convert communal land to
government, private or co-managed areas are often met with resistance (Martin and others
2010). For these reasons many researchers active in biodiversity protection concluded that
while the national strategy of establishing national protected areas was important, it was not
sufficient for meeting the country‟s biodiversity needs on its own, and identified the need to
develop biodiversity conservation on community-held lands as a complementary strategy.

1.7     The project provided a complement to the SINAP approach by focusing on
conservation through the indigenous and community sectors, and protecting biodiversity
through non-federal conservation regimes. It also complemented other forestry and
biodiversity programs under implementation at the time of its preparation, such as the Bank-
financed Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF) and the UNDP executed GEF-
implemented forest project (PRODERS, Table 1). The former focused on production forestry
rather than conservation and the latter focused on tropical forests, while COINBIO focused
on temperate forests. Moreover, PRODERS concentrated more on reducing pressures on
forest and protected areas through building the sustainable production capacity of rural
producers, as opposed to establishing community conservation areas.

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1     The articulation of the Global Environment Objective (GEO)5 differs between the
grant agreement and the project appraisal document, and within the project appraisal
document.

2.2      According to the grant agreement, “(t)he objective of the Project is to conserve high
biodiversity in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán and Guerrero by strengthening and
promoting community conservation initiatives on communally-owned lands, building on the
cultural values and traditional management practices that such communities have developed
in relationship to the resources in these areas? (schedule 2).

2.3     Three additional versions of the GEO are presented in the project appraisal document.
The first is substantively similar to the version found in the grant agreement: “The objective
of the project is to conserve areas of high biodiversity by strengthening and promoting
community conservation initiatives on communally owned lands in areas of high biodiversity
in a priority set of ecological zones in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán , and Guerrero,
building on the positive cultural values and traditional management practices that these
communities have developed over a long period in relationship to the resources in these
ecological zones? (World Bank 2002. pp. 2 and 47).

2.4     The second version of the GEO includes a distinct pilot objective: “(the) global
objective of the project is to conserve some of the most unique and biologically diverse areas
of Mexico, along with testing a model that may be applicable to indigenous reserves and
other communally-owned land in other parts of Latin America? (pg. 2).6 This version of the
GEO was also referenced in the borrower‟s completion report on the project.

2.5     The third version of the GEO is found in the hierarchy of objectives table in an annex
to the project appraisal document: “(t)o achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in
the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán and Guerrero by strengthening the capacity of indigenous
and ejido communities to manage and protect their biological and cultural resources based on
traditional values and practices? (pg. 36, Hierarchy of Objectives Table). This version was

5
 Freestanding GEF projects executed by the Bank are assessed in relation to their Global Environment
Objective, rather than the standard project development objective in World Bank projects.
6
  The intention of the project to serve as a pilot is also alluded to in the discussion of institutional reforms
supported by the project, “State-level committees are being created as a pilot institutional mechanism to support
community-level? (PAD, pg. 12); The description of component 3: “Grants would finance sustainable pilot
subprojects proposed by the communities to preserve their biodiversity values?(PAD, pg. 54); “(The project)
will provide resources for piloting income generating activities in adjacent areas and disseminating knowledge
of these experiences throughout the project area?(PAD, pg. 49); “(The project will) pilot a green venture
scheme as one of the subproject options which would provide interested communities who are ready to manage
their own long-term investments with a limited amount of venture capital to enable them to learn how to
manage such funds for community ventures related to their natural resource base and existing conservation land
use planning?(PAD, pg. 91); “The proposed project is expected to provide models that can be disseminated and
adapted for use elsewhere in Mexico and in other countries? ( PAD, pg. 21).
                                               4


used in project supervision documents throughout implementation as well as in the project
completion report. It sets the bar for achievement higher than the other versions by aiming
for “more effective biodiversity conservation?.

2.6      The objective stated in the grant agreement will be used as the basis of assessment, as
this is the legally binding document.

2.7     The project was to be carried out in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán, and Guerrero.
These states contain a high concentration of the globally significant biodiversity in Mexico
and almost all of Mexico‟s ecosystems are represented among them. In spite of the fact that
the natural habitat within these states is rich in biodiversity, at appraisal little was under
official protection. In the state of Oaxaca, for example, a study conducted by the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources found that approximately 26 percent of the state‟s
territory merited permanent conservation to ensure adequate biodiversity protection, yet only
3.8 percent was within the National Protected Area System. The percent of areas under
official protection at the time of appraisal was similar in Guerrero and Michoacán.

2.8      A biological assessment was conducted during project preparation to identify
potential project areas within each State, building on the National Commission for
Biodiversity‟s criteria for the selection of priority areas for biodiversity conservation. A
participatory social assessment process, measuring community interest and capacity for
conservation, identified 1,300 communities that were eligible to present proposals for project
funding within the priority biological zones. The communities were further classified by their
level of absorptive and organizational capacity into four subsets, which determined their
eligibility for specific types of project activities.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.9     The relevance of the project‟s objectives is rated high. The Project‟s objective of
conserving biodiversity by strengthening and promoting community conservation initiatives
on communally owned lands has a high degree of relevance to World Bank, Global
Environment Facility (GEF), and National strategies. It is consistent with the 1999 Country
Assistance Strategy‟s (CAS) emphasis on reinforcing local and indigenous communities and
the goal of working to enhance biodiversity conservation and strengthen institutional
frameworks. The objective remains relevant to the 2008 CAS‟s emphasis on environmental
sustainability, promoting social inclusion and strengthening institutions. The project‟s
objective is also in line with the GEF Operational Programs 4 (Montane Ecosystems) and 3
(Forest Ecosystems), and three GEF priorities: in situ conservation of globally unique
biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and local participation in the benefits of
conservation activities.

2.10 Biodiversity conservation is also consistent with national priorities and policies.
Mexico is a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which promotes the
sustainable use of natural resources in accordance with the rights and traditional knowledge
of indigenous communities. The project‟s objective is in line with national priorities
identified in the Mexican biodiversity strategy: (i) protection of biodiversity rich ecosystems;
(ii) sustainable use of Mexico‟s biological resources; (iii) expansion of the country‟s
                                               5


knowledge base related to its biodiversity; and (iv) promotion of green market/valuation of
biological resources. The strategy also recognizes the importance of indigenous and
community conservation practices and supports development of innovative programs to
strengthen such approaches to natural resource management. Finally, the project is
consistent with the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources‟ shift toward the
decentralization of environmental and natural resource management towards the states and
municipalities while increasing local community participation.

DESIGN

2.11   The project had four components:

2.12 Component 1. Local Capacity Building (US$2.7 million Appraisal Estimate;
US$7.75 million Actual Costs). This component financed the costs of three State Committees
and the coordinating units, which were the decision-making and oversight bodies for
activities at the state level. Activities financed included coordinating unit consultant fees,
funds for technical assistance to communities and ejidos, training of the coordinating unit in
financial and technical monitoring, operational expenses, and costs of consultation and
regional meetings.

2.13 Component 2: Community Conservation and Sustainable Use Sub-projects (US$
12.9 million Appraisal Estimate; US$15.13 million Actual Costs). This component channeled
grant resources to communities to finance a progressive series of community conservation
and sustainable land use subprojects tailored to the level of organization and willingness of
participating communities to undertake long-term conservation (Box 1). Incipient
communities with interest in conservation activities but limited organizational skills and
insufficient experience with conservation investment (Category 1) were eligible for grants to
help finance land use planning, community conservation action plans, diagnostic studies and
inventories, and training events that build their capacity for conservation. The more advanced
and experienced communities (Categories 2-4) were also eligible for grants to help finance
activities that assist them to actively manage and protect areas designated for conservation,
including fire control, demarcation, delimitation, or restoration, and activities that promote
the sustainable use of natural resources in adjacent resource areas to generate income while
reducing pressure on conservation areas.

2.14 Four types of conservation and sustainable land use activities (Types A-D) were
eligible for grant allocation, each with a different community counterpart requirement, and
each with a progressively larger grant size:

2.15 Type A: Land Use Planning for the Establishment of Biodiversity Conservation
Areas: includes workshops, participatory rural appraisals, land use planning, mapping,
inventories of existing biodiversity resources, and delimitation of conservation areas
including preparation of by-laws or communal statutes (where appropriate) for the creation of
permanent conservation areas. Grant amounts for these activities would range in size from
$5,000 to $15,000, and the counterpart contribution would be at least 10% of total costs,
costs, presented as in kind contributions of local labor, travel, participation in workshops and
evaluations, and community meetings.

Box 1: Community eligibility criteria and organizational categories
Eligibility Criteria
All communities eligible for participation in the project must: (a) be located in priority biodiversity
zones; (b) contain a minimum area of biodiversity in their land boundaries; (c) express a willingness
to conserve areas of biodiversity; (d) have communal or ejido ownership with legal property rights;
(e) be free of community and border conflicts; and (f) submit proposals that have been agreed upon
by communal assemblies.

Community Organizational Categories
Category 1: Communities with established rules of access to their natural resources but no formal
community statute, management plan, and/or assembly agreement about the use of and access to
community natural resources; and the absence of conservation and sustainable use projects.
Category 2: Communities with established land use plans but incipient conservation and sustainable
use projects; with or without restricted areas of natural vegetation for socio-cultural or environmental
reasons.
Category 3: Communities with established conservation areas, functioning conservation and
sustainable use projects, and restricted areas of natural vegetation for socio-cultural or environmental
reasons.
Category 4: Communities with enterprises with separate administrative structure. These communities
comply with characteristics of Category 3 communities, plus have enterprises with administrative
structure for the use of community resources, coordinated by but independent of the community's
political entity).

Category 1 and 2 communities were expected to apply for capacity-building grants before progressing
to investment activities. Category 3 and 4 communities were eligible for the project‟s full range of
capacity building and investment activities.


       Type B: Training and Capacity-Building, including Horizontal Exchanges7:
        provides finance for capacity building for conservation activities, including training
        for communities provided by third parties and by more advanced communities to less
        advanced ones and for feasibility studies (for Type C activities). Grant amounts
        would range from $2,000 to $8,000 per community with a matching contribution of at
        least 20%.

       Type C: Community Investments for Conservation Areas and Sustainable Use:
        provides finance for investment in conservation areas or in complementary
        sustainable land uses, including investments to protect or improve the administration
        of conservation areas, as well as investments and feasibility studies that generate
        sustainable alternatives for communities. Activities may include forest certification
        studies, market studies, seed capital for eco-tourism projects, and non-timber forest
        product enterprises, infrastructure and management of conservation areas. Grant
        amounts would range in size from $15,000 to $20,000. All Type C proposals would
        be based on a matching formula, with a community counterpart of at least 25% for
        sustainable use projects and at least 20% for conservation activities.

7
 “Horizontal exchanges? are community to community workshops, often led by more advanced communities,
with the goal of developing capacity through the exchange of experiences.
                                                7


      Type D: Community Green Venture Funds: Applicable to communities that had
       developed the capacity to invest in more substantial projects of sustainable land use
       and which have a longer term commitment to conservation of their permanent areas
       and were to be eligible for a fourth type of grant investment, which would be a
       payment into a revolving fund established at the community level as a separate
       conservation account. Grant amounts were expected to be between $20,000 and
       $50,000, with at least an equivalent amount of community counterpart.

2.16 Component 3: Biological Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.5 million Appraisal
Estimate; US$0.22 million Actual Costs): Project monitoring was to include both physical
execution and biodiversity changes over time, including information related to the viability
of the conservation sites being established. Participatory evaluation studies would be
designed and carried out to document social organizational processes. The component also
envisaged supporting an interactive geo-referenced database referred to as an Integrated
Information System (SII). Evaluation activities would include an initial review at the end of
the second year and a mid-term review at the end of the fourth year. Biodiversity data were to
be forwarded into the Clearing House Mechanism managed by the Government of Mexico.

2.17 Component 4: National Coordination (US$1.6 million Appraisal Estimate;
US$1.07 Actual Costs) This component supported the costs of the national coordination unit,
the national oversight committee, the supervision and monitoring activities, establishment of
the legal and conceptual framework for community conservation as a valid protected area
model, and reporting to the Government and Bank. It also financed evaluation and
dissemination activities, including documenting project lessons and sharing these findings
with other community and indigenous groups in Mexico and Latin American region, to
facilitate cross-fertilization of experiences with innovative programs across states and
elsewhere in Latin America.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.18 Relevance of design is rated modest. The project employed an innovative approach.
This was the first attmept by GEF and the World Bank to involve local communities in
biodiversity conservation. The project‟s institutional design was in line with the prevailing
communal tenure status of forestland and the demand-driven approach responded to
communities‟ resistance to externally imposed conservation policies. Other relevant design
features were: the tailoring of project activities to different communities based on their level
of organization, experience and capacity; and the establishment of a national committee to
ensure that relevant national institutions were involved in project implementation and
recognize the approach as a valid conservation model.

2.19 However, the principal shortcoming in project design was the lack of a clear results
chain. The theory of change was not well articulated and not monitored. The project does not
clearly identify the specific threats to biodiversity that its activities will address and how
project activities will do so. Some threats noted in the background discussion are clearly
beyond the scope of a small grants program. Others are within the scope of the project‟s
activities but the theory of change (i.e. generation of sufficient income to avoid unsustainable
land use alternatives) is not monitored. The link between subprojects and the projects
                                                         8


objectives also vague. On the face of it the different subproject categories could potentially
contribute to enhanced biodiversity. But it is unclear if the activities within each subproject
category are sufficient on their own to lead to the projects biodiversity objective.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.20 The project was designed with several monitoring and evaluation (M&E) elements.
Key performance indicators8 and numerical targets were identified at appraisal and
provisions for monitoring project implementation were provided under the National
Coordination component. State coordination units were responsible for collecting data on
performance indicators in their respective states. However, most were output rather than
outcome indicators and they are insufficient for monitoring changes in biodiversity or
community capacity as a result of project activities. Some of the indicators were not clearly
defined. There were also disconnects between some indictors and the final outcome. For
example, there is an indicator for the number of land use plans developed by communities
but no indicator to monitor their implementation.

2.21 The project also included a separate dedicated M&E component that aimed to
develop an interactive geo-referenced database, referred to as an Integrated Information
System that would establish baseline data and monitor changes in biodiversity over time. The
M&E component also provided resources to carry out participatory evaluation studies to
document social organizational processes. Biodiversity data collected for the project was to
be incorporated into a biodiversity clearing house mechanism managed by the Government
of Mexico. An initial evaluation was planned for the end of the second year of
implementation to review implementation mechanisms and if needed adjust the criteria and
procedures in the operational manual. A midterm review was planned for the end of the
fourth year to allow for adjustments in targets and the distribution of sub-grant activities
among the different types of participating communities. The national coordination unit would
provide oversight of the Integrated Information System and other evaluations.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.22 The project had a multi-tiered management structure (Figure 1). The National
Financial Agency (NAFIN) served as both the Executing Agency and financial administrator

8
    The project appraisal document specifies the following key performance indicators:
1. 150,000 hectares under community conservation in different ecozones in the project area, and 150,000
hectares of complementary area under sustainable use.
2. Seventy organizationally advanced communities (Category3and4) with active conservation (and integrated
resource use) on communally owned land of high biodiversity in Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacan.
3. Number of incipient communities (Category I and 2) with increased capacity and willingness to engage in
conservation activities.
4. Institutional frame work at state level to channel resources to communities for their conservation initiatives,
and to support inter-community networking and collaboration on shared conservation goals.
5. Postive market for sustainable use products generated and income increased in communities in high
biodiversity areas without environmental loss.

of the project.9 In its capacity as the financial administrator, the National Financial Agency,
provided an accounting and administrative home to the project and acted as Recipient of the
GEF grant for purposes of the grant legal agreement.

2.23 Project implementation was decentralized to State Committees operating under the
general direction of the National Environment Secretariat (SEMARNAP; subsequently
renamed SEMARNAT). The State Committee comprised three representatives of
participating communities and ejidos, a state representative of the National Environment
Secretariat, a state government representative and civil society representatives. Each State
Committee established a small State Coordination Unit, headed by a State Coordinator
responsible for carrying out the project. The State Committee was responsible for issuing
calls for proposals, evaluating sub-project concepts and approving subproject funding
according to criteria established during Project preparation. The State Committees and the
State Coordination Units initially received technical assistance from the National
Environment Secretariat until 2003, when the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), a
semi-autonomous agency under the Secretariat‟s mandate, assumed this role.

2.24 Responsibility for implementation, programming, and progress was assigned to a
National Oversight Committee, supported by a national coordinator. The National Committee
was to provide oversight of the entire Project, authorize project level annual work programs,
review and authorize the criteria used for selection of sub-projects in each state and authorize
the contracting of consultants for national-level tasks. The National Coordinator was to assist
in establishing the three State Committees and in identifying the State Coordinators. The
National Coordinator was also responsible for monitoring and evaluation, financial reporting,
and carrying out special studies. The National Committee was initially designed to comprise:
(i) three representatives of the communities/ejidos (one from each State Committee); (ii) one
representative of the Environmental Secretariat (SEMARNAT); (iii) one representative of the
National Biodiversity Institute (CONABIO); (iv) one representative of the National Council
for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP); and (v) one representative of the National Forestry
Advisory Group (CONAF). As of 2003, a representative of the National Forestry
Commission (CONAFOR) was included. In 2004 the Committee was expanded to include
representatives of the Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, a
representative of the government of each State participating in the project, and of the
National Financial Agency.




9
 Initially the National Environmental Secretariat (SEMARNAT) was the technical agency responsible for the
project, responsible for forestry issues in Mexico until April 2001, when the National Forestry Commission
(CONAFOR), a semi-autonomous agency under the Secretariat‟s mandate, was created. This resulted in a lack
of clarity and potential overlap of some responsibilities between the two agencies relative to project
management. Rather than delay project implementation until the institutional responsibilities were clarified,
both executing and financing agency responsibilities were assigned to National Financial Agency (NAFIN).

APPROVAL, EFFECTIVENESS, MID-TERM REVIEW, AND CLOSING DATES

3.1    The World Bank‟s Board of Executive Directors approved the project on November
28, 2000, it became effective on June 21, 2001, the mid-term review was carried out on
January 23, 2006, and the operation closed as planned on April 30, 2008.

PLANNED VS. ACTUAL DISBURSEMENTS

3.3     The total cost of the project at appraisal was US$19.05 million; the actual cost was
US$ 24.52 million (28 percent above appraisal, Table 2). It was financed through a GEF
grant of US$ 7.85 million, of which US$7.83 million was disbursed and US $19,860 was
cancelled. The borrower and local government contributed slightly less than the estimate at
appraisal (US$3.9 million and US$3 million respectively at appraisal versus US$2.61 million
each actual), additional funds were provided by foreign sources and through a blended World

AMENDMENTS TO THE GRANT AGREEMENT

3.4     The Grant Agreement (originally dated February 1, 2001) was modified three times
but the project‟s objective was not modified. The first amendment, signed March 2002,
increased the Special Account Allocation to 10% of the value of the grant. 11 The second
amendment, signed in March 2005, redenominated the grant amount from Special Drawing
Rights to United States Dollars, equivalent to the amount originally approved by the GEF.
The agreement was amended for the third time in August 2006 to reflect revisions in the
composition of the National and State Committees and the transfer of technical oversight
responsibilities from Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) to the
National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR); reallocate funds among categories (and
increase their respective disbursement percentage in accordance with country financing
parameters); reflect the mutual agreement by the Bank and Borrower to drop community
venture fund subprojects (Type D investment), as no successful examples had been
developed; and, modify the M&E component to focus on participatory and local monitoring
of natural resource and biodiversity impacts.

FACTORS THAT AFFECTED IMPLEMENTATION

3.5    Project implementation was challenged by three factors: an initial learning curve and
associated disbursement lag, delays in hiring a national coordinator and a request for an



10
  The reasons for the discrepancy between planned vs. actual contributions from the borrower and local
government is not explained in the project‟s files. The category “foreign sources? represents monies leveraged
by NAFIN from other donor funded programs to contribute to the overcommitted amounts for community
subprojects. The specific source of these contributions was not identified.
11
   The special account allocation was increased because the allocation specified in the grant agreement was not
large enough to generate sufficient interest to cover the VAT on already programmed expenditures and the
allocation was not considered to be sufficient for the level of disbursements planned for FY02.

Inspection Panel investigation.12 In the first few years of implementation, disbursements
were low due to changes at the federal and state governments following the December 2000
elections. There was also a learning curve associated with the decentralized project structure
and demand-driven nature of the small grants-scheme, resulting in a 7 to 12 month lag time
between the approval of the subprojects and the release of the first payment to communities.
Time was also needed to help make inroads with the beneficiary communities and gain their
trust. Implementation picked up following the second call for sub-project proposals in 2004
and by 2005 the disbursement lag had been corrected.

3.6     Project implementation was also affected by delays in appointing a National
Coordinator and convening the National Committee. Implementation began in 2001 but the
National Coordinator was not appointed until January 2003 and the National Committee was
not convened until April 2003. The appointment of a National Coordinator was a Condition
of Effectiveness of the Grant. However, as a means to reduce administrative costs, the Bank
waived this condition in the Effectiveness Letter. The Bank team, the National Financial
Agency (NAFIN) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT)
proposed as an alternative to distribute the National Coordinator „s responsibilities among a
newly created liaison for the Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Conservation Project
(COINBIO) and the Mexico Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF), other officers of
the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the State Coordinators,
and other staff already working under the project. The Bank ultimately recognized that the
decision not to hire a National Coordinator left the project without clear central leadership
and the State Coordinators did not have guidance in shaping their respective programs nor a
clear strategy for resource allocation. 13 The process to fill the position was initiated in mid
2002.

3.7    A request for an Inspection Panel investigation into the project further disrupted
implementation. Following the appointment of the National Coordinator, the State
Coordinators in Oaxaca and Guerrero sought to establish the autonomy of their respective
State Committees by advocating that they become independent of the National Financial
Agency (NAFIN), the grant Recipient, and by refusing to communicate directly with the
National Coordinator. At the same time some communities in the state of Oaxaca
complained of a perceived bias against them on the part of the Oaxaca State Committee. 14



12
  The Inspection Panel is an independent, "bottom-up" accountability and recourse mechanism that investigates
World Bank financed projects to determine whether the Bank has complied with its operational policies and
procedures (including social and environmental safeguards), and to address related issues of harm.
13
   The initial investigation of the request for an inspection panel also noted that failure to hire a national
coordinator created a void in the project‟s national and strategic decision making and reduced adequate space
for the processing and resolution of internal conflicts in a legitimate manner.
14
   “During the first round of sub-projects, ninety-one percent of communities in all three States which secured
funding were those with low organizational capacity. This was surprising, as it was expected that the earliest
beneficiaries of the Project would be the communities of the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca where the Project was
conceived and where levels of community organization are high. Indeed, in December 2003, a letter from the
communities of the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca to the Oaxaca State Committee, copied to the World Bank,
complained of bias within the State Committee against their communities.? (Inspection Panel 2004, pg. 6)
                                                      13


The National Financial Agency (NAFIN) subsequently terminated the contracts of the two
coordinators. 15

3.8     On January 26, 2004, representatives from the Oaxaca State Committee filed a
request to investigate the project with the World Bank‟s Inspection Panel. The request
contended that that by proposing to restructure the project and by giving its approval on a “no
objection? basis to the removal of the State Coordinators for Oaxaca and Guerrero without
involving the State Committees, the Bank violated its policies concerning supervision and
indigenous peoples. 16 The Bank Management Response stated that the complaint actually
arose from a labor dispute between an individual and the government, and that the
indigenous policy had not been violated. The project did not go to full inspection. The
Inspection Panel eligibility review concluded that no comment could be made at the time on
the request to investigate the project and encouraged the involved parties work out their
differences and move the project forward. The Panel‟s eligibility report highlighted the high
level of indigenous participation and stating that “…the people of these communities
repeatedly stressed to the Panel that the Project was of great importance to them because it
was driven by their needs and priorities and their definition of conservation. Thus, the Panel
notes the importance of continuing the Project and finding a way to overcome the present
difficulties.?(Inspection Panel 2004) An independent project evaluation was carried out in
2004, and a workshop held to address concerns relative to the structure and management of
the project. In November 2005, the Management Status Report on the action plan that had
been agreed with the Inspection Panel showed that the project had completed all the required
actions. 17

IMPLEMENTATION OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.9    The project‟s key performance indicators were monitored on a regular basis
throughout implementation and incorporated into the Bank‟s corporate reporting system. An


15
   “Management claims that the decision to remove the Coordinators for Oaxaca and Guerrero was based upon
“a track record consisting of: (a) poor management of their responsibilities as State Coordinators, resulting in
low project performance levels; (b) bias in the administration of Project resources with regards to individuals,
communities and sub-regions; and (c) activities that were considered to be undermining and confrontational.
The Response cites a number of examples as justifying the termination: retention by both Coordinators of
individual members on the State Committees although their mandates as community representatives (which
traditionally rotates) had expired, and inviting „„„guests‟ of their choosing? to participate and vote in the
Committee Meetings while excluding others, and, in Oaxaca, calling a large number of meetings that resulted in
substantial operating costs.? (Inspection Panel 2004, pg 9)
16
   “The Requesters (also) state that they requested the removal of the National Coordinator, because they view
him as “persona non grata? among the people, and the reinstatement of the State Coordinators because, in their
opinion, the removal of the two State Coordinators had violated the legal agreements.? (Inspection Panel 2004,
pg. 6)
17
   The items in the action plan were: Issue a statement to recognize the efforts of the ex-State project
Coordinator in Oaxaca (the ex coordinator was also retained as a consultant for 4 months to provide
recommendations relating to community participation methodologies for the project in Oaxaca); hire a new
State Coordinator of Oaxaca; Re-initiate Project Activities in Oaxaca State; select Community Subprojects and
carry out process of Notification to the Communities of the selection; conduct Supervision mission; issue a call
for proposals 2005 for Multi-annual community driven subprojects related to the conservation and sustainable
use of biodiversity.
                                                      14


independent evaluation of the project‟s progress was carried out in the second year of
implementation (2003-3004) and the mid-term review was also carried out in January 2006.

3.10 Construction of the Integrated Information System (SII) was repeatedly delayed and
was only put in place in the project‟s final year of implementation. Its late establishment was
due to several factors, including the delayed hiring of a National Coordinator, 18 and
conflicts between government and Bank procurement rules. The project‟s completion report
also indicates that communities initially resisted monitoring on their lands by outsiders. The
project team eventually overcame this hurdle by including community participation in
development of the system. An additional delay was caused by the difficulty in finding
qualified technical contractors that were also skilled at working with communities.

3.11 The Integrated Information System was ultimately established with a sample of 12
participating communities (four in each participating state). Community monitors were
selected from each sample community. The community monitors participated in design of the
system and gathered information from their respective community. A control group was not
included among the sample communities because it was difficult to find communities willing
to devote the time to participating in data collection when they were not receiving project
benefits. In the State of Guerrero there were difficulties in carrying out M&E in some
communities to due security risks.

3.12 The system comprises contextual data on each community and their involvement with
the project as well as socioeconomic information and data on natural capital found within the
communities territory. Socioeconomic information included official population statistics,
indices on the level of migration, and presence of conflicts and insecurity. Natural capital
data included information on the types of vegetation in the community, a qualitative
assessment of its condition (good, fragmented, or transformed), number of species of flora
and fauna observed in sample plots, and hydrological conditions. The system comprised both
alphanumeric and spatial (GIS) data that was initially posted on a publically accessible
internet page, in accordance with the intermediate indicator specified at project appraisal for
“implementation of SII with internet and local connections and access of information at the
community level information.? 19

3.13 Internal documents raised two data quality issues. The data collected on fauna was
limited by not taking into account the optimal time of day to observe various species and the
failure to select key species to monitor based on their importance to the local ecosystem or
special legal status (i.e. threatened status). The resolution of the digital images was too coarse
to detect changes in vegetation coverage.

3.14 The project also held stakeholder workshops with representatives of the three State
Committees and conducted extensive interviews and field visits with a sample of 15


18
  Bank Management‟s Response to the Inspection Panel request contends that once the National Coordinator
was hired, he was initially prevented from implementing certain project activities, including development of the
biodiversity monitoring scheme, as two of the State Coordinators refused to communicate with him directly.
19
     The website was active until January 2012.
                                                        15


communities (5 in each state)20, between March and May 2008, to provide input to project
completion report.

USE OF DATA

3.15 The key performance indicators were used to gauge implementation progress and
report on final outputs. The initial independent evaluation and the mid-term review provided
the Bank and the Implementing Agency with information that was used to inform changes
made to improve project implementation.21 The Integrated Information System and the
stakeholder workshops provided input to the final completion report.

3.16 Due to the late establishment of the Integrated Information System, the information it
generated could not be used to provide feedback during implementation or to demonstrate
changes in biodiversity by project closure. 22 The project‟s completion report argues that the
system provides a baseline that can be utilized in the future. However, as of the IEG
assessment mission in November 2011, the system had not been used by the National
Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) or the State Agencies, which continue to implement the
program in Oaxaca and Michoacán. The use of the Information System by participating
communities also appears to have been limited. Internal documents note that community use
of the monitoring and evaluation system was limited by the lack of infrastructure in most
communities to access the system and migration of some community monitors in search of
economic opportunities.

SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

3.17 The project was assessed as environmental Category B and triggered four safeguard
policies: Environmental Assessment (4.01), Natural Habitats (4.04), Forestry (4.36) and
Indigenous Peoples (4.20). Application of the safeguards appears to have been adequate.
With respect to Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), the project‟s investments were
relatively small, and focused on conservation or sustainable use of natural resources.
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and state environmental
authorities participated in the project steering committees and screened proposed activities,
which helped to ensure compliance with World Bank safeguards as well as national
standards. In regard to Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), the protection of natural habitats was a

20
  The communities were selected on the basis of their ability to inform the assessment of productive
subprojects. The selection criteria included: productive subprojects that had been in operation for at least a year;
representation of diverse ecosystems (dry forests, temperate forests, and humid forests); and the physical
accessibility and disposition of the community provide information.
21
  These evaluations pointed to several structural issues including tensions between participatory nature of the
project and the administrative operation centralized under the responsibility of a grant recipient organization.
They also noted the void in strategic direction due to the lack of National Coordinator and recommended that
the project strengthen management and accountability role of the National Coordinator; define more clearly the
functions of the State Coordinator and place this position within a chain of command subordinate to the national
Coordinator; and expand membership of the state committee to include other institutionally important players.
The lack of progress in building a database to measure protected biodiversity and enhanced community capacity
was also noted. The structural recommendations were reflected in the 2006 amendment to the grant agreement.
22
     The system was to generate both baseline data and follow up data over the course of project implementation.
                                                     16


major focus of the project. Over 166,000 hectares of natural habitats were put under
community conservation management. In addition, over 156,000 hectares of additional
adjacent lands were subject to improved natural resources planning and management. The
Forestry safeguard (O.P. 4.46), was triggered due to the fact that project design included
forest utilization through sustainable forest management subprojects, small-scale agro
forestry, or non-timber forest products. However, few sub-projects were supported with
forestry activities and all were in compliance with the safeguard. The project itself was
designed as an indigenous people‟s project; its core strategy was to incorporate indigenous
peoples in the establishment and management of new protected areas. In addition, the Bank
incorporated provisions of the Indigenous Peoples Policy (4.20) into the project‟s social
assessment during design.

FIDUCIARY ISSUES

3.18 The project had no significant fiduciary or procurement issues. An external private
firm audited the project annually. The National Financial Agency (NAFIN) submitted
semiannual project Progress Reports to the Bank, which included a financial management
section. The final fiduciary management mission concluded that financial management risk
was modest. A minor weakness identified in financial management was the lack of an
integrated system to facilitate NAFIN‟s operation as both financial agent and executing
agency, but this was deemed negligible and did not prevent the timely and reliable provision
of information required to manage and monitor the implementation of the project. Three ex-
post procurement reviews were conducted, confirming that procurement in the Project was
being handled in accordance with the agreed procedures, and no cases of mis-procurement
occurred.



4. Achievement of the Objective: Conserve High
Biodiversity by Strengthening and Promoting Community
Conservation Initiatives on Communally-Owned Lands
4.1    Achievement of the project objective of conserving biodiversity is reviewed from two
aspects: achievements in terms establishing an institutional model to support community
conservation, and the outputs and outcomes from the community subprojects.

Institutional Model
4.2      The project established an institutional mechanism at the State level that provides
communities with tools and resources to facilitate land use decisions in favor of biodiversity
conservation. At the time of the assessment mission, over three years after completion of the
pilot, the COINBIO program continues to finance a community-driven small grants program
with funding secured from federal and state government in two of the three pilot states. 23
23
  The state of Guerrero did not invest in the program beyond the pilot phase due to a change of government
administration, coupled with increased insecurity in the state.
                                                17


The State Committees have been retained with the same composition of actors and continue
to meet on a monthly basis to provide oversight. The state coordination units established
under the project have been absorbed into state government agencies: in the State of
Michoacán the COINBIO program is now administered through the State Secretary of Urban
and Environment and in the state of Oaxaca the program is administered by the State Institute
of Ecology. The National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) continues to provide technical
supervision. At the time of the assessment mission, CONAFOR officials reported to IEG that
discussions were ongoing with state government officials to establish a new COINBIO
program in the state of Puebla.

4.3     At the national level, the National Forestry Commission has incorporated the
provision of support for the establishment of community conservation into its community
forestry program, which is national in scope. The project also contributed to legitimizing
community conservation initiatives through its role in the modification of national
environmental legislation. The project experience (along with a UNDP-implemented GEF
project and the Bank-supported Meso-American Biological Corridor Project) is credited with
contributing to the government‟s decision to revise the General Law on Ecological Balance
and Environmental Protection to formally recognize Community Conservation Areas as
category of protection within the national protected areas system.

Community Level Outputs and Outcomes
4.4     Over the course of project implementation, the project implemented three subproject
cycles, funding 489 subprojects in 205 communities. The breakdown of subprojects by
investment type is presented in Table 3.

4.5     Most of the subprojects financed capacity building and planning activities such as
training, feasibility studies, inventories, and mapping. A smaller portion financed physical or
productive investments. Category A subprojects financed participatory planning and mapping
exercises, scientific studies, and flora and fauna inventories. Category B subprojects
supported training and capacity building workshops, including community to community
“horizontal exchanges? led by more advanced communities. The breakdown between
planning / preparation and investment activities financed through Categories C(a) and C(b) is
not clear. According to the information in the SII system, Category C(a) Sustainable Use
                                                    18


Sub-projects included studies that generate technical knowledge to help communities make
decisions about the sustainable use of their natural resources. Category C(b) Productive
Conservation Sub-projects included investments in conservation or sustainable uses, and
investments in roads, vigilance towers, and fire control, implying that C(a) solely funded
studies and planning and only category C(b)-funded actual investment activities. However,
the project‟s completion report states that “the nature of the activities funded under
Component II, and in particular under the category C(b), “productive conservation sub-
projects? were mainly capacity-building workshops, studies, development of plans
(sustainable management, territorial development plans, among others), delimitation of
territories, some were infrastructural projects such as: protection of water sheds, ecotourism,
etc.?

4.6      Capacity outputs/outcomes. The project completion report notes that a total of 152
communities were reached through community-to-community seminars, workshops, training
courses, and other activities (against a target of 150) and that 77 incipient communities
(categories 1 and 2) participated in capacity building and conservation related themes,
increasing their capacity and interest to carry out conservation activities (surpassing the
target of 70 communities), Incipient communities contributed 10 to 20% of the financing for
the beneficiary training and the project team reports that participation was considered good
overall. However, the extent to which that capacity was enhanced is unclear, as both
indicators measure participation but not the extent to which capacity was increased as a
result. Sixty-four organizationally advanced communities (category 3 and 4) were reported to
have active conservation (and integrated resources use) on communally owned land of high
biodiversity (short of the target of 70 communities), defined as having an organization in
place, trained, or with approved management plans.

4.7     Land use plan outputs/outcomes. A key output of the community subprojects was
to increase the number of hectares officially designated by the community as a conservation
area or sustainable land use areas. Project documents and interviews with beneficiaries
during the assessment mission indicate that the studies, inventories and land use planning
exercises contributed to communities‟ decision to designate conservation and sustainable
land use areas in at least two ways. In some communities the information raised awareness of
the conservation value of the natural resources harbored on in their territory. In others there
was interest in maintaining a portion of their territory with minimum human impact even
prior to the project (for example, reservoirs of medicinal plants and seeds, protection of water
sources, and sacred sites), but the inventories and land use plans allowed communities to
decide where to place conservation areas based on scientific knowledge.

4.8    A total of 78 community conservation areas24 were established and are estimated to
cover 166,776 hectares, surpassing the project target of 150,000 hectares by 11 percent. This
estimate was based on the assumption that on average of 20 percent of communities that
developed community zoning plans would fall under the conservation area. An additional

24
   Community Conservation Areas are sites of intact or recovering vegetation on private communally owned
lands, which are designated by the community for long term conservation. The decision to establish a
conservation area is endorsed by the communal assembly and codified within formal community by-laws,
statutes, or other legally binding community documents, and is enforceable by the community government.
                                                     19


156,206 hectares25 of community land were estimated to have been designated for
sustainable land use26 (surpassing the 150,000 hectare target by 9 percent).

4.9     Land use plans were developed in 248 communities (falling short of the 300 target). It
is not clear whether this number includes the 78 communities in which conservation areas
were established. The project‟s completion report notes that prior to the project less than 8
percent of communal land in the target area was under some form of conservation against an
assumed 20 percent at closing. However, the extent to which land use plans are being
implemented and the extent to which these areas increased biodiversity conservation are
unknown.

4.10 Productive investment outputs/outcomes. An expected intermediate outcome was
the generation of “markets for green/sustainable use products and increased income in
communities in high biodiversity areas without environmental loss.? Income was not
measured because few productive subprojects that created commercial enterprises had
generated returns by project closure. It is also unclear how many of the productive subproject
investments resulted in a functioning enterprises. The COINBIO subproject grants were
relatively small and were often used to co financed enterprises with funds leveraged from a
variety of government programs. Some communities interviewed at project closure and by
the IEG mission had obtained subproject funding for investments intended to contribute to
the establishment of a productive enterprise but additional investments were required for the
enterprise to become operational.

4.11 With respect to generating green product markets, the project completion report notes
that that few subprojects had reached a stage of generating a market for their products in the
short time that they had been operating. Project documents highlight a few communities that
did open new markets. One example is the production of organic hibiscus flower. The
technical service provider contracted by the project played a key role in identifying a niche
market opportunity for a community engaged in hibiscus production by switching from
conventional to organic production, eliminating intermediaries, and obtaining organic
certification. Before the project sold a ton of hibiscus sold for 28,000 Mexican Pesos; after
obtaining organic certification it sold for 55,000 Pesos per ton.

4.12 Biodiversity outcomes. There is no evidence on the extent to which the approach
piloted by the project resulted in increased conservation of biodiversity. The monitoring of
biodiversity was not carried out until the final year of the project and there has been no
further monitoring in the three years since the project closed.

  The number of hectares under sustainable use was estimated based on the assumption that on average 25% of
communities‟ territory would be under falls under sustainable use. The communities included in this estimate
were: communities with agro forestry activities, those with functioning wildlife management areas,
communities that five or more COINBIO subprojects that financed activities related to the sustainable use of
their territory.
26
  The specific uses permitted and restrictions are determined by each individual community and incorporated in
land use plans.

4.13 It is likely that the areas that were placed under conservation or sustainable land use
harbor biodiversity of interest to the international conservation community as all eligible
communities were located in zones that were categorized as high-priority areas for
biodiversity conservation at project appraisal. The monitoring activities carried out in the
final year of implementation found that 22 percent of the surface area of the participating
communities total territory fell within areas considered by Bird Life International as
important for global bird conservation, though it is not clear if the portion of the territory
designated for conservation falls within this region. The project completion report also notes
that, floristic inventories conducted through community subprojects and independent
research projects carried out on beneficiaries territory reported 15 endemic species of reptiles
and a new plant species, Heteroflorum sclerocarpum, was discovered in the Balsas Dry
Forest region of two participating communities. Project documents highlight some cases of
neighboring communities that have set aside contiguous areas for conservation, particularly
areas with border conflicts. Six communities have agreements to a biological corridor in
which Jaguars are reportedly protected.

4.14 However, the contribution of conservation areas and sustainable land use areas to
biodiversity conservation depends upon enforcement of land use plans, and whether the
actions within them are sufficient to mitigate against threats. Due to the demand nature of the
project, the project did not identify upfront specific species intended to be conserved or
indicate a plan for their recovery. It did not collate individual communities‟ conservation
objectives for the full set of subprojects, and the implementation of land use plans was not
measured. Finally, the extent to which productive enterprises are serving as an incentive to
prevent communities from converting land to agriculture is unclear as few of the productive
subprojects have resulted in a revenue generating enterprise.

4.15 The project completion report notes that the project is considered a good practice
example. Similar approaches have been implemented in Mexico and elsewhere on the
presumption that it is effective. But the evidence has not been gathered to demonstrate the
extent to which this operation has resulted in better conservation of biodiversity by
participating communities, and this was the objective.27



5. Efficiency
5.1     Economic rate of return analysis. Economic and financial analysis was not carried
out during project preparation due to the project‟s focus on biodiversity conservation. An
incremental cost analysis was prepared at appraisal to satisfy the GEF requirement in place at
the time. The difference between the cost of the Baseline Scenario (US$21.2 million) and the
cost of the GEF Alternative28 (US$28.7 million) was estimated at US$7.5 million. The

27
  Studies conducted in Mexico and other countries have shown that community conservation can result in
improved biodiversity outcomes but it is not clear if this was the case in the areas covered by this project.
28
  At the time of appraisal GEF project approval requirements included a calculation of incremental costs. The
methodology for determining incremental costs depends on defining (i) a “baseline? which comprises national
activities already being undertaken to achieve the aims of the project under development, and (ii) an
                                                       21


incremental cost analysis was not repeated at project closure because GEF had dropped this
requirement by that time.

5.2     An ex post economic analysis was conducted as part of the project‟s completion
report which estimated the overall project‟s net present value (NPV) at US$ 4.255 million
and an economic rate of return (ERR) at 26.9 percent based on the potential incremental
benefit of environmental service payments/ha29 for all 166,776 ha declared as conservation
areas under the project. The ERR dropped to 11.7 percent if only 66 percent of the hectares
within conservation areas received environmental service payments. The higher ERR
calculation seems unlikely, as it assumes that the entire area placed under conservation by the
project would receive environmental service payments. The project completion report does
not specify the number of COINBIO communities that were receiving environmental
services contracts at the time of project closure and IEG was not able to determine how many
of the conservation areas supported by the project had received environmental service
payments at the time of the assessment mission.30

5.3      The project completion report also presented financial analysis of individual
illustrative case studies of four of the 489 subprojects (productive activities were chosen).
The financial rates of return of the chosen subprojects were calculated as (1) 17.8 percent for
the ecotourism project; (2) 23.4 percent for the community water bottling enterprise; (3) 12.7
percent for the production and harvesting of medicinal plants and (4) 12.5 percent for the
sustainable deer rearing scheme. It is not clear, however, how representative these examples
are of the population of projects that attempted to create productive enterprises. The project
completion report notes that the cases were selected on the basis of the few subproject
investments that had generated income by project closure, and these subprojects had not yet
reached full cost-recovery. It was not possible to determine how many of the productive
subprojects resulted in the establishment of operational enterprises or how many remained
financially viable at the time of the IEG assessment mission.

5.4     Cost effectiveness analysis. The project completion report attempted to provide a
least- cost analysis of the COINBIO model as a means to establish conservation areas. The
cost of creating a community conservation area under COINBIO was estimated to be
US$49/hectare. The time required for a community to establish conservation areas was 50
days spread over a total time period of 165-175 days. An appropriate comparator, however,
could not be identified because the project was the first of its kind and few credible datasets


alternative? scenario which is the set of actions needed to achieve global environmental benefits. The alternative
scenario is, essentially, the proposed project – of which the incremental costs will be funded by the GEF.
29
  The payment for environmental services program is a government program that provides five year‟s worth of
payments to communities that can be shown, through regular, independent inspection, to have complied with
the requirement to set aside and protect blocks of forestland for conservation. The program pays US$34/hectare,
which represents the opportunity cost of planting 1 hectare of maize in the area of Mexico City.
30
  The payment for environmental services program and COINBIO are two separate programs and a systematic
analysis of the communities participating in both programs has not been done. Four of the eight communities
visited by the IEG mission reported that they were receiving environmental service payments. Only two of the
15 communities that participated in stakeholder workshops at project closure reported that they had
Environmental Service contract.
                                               22


exist on the costs of establishing protected areas. The Mexico National Protected Area
system invests US$3/ha to bring an area under conservation. IEG agrees with the completion
report‟s conclusion that this is not a good comparator to the community model, as most of
Mexico‟s parks are private holdings with land-use restrictions, and many of them are not
managed. The COINBIO model, in contrast, involves higher levels of participation and
commitment than traditional park management models, and includes investments in
strengthening social capital to achieve conservation and mainstreaming into the community‟s
legal framework. Another potential comparator is Mexico‟s Payment for Environmental
Service program which pays US$34 per hectare per year for a contract of five years.
However, the two programs are not mutually exclusive and some communities participate in
both programs. The completion report also cited a GEF-financed project in Argentina which
invested on average 43 US$/ha to develop traditional national parks but it is not clear how
comparable Argentina‟s conditions are to Mexico. IEG was also unable to encounter figures
on establishing community conservation models in other countries. Despite the limitation a
lack of comparator imposes on assessing the cost-effectiveness of this operation, the project
team‟s attempt to analyze the cost of establishing community conservation areas under the
COINBIO model, may be a useful baseline for future operations.

5.5      Other important aspects taken into account when assessing the efficiency of any
operation are efficiencies in the use of project resources, efficiencies in design, and in
implementation. A positive indication of project management efficiency is that the project
disbursed in full and closed on schedule, meeting or exceeding its output targets, in spite of
the initial disbursement lag and implementation disruptions in the initial years of the project.
On the other hand, total project cost exceeded the appraisal estimate by 28 percent, due in
part to the over-commitment of community subprojects. Finally, it is difficult to assess the
efficiency of the investments without knowing whether they were in fact effective in
conserving biodiversity.

5.6    On balance efficiency is rated as modest.



6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     This was the first attempt by GEF and the Bank to engage local communities in
biodiversity conservation. The project‟s objective was highly relevant to the Bank‟s
assistance strategies in place at appraisal and project closure, as well as to the country‟s
environmental priorities and its Biodiversity Strategy. Relevance of the project design,
however, was modest. Its institutional design and participatory approach were in line with the
prevailing tenure structure and the country‟s efforts to decentralization natural resources
management but it lacked a clearly articulated results chain. The project met or exceeded
most of its outputs and created a structure at the State level that continues to function in two
states 3 years after project closure. However, due to weaknesses in the design and
implementation of the M&E system, there is no baseline measurement of biodiversity at the
                                                                 23


project‟s inception and no basis on which to assess changes in biodiversity. The resulting
outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.2       Risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

6.3      The risk to sustainability of the institutional arrangement is contingent on the political
will of the State Government to allocate state budget resources each year and solicit matching
funds from the federal government. At the time of the IEG assessment mission, three years
after project closure, the COINBIO program continues to receive budget allocations from
both state and federal government in the two states in which the model has been
institutionalized (Table 4). Representatives of State Government indicated to IEG that
biodiversity conservation is a high priority for government in both states. Government
representatives in Michoacán noted that the COINBIO program is considered an important
instrument for operationalizing the state‟s recent Biodiversity Strategy.

a. Resources for the program were not obtained in 2011 due to bureaucratic bottlenecks associated with a change in government
administration that year. However, the project continued to operate in 2011 with resources remaining from the previous year.


6.4     Data were not available to assess how many of the community conservation and
sustainable use areas established under the project remained under protection at the time of
the IEG assessment. However, some communities participate in other government programs
that are subject to independent verification. One program is the National Commission of
Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) voluntary registry of community conservation reserves.
IEG‟s review of the CONANP database found 20 of the participating communities have
certified their conservation areas through this program. In addition, some communities have
obtained environmental service contracts under Mexico‟s Payment for Environmental
Services Program. The payments received from this program provide an additional incentive
for participating communities to maintain conservation areas. The IEG mission was unable to
obtain an exact number of the COINBIO beneficiary communities that have obtained
environmental service contracts.

6.5     Sustainability also depends on the interest and capacity of community to implement
their land use plans and enforce land use restrictions, neither of which has been monitored.
The specific threats to biodiversity and measures to mitigate them and level of enforcement
vary by community. The beneficiary workshops carried out at the end of the project indicate
that some communities had organized vigilance patrols or fire brigades to guard against fires,
                                                      24


unauthorized extraction of wood and hunting. Some also had agreements with neighboring
communities as an added measure of enforcement. Others did not have such arrangements.
The extent of community buy-in and interest in the project was also found to vary. With
some communities reporting a sense of apathy among the broader population with respect to
project supported activities, in some cases opposition of some community members was
noted.

6.6     The sustainability of productive subprojects financed under the project is less certain.
The project‟s completion report notes that at project closure few productive enterprises had
broken even and there has been no follow up monitoring to determine the number of
enterprises that survive today.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

6.7      Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The
project was designed through a phased approach, initially responding to a request from
communities in Oaxaca with the use of Block A grant financing to prepare a medium-size
GEF project31 in Oaxaca. After having gained strong support from the Ministry of
Environment, Natural Resources, and Fishery, the government proposed that it be rolled out
across other states, through the request of a Full Size project. In designing the project, the
Bank team drew on lessons learned from the Bank‟s Community Forestry Project
Management project, which was under implementation at time that the project was being
designed. Also, based on lessons learned for GEF‟s 1999 Performance Implementation
Review (PIR) that encouraged biodiversity conservation projects to build adaptive
management into their design; COINBIO targeted project activities to the organizational
capacity of the communities, introducing progressive grant financing and incentivizing
matching resources. Finally, the project was designed to complement other programs such as
the Bank-financed Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF) and the UNDP executed
GEF-implemented forest project (PRODERS). The former focused on production forestry
rather than conservation and the latter focused on tropical forests, while COINBIO focused
on temperate forests. Moreover, PRODERS concentrated more on reducing pressures on
forest and protected areas through building the sustainable production capacity of rural
producers, as opposed to establishing community conservation areas.

6.8     A shortcoming in quality at entry was the decision to waive hiring of National
Coordinator as a condition of effectiveness. There was also a discrepancy between the
Operational Manual and the loan agreement, which contributed to the crisis with State
Coordinators. The disbursement plan was out of step with learning curve often associated
with participatory approaches. The decentralized project structure and demand driven nature
of the small grants-scheme, contributed to the 7 to 12 month lag time between the approval


31
  GEF medium-sized projects are smaller in scale than full-sized projects and follow expedited procedures for
their approval. By funding such projects GEF aims to increase flexibility in allocating its resources and
encourages a wide range of stakeholders to propose and develop project concepts.
                                              25


of the subprojects and the release of the first payment to communities. Finally, baseline data
was not established until the final year of the project.

SUPERVISION

6.9     The Bank‟s performance during supervision was moderately satisfactory. Supervision
missions were carried out 2-3 times per year and the information gathered from the M&E
system was used to measure implementation progress. In the course of supervision the Bank
recognized that the failure to hire a National Coordinator or convene a National Committee
during the start up phase of the project was impeding implementation and took corrective
measures to address it. A number of measures were taken to improve implementation. The
investigation of the request for an inspection panel revealed that in the initial years of
implementation there were some execution issues that the Bank had not addressed in a timely
manner, such as a lack of essential supplies for Oaxaca's coordination unit to perform its
duties, including a vehicle to reach indigenous communities, and other office materials. That
said, through good supervision, Bank staff brought the project back on track, a factor that
was responsible for the project not being recommended for full inspection. However, along
with the Borrower, the Bank is faulted with the late establishment of the SII system to
measure biodiversity outcomes, as a result of which the efficacy of the project‟s approach to
conserving biodiversity remains unknown.

6.10   Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

6.11 Government Performance is rated satisfactory on balance. The Secretary of
Environment was supportive of the project since its preparation, as the approach fit the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources‟ (SEMARNAT‟s) strategies that sought to
decentralize environmental management. While the project originated at the local level with
a request from the communities in Oaxaca state, the Secretary of Environment ultimately
requested that the effort be scaled up to a full sized project. Actual counterpart financing
from the federal government was slightly less than what was anticipated at project appraisal.
Following the change in technical oversight from the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources (SEMARNAT) to the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), the latter
financed the taxes on goods and services for the project from its own resources, since these
expenditures could not be financed out of GEF Grant proceeds. The government has
continued to make funds available for the program following project closure.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

6.12 Implementing Agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The National
Financial Agency (NAFIN), the implementing agency, adequately administered the grant and
complied with Bank fiduciary and safeguards procedures. However, the implementing
agency shares responsibility with the Bank for the delay in hiring a National Coordinator and
the failure to establish a critical component of the project‟s M&E system until the final year
                                              26


of project implementation, as the result of which it remains uncertain as to whether the entire
approach has been effective in conserving biodiversity. In addition, the inspection panel
eligibility report noted that the manner in which NAFIN handled the termination of contracts
of State Coordinators contributed to the conflict with some of the State Committees
culminating in the project being referred for investigation. Following the inspection panel
review, however, the implementing agency and project management team adequately
addressed implementation challenges and ensured that the project finished on time meeting
most of its output targets.

6.13   Overall Borrower Performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.20 Design. Key performance indicators and numerical targets were defined at appraisal,
although most were output rather than outcome indicators. Project design also including a
dedicated M&E component to monitor changes in biodiversity overtime, capture socio-
economic data, and conduct participatory evaluation studies to document social
organizational processes. Evaluations were planned for the end of the second and fourth
years of implementation, to review implementation mechanisms and highlight any
adjustments needed to the criteria and procedures in the operational manual, targets and the
distribution of sub-grant activities among the different types of participating communities.

3.7     Implementation. The key performance indicators were monitored on a regular basis
throughout implementation. The independent evaluation in the second year of
implementation and the mid-term review were carried out as planned. However, construction
of the Integrated Information System was repeatedly delayed and was only put in place in the
project‟s final year of implementation and there were some limitations in the quality of its
data.

6.14 Utilization. The key performance indicators were used to gauge implementation
progress but because the Integrated Information System was only put in place in the final
year of the project, it was not utilized to provide feedback during implementation nor was it
able to capture changes in biodiversity by over the life of the project. The information
generated by the system was intended to provide a baseline to measure changes in
biodiversity and social capital moving forward but no provisions were made to ensure long
term monitoring. As of the IEG assessment mission no follow up survey has been carried out
to assess changes in biodiversity. The use of the system by participating communities was
also limited.

6.15   Overall the quality of Monitoring and Evaluation is rated modest.
                                                27


7. Lessons
7.1      The lack of a common understanding of the respective roles and level of
autonomy of all parties in a decentralized management structure can undermine
implementation. In this case differences in interpretation of the level of autonomy delegated
to state level actors contributed to an impasse between some of the state coordination units
and the national implementing agency that threatened to end project implementation and
contributed to an inspection panel request. Eventually these issues were resolved, but the
experience highlights the importance of taking explicit measures during implementation to
ensure that all parties are on the same page.

7.2    The project’s experience reveals the challenges associated with developing
monitoring tools that are adequate for both conservation and capacity building
objectives. Participatory monitoring is important for enhancing community capacity to
monitor and make decisions over the management of their natural resources. Measuring
conservation outcomes may require ecosystem-level analysis. One tool or approach may not
be adequate for both objectives. .

7.3     The project’s experience in carrying out participatory monitoring demonstrates
the need to employ methods that are useful to communities and can be continued
beyond the project’s closure. While community participation was included in the
monitoring exercise, the methods used were out of step with the communities‟ capacity to
continue monitoring over the long term. This experience points to the need to ensure that
communities are provided with adequate incentives and support for monitoring over the long
run.

7.4     A recurring shortcoming in the implementation of small grant type projects is
the failure to monitor subproject outcomes. Since the demand-driven nature of
participatory operations like this one limits the ability to specify objectives of sub-projects.
up-front extra effort is required in the course of implementation to document the goals
communities for themselves, their plan for achieving these goals, and to monitor resulting
outcomes.
