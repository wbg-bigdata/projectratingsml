PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA: FIRST NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
(Credit 495-TA)
PREFACE
Credit 495-TA for the First National Sites and Services Project
was signed in July, 1974.   The Credit,  for US$8.5 million, was fully
disbursed in October, 1981. During implementation, the project's content
was revised and the closing date was postponed.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Water
and Urban Division of the Eastern Africa Projects Department. It is based
on a review of files and documents, interviews with Bank and Borrower staff
and a visit to Tanzania in September, 1981.
In accordance with the revised procedures for the project
performance audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by
OED staff. The draft Completion Report was sent to the Borrower and its
agencies. Their comments have been reflected in the PCR and are reproduced
as an annex.

1/  The total project cost in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) differed
from the amount implied by the Credit amount and disbursement
percentages. The total project cost has therefore been revised
downwards from 16.7 US$ million equivalent to 14.5 US$million
equivalent. The Tanzanian Housing Bank's (THB) home loan disbursements
were erroneously stated as being TSh.45,000,000 in the SAR. According
to thc Development Credit Agreement, US$ equivalent of 2,000,000 was
provided for THB loans. The Association was to finance 50% of the
amount disbursed, hence the TSh. amount that was to have been disbursed
by the THB should have been TSh.28,560,000 (US$4,000,000 equivalent).
2, The project scope and content were changed during implementation.
Although the total amount actually spent on the project increased by
only 6%, the cost per serviced s-te increased 15% (from TSh.3,020 to
TSh.3,480). The number of units was therefore trimmed back from 10,600
planned to 8,500 actual. Upgrading costs per unit, on the other hand,
came in 15% below that expected (from TSh.1,810 per house to only
TSH.1,550) due to there being more houses than expected in the upgraded
areas. Fully 14,600 houses benefitted, compared to 8,800 estimated at
appraisal.

_/ Total as of 3/83. Eigrty-thwee plots in Sina and 20 plots in Kijitnyama were xt
developed due to the alignnt of a wter mn                tely 150 plots in Sinza and 200
plots In Kijitoyama were oDt developed because of unforeseen tecimical proble. The
development of 881 plots in M[koche was deferred in order to avoid cost overruns.
2/ The development of 498 plots ms deferred to accomondate cost overrus.
S/ Seven plots found to be unsuitable for developmeat; secticx of 243 plots squatted upon and
4   43 intermingled with squatters.
4/ Population increased as a result of densification during the iuplemtation period.
31 To habitable stage. Data for Dar es Salaam is as of 2/82 4threas data for Nxbya and Hmza
is as of 8/81. Between 8/81 and 2/82, the nuber of units occupIed In Dar es Salaam
increased by 38% hence figure for Nbeya and MEmnza (345) is Likely to be below the actual.
The data Is being upiated by the Towa Cauncils.
6/ IS conmwnty education centers, one dispensary, one large maiket and one minor micket
deleted from comnmity facllities component to avoid coet overnmms.
7/ IHB's house loan disbursements were erroneously stated as being TSh.45,00O,000 ILn the
Staff Appraisal Report. Accordlg to the Dyeopmmat Credit Agremaent, US$ equivaeLmt
2,000,000 uss provided for THB house loans. The Aswciation was to finance 50Z of the
am=unt disbursed, hence the TSh. amonit that ms to have bemi disbursed by the THB should
have been TSh.28,560,000 (US$4,000,000 equidvalet). The fwids provided for the THB in the
project therefore 'as only enaough to cover about 60% of the mwbier of loms indicated above
as the appraisal estimate.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA: First National Sites and Services Project
HIGHLIGHTS
The first National Sites and Services Project was one of the
first such projects to be funded by the Association and represented the
first demonstration phase of Tanzania's program to deliver housing and
services to the country's low-income majority.  The project included the
development of newly serviced plots in three urban centers; improvement to
basic infrastructure and additional services to existing squatter settle-
ments in two of the three urban centers; community facilities; consultants'
services for the design and detailed engineering of basic infrastructure,
project supervision and the preparation of a follow-up project; expansion
of physical facilities for a town planning training program; monitoring and
evaluation; a pilot nutrition project; training for technical staff of the
Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi); financing for
house construction and improvement loans; and equipment and vehicles.
The implementation period proved to be a very difficult one as
the economy deteriorated following the increase in international prices in
1974, the collapse of the East African Community in early 1977 and the war
with Uganda in 1978-79.   There were widespread shortages; delays in the
import of equipment and spare parts and rapid inflation.  The environment
was a very difficult one to operate within. The Government also changed
the institutional structure. Urban councils were recreated in 1978, after
having being abolished in 1972. The difficulties in the institutional and
economic environment and the newness of the approach resulted in a two-year
delay in completion. The project as completed was alro somewhat changed in
scope and content.
It is perhaps noteworthy and not atypical of first generation
urban projects that the civil works or physical component went more smooth-
ly than the 'software' elements. Greater difficulties were encountered in
developing an adequate community development support network, initiating
cost recovery, and in sustaining an adequate level of infrastructure
maintenance.
Cost recovery was perhaps the primary issue of project implemen-
tation. The mid-stream shift after appriisal from one vehicle (direct plot
charges) to another (property taxes) inevitably involved a second round of
political approvals. Once secured, it took much longer than expected to
complete the subsequent mechanics of house registration, tax roll
preparation, and the hiring and training of collections staff.   Thus a
three year lag occurred between completion of services in upgraded areas
and start-up of cost recovery.



-ix-
A principal objective of the project was the establishment of a
cadre of professionals capable of implementing a program based on modest
standards and a self-help approach to shelter and services.  The project
achieved this. It did not, however, develop a functional shelter delivery
system.   Upgrading was successfuly done by one agency-Ardhi.   Serviced
sites, however, require the cooperative (-systemic") efforts of several
institutioas for completion and fragmented responsibilities made it
difficult to pinpoint and resolve bottlenecks.
Low civil service salaries and high staff turnover were also
endemic problems in Tanzania. The resulting morale problems were exacer-
bated by a rising general level of corruption which parallelled the
country's economic deterioration.   All this made the task of project
management exceptionally difficult-even had the institutional structure
been more workable from the start.
The Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) proved a particularly disap-
pointing intermediary. The THEB suffered generaliy, like many Tanzanian in-
stitutions, from too-rapid expansion and weak financial management. Staff
turnover was unusually high, loan procedures remained cumbersome, outreach
was weak, reporting unsatisfactory, and financial performance poor.
Interest rates were quite negative in real terms and discouraged lending to
the poor while contributing to the agency's decapitalization.   THEB did,
however, successfully initiate lending to lowest income groups. Fully 5OZ
of all loans made by 1978 were to families below the established TSh. 750
monthly income ceiling. Upgrading of squatter dwellings was initiated for
the first time in the Housing Bank's history-no small accomplishment in
itself. Such policy breakthroughs are not easily achieved.
Treasury's performance in collecting charges for serviced plots
and particularly upgrading areas has been a bright spot of institutional
competency. The task has been successfully managed from its outset in 1980
and the agexcy seems somehow to have overcome the pervasive headaches
created by overall country conditions.  Collection administration startup
costs were about 10% of total collections .
In sum, an important start has been made on institutional
development. Greater accountability is needed in the shelter delivery side
and a longer time frame than one project is necessary to achieve
significant progress. Implementation capacity remains thinly stretched and
lending operations must be carefully matched to this capacity.   Greater
attention is needed in future project preparation and appraisal to the
institutional aspect.



Over 200,000 people benefited from the project-a substantial
increase over that estimated at appraisal-85Z of whom lived in upgraded
areas. Based on THB's figures, perhaps half the serviced site recipients
were within the targetted population of TShs.750 and below.  Thus, while
there was some poaching of plots by higher income groups, over 70X of proj-
ect beneficiaries appear to be within the targetted population. The proj-
ect did therefore reach the poor.
Health and educational levels in squatter areas certainly
improved.  Though this, of course, is hard to quantify.  Rates of return
offer more quantifiable benefits, and actually exceeded expectations at
appraisal.   Serviced sites show a return of between 16-20X--versus an
estimated 10.4%, and upgrading fully 33Z-over double the expected 14.5%.
These figures largely reflect the increasing scarcity value of shelter in
Tanzania.
It is our conclusion that the project achieved its basic demon-
stration impact and successfully helped Tanzania translate policy into
action. Upgrading was more successful than serviced plots. Weaknesses in
the institutional delivery system is the key problem in plot development,
specifically in plot allocation, house loans, and community development
followup.   Cost recovery, though hard-won, has proven workable.   It is
perhaps surprising that achievement of the project's basic objectives did
not founder on the institutional weaknesses and increasing adversity of
country conditions.  The changes made during implementation, however, did
not compromise the principal goals of demonstrating a workable approach to
providing houses and services to the urban poor and creating some capacity
to undertake similar projects in the future.
The first project has made an important beginning. Perhaps one
of its major achievements has been as a diagnostic tool giving us a
practical working knowledge of the Tanzanian urban environment, and helping
pinpoint some of the underlying problems needing attention in subsequent
phases of urban lending.
Aspects of the project implementation experience that may be of
special interest are:
-    the  difficulties  and  time  needed  to  have  changes  to
regulations and established procedures effected (PCR,
paras. 2.09, 3.10, 3.12, 3.13, 4.17, 4.19, 4.20, 4.24-4.27);
-    the importance of a programmatic approach extending beyond
the project period (PCR, para. 3.19, 4.02, 4.19, 4.20, 6.16,
8.03);
-    the need for clear assignment of accountability (PCR, paras.
6.12, 8.06).



TANZANIA: FIRST SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Sector Background
1.01        At the time of project identification in 1972 although the
absolute number of urban dwellers in Tanzania was relatively small, about
900,000 or approximately 6.5Z of a total population of 14.0 million, the
rate of urbanization was steadily climbing. Between 1957 and 1967, the ten
principal regional centers grew at an average annual rate of 6.5%, which
was nearly two and one-half times the national rate. It was foreseen that,
if the existing trends continued, Tanzania's urban population would double
in 11 years and that Dar es Salaam would reach 1.0 million by 1983. A
by-product of these high rates of urbanization was a severe nationwide
housing shortage, particularly among the nearly 80% of the urban households
in Dar es Salaam then earning less than TSh.500 per month.
1.02       In 1969, over 40% of the housing containing an estimated 65Z of
Dar es Salaam's  population was located  in squatter areas.   Municipal
services were practically non existent due to insufficient funds and
equipment and a shortage of trained manpower. Over 80% of the households
were tenants, of which approximately 90% lived in single rooms. Only about
25% of Dar es Salaam's households had piped water to their plots, another
38% had access to water from kiosks and the rest (37%) had no access to
piped water.   Nearly 73% of the houses were without electricity.   The
situation in the other urban centers, although not as well quantified, was
similar.
1.03       In order to cope with the abovementioned problems the Government
of Tanzania had adopted a decentralization policy to divert growth away
from Dar es Salaam into the other urban centers and rural areas.
The decentralization policy involved (a) the abolition of urban councils,
(b) the relocation of the government machinery from Dar es Salaam to
regional administrative centers-over 40% of the establishment had recently
been transferred; (c) the development of Ujamaa villages;l! and (d) the
promotion of alternative urban growth centers--Arusha, Moshi, Tanga,
Dodoma, Tabora, Mwanza, Mtwara, Nbeya and Morogoro had been so designated.
1.04       As of 1972, it also adopted the sites and services and squatter
upgrading approach to housing. A spec-'al parastatal of the Treasury, the
Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) had been established in the same year to
support the Government's new housing initiatives. The THB was to mobilize
savings and external resources for housing development and to promote
housing development by making technical and financial assistance available
for  sites  and  services  and  squatter  upgrading  projects,  housing
cooperatives, Ujamaa villages, and other owner-occupied housing schemes
under the proposed program.
I/ Societal units consisting of groups of families who farm the land
collectively and share in the proceeds according to the amount of work
contributed.



1.05      The second five-year plan (1970-1975) called for 5,000 serviced
plots to be provided, but in 1972 only 600 plots had been provided.  The
initial idea of low standards had become modified during implementation and
the focus had shifted from the original idea of services only to the
development of completed housing units.  Following a mid-plan review, the
officials in Tanzania felt that a good demonstration project was needed to
establish the approach and standards for the program. Tanzania lacked the
funds for their program and therefore approached IDA for assistance in
October 1972.
B. The Project
1.06      The project was to be implemented over a three-year period, and
was to be the first phase in the Government's nationwide low-cost housing
program.  As appraised, it consisted of:
(a) Provision of about 10,600 serviced sites for low income housing
located as follows:   (i) nearly 7,450 plots in three sites in
Dar es Salaam, (ii) about 2,300 plots in Mwanza, and (iii) about
850 plots in Mbeya.  Criteria used for the selection of project
sites included the availability of a reasonably large parcel of
land in conformity with the master plan; a good location in
relation to job opportunities, transportation and off-site
infrastructure; and, good natural drainage. Due to the magnitude
of the problem there, about 70% of the plots were to be in Dar es
Salaam.  The typical plot size was to be 288m2, which although
large compared to previous Bank/IDA projects, was appropriate in
the Tanzania context where multi-family occupancy and gardening
are standard.
(b) Upgrading of existing squatter settlements accommodating nearly
9,000 families in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya.  Simple layouts were
emphasized for economic construction and servicing and minimizing
compensation payments. The size of the project and the number of
regional centers included were determined by the estimated
capacity of Ardhi, THB and the regional administrative offices;
(c) Provision of eleven community education centers, one health
center, and eleven markets;
(d) Financing for low income housing loans through the THB;
(e) Consultant services for the design and detailed engineering of
basic infrastructure and community facilities, preparation of a
follow-up project and overall project supervision;
(f) A training program for technical staff of the Ministry of Lands,
Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi), to be carried out by
consultants;
(g) Expansion of the physical facilities of Ardhi Institute for its
town planning program;



- 3 -
(h) A pilot nutrition project to improve the nutritional awareness of
households in sites and services areas; and
(i) Equipment and vehicles.
1.07          Total costs were estimated to be approximately TSh.119.6m
(USS16.7m equivalent). The IDA Credit of US$8.5 million was to finance the
foreign exchange costs and 28% of local costs. The principal objectives of
the project were to (i) introduce and demonstrate an approach to housing
and servicing the urban poor; (ii) build up the institutional capacity for
implementing similar projects throughout the country; (iii) open up access
to credit for low income families to build low cost housing; and, (iv)
increase the housing stock and service infrastructure for the low income
population in project cities.
1.08        The project was set up for an implementation period of three
years.   The special unit,  initially known as the Sites  and  Services
Directorate, which had been established in Ardhi for preparation of the
project, was also to be responsible for its implementation. It was headed
by expatriate advisors who were funded by United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Other
staff members were to be transferred from the Office of the Commissioner
for Housing and consultants were to be used to fill the remaining gaps,
which were then mainly in the areas of engineering and design.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Identification
2.01      The project idea arose from the visit of an economic mission to
Tanzania in September 1971.  The mission's report highlighted Tanzania's
increasing requirements for infrastructure and housing. This was followed
by a reconnaissance mission in February 1972 which found Government
policies  regarding   low-cost   urban  housing   to  be   suitable   for
Baak-financing.   The Government's official request for assistance which,
was sent to the Bank in October 1972, was therefore favorably considered
and the formal process of project definition got underway.
B. Preparation
2.02       Preparation was carried out by the newly established Sites and
Services Directorate in Ardhi with the help of an engineering consulting
firm.   In the period between the first mission in February 1972 and
appraisal in August 1973 there were only two preparation missions.
2.03         Before the visit of the appraisal mission the consultants
prepared preliminary engineering designs and cost estimates for the
physical components.   Preparation of the rest of the project, including
TEB's lending program, institutional and financial aspects, as well as
technical assistance was far less advanced.  These components were being
handled by two expatriates funded by UNDP and CIDA, in the Sites and
Services Directorate of Ardhi. Most of the work on these components was
done during the appraisal mission with the assistance of the Bank staff.
C. Appraisal
2.04       Prior to the Appraisal mission's departure, concern centered on
four issues: (a) the political acceptability of the site and service and
upgrading concepts, (b) the unsuitability of the existing building code and
need to revise it, (c) the buildup of Ardhi's staff to manage the project,
and (d) the ground rent structure for recovering project costs.   These
issues were discussed in the Bank prior to the mission's departure and
departmental positions agreed. With the benefit of hindsight these still
appear to have been the right issues. In addition we should probably have
directed greater energies to reviewing the institutional framework for
managing the project and to the probable availability of building
materials. It should be noted that since this was one of the Bank's first
urban projects, considerable effort was devoted to working out the basic
physical details and design-matters which are now fairly standard,
particularly in second and third generation projects.
2.05       Appraisal took place from August 9 to September 10, 1973.  The
mission consisted of three Bank staff and one consultant who collectively
spent 16 staff weeks on the task.  The appraisal concentrated on working
out a suitable physical composition of the project and obtaining government
agreement on the preceding four issues. The original proposal which called
for the development of 19,000 new plots and infrastructural improvements to



- 5 -
5,000 existing squatter plots over a four year period was also scaled down
to what was thought to be a more manageable size as the Bank felt that the
proposed target was too high from the point of view of demand and implemen-
tation capacity.
2.06       Three of the four pre-appraisal issues subsequently became the
subject of covenants in the legal documents. These concerned house stan-
dards, project unit staffing and cost recovery.   The fourth (political
acceptability of the serviced site approach) was resolved by the Govern-
ment's willingness to proceed with processing of the project.
2.07          Negotiations were completed in April 1974 without any major
changes to the project.
D. Conclusions
2.08       Since there was no prior experience with this type of project in
Tanzania anti it was also a new area of lending for the Bank, preparation
was based on the state of the art at the time and on the best estimate of
Government implementation capabilities. The preparation process therefore
did not adequately address all aspects of the project.   The principal
shortcomings were (i) the insufficient attention paid to the preparation of
institutional and management aspects of the project; and (ii) the failure
to recognize the need for technical and advisory assistance to plot benefi-
ciaries.    The  serious  deterioration  in  Tanzania's  overall  economy,
following the global recession in 1974 was also not anticipated but would
have been hard to predict.   This led to widespread  shortages,  price
escalations and increased uncertainty which made the environment a very
difficult one to work in. The measures taken to address these constraints
were therefore less adequate than originally anticipated. The shortage of
staff in Ardhi also proved to be more difficult to redress than anticipated
at appraisal and this compounded the problems outlined above.
2.09       Although the Government agreed to the initially modest physical
standards, changes in staff and the institutional framework resulted in
difficulties in maintaining these standards. Further steps might have been
taken to amend the building regulations during preparation, or the
amendments might have been made part and parcel of the implementation
process.  This, however, would have been quite time-consuming and would
have delayed appraisal by at least a year.
2.10       In general, the preparation process might have been a more deli-
berative one, given the newness of the concepts and weaknesses in the
institutional structure.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01       The consultants for preliminary design for the infrastructural
element of the project were appointed from February 1973 and prequalifica-
tion of contractors started in May. As part of the preparatory work a pro-
curement workshop, sponsored by CIDA, but with participation by the Bank,
was held in August and September 1973. By the time of loan approval there-
fore the unit established in Ardhi was ready to engage contractors. There
were no special conditions set for effectiveness, which took place in
October 1974. Nevertheless, a two to three month delay occurred because of
difficulties in procurement, as is discussed in futher detail below.
(Section IIIE).
B. Progress of Physical Works
3.02      The physical components of the project can be divided into three
main categories:   infrastructure works; commiunity facilities; and, house
improvement and construction.   Progress with each category is outlined
below:
3.03        Infrastructure.   Infrastructure contracts covering roadworks,
drainage and the installation of the water distribution network had to be
scaled down to avoid cost overruns and because of unforeseen technical pro-
blems.  Changes made to avoid cost overruns were:  (i) the deferral of the
development of 881 plots in Mikocheni, Dar es Salaam and the reduction of
Nyakato in Mwanza by 498 plots; and, (ii) the lowering of the standards of
some project roads.  The scale of sites and services development was also
reduced by 350 plots, all of which were in Dar es Salaam,because of adverse
soil conditions; 103 other plots could not be developed due to the align-
ment of a water main in Dar es Salaam; and, 286 plots in Mbeya were
squatted upon before they could be developed. Altogether, 20% fewer plots
than planned were actually serviced.   These changes resulted in 3 to 6
months delay in contract completions as the quantities in some contracts
had to be reduced, and some others had to be retendered.
3.04      Work in upgraded areas proved to be more difficult than anticipa-
ted and this resulted in approximately six months delay (Chart 1).
3.05        The electrification contract was to have been implemented by
Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), a parastatal body.
Work was delayed initially by insufficient progress with other infrastruc-
ture work which had to be done first; and later, by closure of the border
with Kenya, in 1977, which increased the difficulty of procuring poles.
Finally, TANESCO diverted light fixtures ordered for this project when
there was felt to be a greater need elsewhere since occupancy levels in the
sites and services areas was still low.  When Ardhi finally insisted that
TANESCO reorder and install the fixtures, a dispute over responsibility for

covering the cost overruns due to the delays led to a suspension of the
work in December 1980.   Only the lighting for the community facilities
portion of the contract has been completed. The dispute has been referred
for arbitration.
3.06       Community Facilities.  Whereas 30 community facility structures
were to have been provided under the project, only 25 were built, as the
scope of the project had to be reduced to avoid cost overruns. Consider-
able delays were encountered with construction of the community facilities
due to institutional factors; incomplete formulation of the design concept
for the educational facilities; and, difficulties in procuring building
materials.   Once built, however, the facilities particularly in squatter
areas have been very well utilized.   The main institutional problem was
that of split responsibilities and a consequent lack of accountability.
The sectoral ministries were responsible for the eventual staffing and
operations and therefore had to approve the designs, whereas the Ministry
of Works had statutory responsibility for their construction.   Ardhi, as
host Ministry was responsible for coordination, but it had no real powers
for fulfilling its responsibilities. Work on the design of the community
facilities was also neglected during the early implementation period as
Ardhi had been unable to hire the full staff complement needed for the
project.   Initial efforts of the staff it did have were focussed on the
infrastructure works. By the time the design work got underway, economic
conditions had deteriorated and there were acute shortages of essential
materials and a great deal of uncertainty which delayed the finalization of
the designs as well as construction. The Community Education Centers were
to incorporate new concepts then being developed by the Ministry of
Education and this also contributed to the delays in the finalization of
the design.
3.07      The procurement of building materials became extremely difficult
as the economy deteriorated following the world price increases in 1973/74
the collapse of the East African Community in 1977 and the 1977/78 war with
Uganda.   Building material industries operated well below their installed
production capacity and imports were inadequate to meet the shortfall. In
1977, for example, the total demand for cement in the country was estimated
to be 800,000 tons, whereas only 246,500 tons were produced locally and
another 200,000 tons were imported.  The supply was therefore adequate to
meet only 56% of the demand. Similarly in 1978, supply was estimated to be
only  36%  of  demand.2/    The  shortages  were  much  more acute in  the
up-country towns as a result of the system of pan-territorial pricing
whereby differential pricing according to location and transport costs was
not allowed.  Furthermore, even when materials were available, they were
often sold on the unofficial market at highly inflated prices.  Rapidly

increasing prices (Table 1) also delayed progress as costs had to be fre-
quently revised.
3.08      House Improvement and Construction.  At appraisal it was antici-
pated that some 10,600 new homes, would have been constructed in newly
developed sites and that the provision of services to 8,800 units in
squatter areas would stimulate home improvement by residents in these
areas. Due to mid-project changes and unanticipated growth, however, only
about 8,500 new sites were serviced while over 14,600 housing units were
provided with services in upgraded areas.  There was a protracted lag in
consolidation of newly serviced sites (Table 2) whereas the construction of
new inf ill units took place at an average annual rate of over 6% in up-
graded areas.   As expected,  the residents of the upgraded areas have
improved and expanded their homes.
3.09       The most critical factor retarding house construction, however,
appears to have been the shortage of building materials referred to above.
As house construction in sites and services areas had to await completion
of infrastructure work, its timing coincided with the period of increased
difficulties. In the latter part of 1981, following the opening of a new
cement factory in Tanga, the rate of construction in Dar es Salaam
increased dramatically, as the supply of cement improved. Construction in
the upcountry towns continues to take place very slowly (Table 2).  Some
improvement can, however, be expected shortly, following the withdrawal of
pan-territorial pricing as of June 1982.  The delay of house construction
in sites and services areas however is also attributable to the inadequate
attention given to the house loan program and housing delivery system and
the failure to include advisory and technical assistance services to
project beneficiaries during preparation and appraisal. The second project
includes a cadre of community development workers for this task.

C. Progress of Non-Physical Program
3.10      Construction Loan Program.  The project design provided for con-
struction loans for 7,400 households on new plots and 4,400 households in
squatter areas.3/  As of December 1981, THB had met 18Z and 34% of its
target, in terms of number of loans approved in site and services and up-
grading areas respectively. THB's inability to meet its target can be
attributed to a number of factors, notably:  (i) Ardhi was on its critical
path in both site and service and upgraded areas; (ii) Urban Councils were
reluctant to approve construction in materials other than sand-cement;4/
(iii) THB had problems in the staffing of its sites and services loan
section, its internal procedures were complex, and its requirements strin-
gent; and, (iv) there were building material shortages.
3.11       In sites and services areas, THB could only approve loans after
infrastructure works had been completed and plots allocated.   Although
initially it also disbursed loan funds prior to title issuance, the prac-
tice was discontinued in 1980 and a title deed is now required for dis-
bursement. Ardhi's lands department takes up to three years to issue indi-
vidual titles, hence the delay is a protracted one. Although the title re-
quirement is not an unreasonable one, the cumbersome land registration and
title issuance system in Tanzania makes it unworkable. In upgrading areas
rural lending procedures, which are less stringent, are applied.  THB is
able to approve and disburse against loans in upgraded areas once house re-
gistration has taken place as it uses its rural loan procedures in these
areas.
3.12      THB, jointly with Ardhi's Building Research Unit, produced stand-
ard plans for houses constructed of soil cement and mud and poles. The use
of THB financing to construct such houses, however, has not occurred to
date. Possible reasons for this lack of popularity include the reluctance
of the recreated Urban Councils to approve of such construction 5/ and,
possibly, THB's own qualified acceptance of these alternatives.
3/ Funds were provided for only about 60% of these units in the project.
THB's house loans were erroneously stated as being TSh.45,000,000 in
the  Staff Appraisal  Report.    According  to  the Development  Credit
Agreement US$ equivalent 2,000,000 was provided for THB loans.   The
Association was to finance 50% of the amount disbursed, hence the TSh
amount that was to have been disbursed by the THB should have been
TSh.28,560,000 (US$4,000,000 equivalent). THB spent all of the funds
provided for it under the project and fully utilized its share of the
credit.
4/ 5/  In its comment on the draft PCR (Annex) the Dar es Salaam City
Council (DCC) states that 'Urban Councils were unable to approve
construction in material other than sand-cement because the letter
of plot offer, a legal instrument of the Government of Tanzania,
stipulates that the construction should be with permanent building
materials...".   During negotiations, however,  the Government had
agreed to waive these requirements (see Section 3.06 (ii) of the
Development Credit Agreement dated July 12, 1984).



- 12 -
3.13        Changes in senior level staff within the sites and services
section of the THB also reduced their ability to develop a strong program.
As personnel changes occurred, the new staff had to develop their own
understanding of the program before they could build upon the achievements
of their successors.   The post of unlt manager, for example, which is a
very critical one was occupied by four different persons between 1980 and
1982.
3.14       Alt'hough the financial loan program was changed to a material
loan one in 19;, the new program has not been well-established because of
the building mat:erial shortages (Section III B) and the consequent extreme
difficulty  in  controlling  inventory.    The up-country  towns were more
adversely affee.ted as THB constructed only one go down, which was located
in Dar es Salaam. Therefore, when materials were available THB was unable
to take more than they could dispose of immediately in the up-country
towns.
3.15      On average, between 1976 and 1981, THB approved approximately 260
loans per year in sites and services areas and 300 per year In upgrading
areas.   There has not, however,  been a pattern of steady growth.   The
number of loans approved increased from 170 in 1976 to 506 in 1977 and 529
in 1978 but fell to 174 in 1979 and rose to only 237 In 1980. In order to
develop a strong program THB would have to come up with a workable alterna-
tive to a title as collateral or improve the title issuance system.  It
would also have to continue to promote less costly alternative materials,
improve its management and reconsider Its procedures and requirements.
Support for these types of changes under a third project is being consi-
dered. Although THB's achievements have fallen short of its targets, the
importance of its initiatlon of the granting of constructlon loans to the
urban poor should not be discounted.
3.16        Pilot Nutrition Program.  The pilot nutrition program was to
motivate and assist low income urban households to Improve their nutrltion
through producing nutritious food at home. It was spearheaded by a Danish
volunteer horticulturalist. Two nutrition and garden centers and ten small
demonstration gardens were established in Manzese and Tandale in Dar es
Salaam.   In order to encourage fruit tree and vegetable cultivation and
poultry keeping, extension services, nutrition education and cooking
classes were established.   Essential inputs, such as seedlings, insecti-
cides and to.ls were sold In the centers established. The program was very
popular and the centers continue to operate on a self-supporting basis.
3.17       Training.   The training component was intended to address the
shortage of technical personnel .dentified during the preparation through
the training of 12 civil/sanitary technical assistants. The program was to
have been implemented in three phases:   (i) inventory and evaluation of
local manpower and other resources, and the preparation of a training pro-
gram; (ii) implementation of the program; and (iII) evaluation of the pro-
gram and institution of any required changes. The project was also to con-
tribute to the general development of manpower within the sector through
the construction of training facilities for planners at Ardhi Institute.



- 13 -
3.18      The program was implemented as planned, and two sets of technical
school graduates were trained.  As provided for at appraisal, six worked
with the consulting engineers on the preparation of the second project;
three others worked as engineering assistants on project implementation;
and one worked with the project unit in Ardhi. Another went on to further
studies and the other left the sector altogether.
3.19      Whereas at appraisal it was anticipated that the embrionic train-
ing unit would eventually have been transferred to Ardhi Institute, which
was just starting to provide training in Physical Planning and Housing,
this did not take place. The trainees also eventually became dissatisfied
and restless as the program did not qualify them for promotion along a de-
fined career path. They are therefore unlikely to remain with the program.
Hence, although the short-term benefits were achieved the long-term bene-
fits are not likely to be realized. This limited success is largely attri-
butable to the short time horizon used during preparation--the project pre-
paration team, while focusing on the more immediate tasks failed to examine
the scheme of service in the public sector.  They therefore did not get
what appears to have been a technically sound program officially recognized
by the responsible authorities.
3.20       Ardhi Institute's training facilities were completed with only
minor delays. The program benefited from its operation as several of the
graduates have since joined the unit or filled complementary positions at
the local level.
3.21      Monitoring and Evaluation.  A system for monitoring and evalua-
tion (M&E) of the project was developed by a consultant appointed for that
purpose in 1975. Some useful work was done but the results were not fully
utilized and the component was finally dropped because of limited counter-
part funding and unclear responsibilities.   This was largely due to an
underlying conflict between the management and evaluation staff. Although
the consultant depended on the support of the project unit staff, he
reported directly to the principal secretary rather than the project
manager. This created an atmosphere of mistrust and conflict. Under the
second project, M&E has been made a part of the management information
system, with the person responsible for its implementation reporting to the
project manager.
D. Project Costs
3.22      Throughout implementation, costs were carefully monitored and the
scope of works and construction standards were adjusted to retain priority
items while keeping within the budget. The value of the shilling, how-
ever, fluctuated. As of October 1975, it was tied to the Standard Drawing
Rights (SDR) of the IMF and was therefore subject to the changing exchange
rates in relation to the US dollar and other currencies. The shilling was
also devalued by 13X in October 1975 and by 10% in February 1979.  These
adjustments and exchange rate changes resulted in the project being
completed with a 6% overrun in terms of the US dollar equivalent amount
(Table 3).

- 15 -
3.23      The overrun on equipment and vehicles is due to their having been
purchased during the latter part of the extended implementation period when
prices were significantly higher than those anticipated at appraisal. Cost
overruns on consultancy services are attributable to the over assessment of
local capabilities during preparation and the consequent need to utilize
more consultants than originally anticipated. These overruns were offset
by reductions in the costs of the civil works component which was cut
through the reduction in the size of some sites and the downgrading of some
project roads.
E. Procurement
3.24       Civil works on each site were divided into several small con-
tracts with local contractors being allowed a 7 1/2Z preferences in order
to stimulate participation.   The contracts were tendered in groups to
allow for the participation of large as well as small contractors.  Con-
tractors found it difficult to operate in the Tanzanian environment which
was characterized by periodic material scarcities; delays in the import of
equipment and spare parts; rapid inflation; unavailability of finance and a
high level of taxation.   Those few that bid therefore internalized these
risks in their prices.
3.25      An order to assist and encourage more contractors to bid, prequa-
lification requirements were reduced. The contract documents were also
modified to allow for mobilization advances to compensate for the contrac-
tors' lack of finance. However, the project unit still found it difficult
to obtain realistic bids and had to modify the scope of works. Where sub-
stantial changes had to be made on project sites to avoid cost overruns,
rebidding was necessary; less substantial reductions in the scope of work
were negotiated with the lowest bidder on each such contract.
F. Disbursements
3.26      Chart 2 compares the actual disbursement schedule with that anti-
cipated at appraisal. Delays in disbursement reflected delays in implemen-
tation and in submissions of requests for reimbursement. The project, how-
ever, compares favorably with other projects in the sector and with other
projects in Tanzania as indicated in Table 4.

G. Unit Costs
3.27       Unit costs in Tanzania shillings for serviced plots were about
15% over those anticipated at appraisal and for upgraded areas, about 15%
below  those  estimated  as  shown  in  Table  5.   Because  of  subsequent
devaluations in the Tanzania shillings however, the actual dollar
equivalent in unit costs was below that estimated at appraisal in both
cases: 9% below for serviced sites and 34% below for upgrading.
H. Conclusions
3.28       The project as implemented differed from that appraised in that:
ti) there were 20% fewer sites and services plots; (ii) there was a 66% in-
crease in the number of households provided with services in the upgraded
areas; (iii) 12% instead of 83% of plot beneficiaries received house con-
struction or improvement loans; (iv) 25 instead of 30 community facilities
were constructed; and (v) cost recovery mechanisms were significantly
altered (see Chapter IV, Section D).  The project unit had also been up-
graded to divisional status and urban councils had been recreated (see
Chapter VI).
3.29         Implementation also took longer than anticipated, and can be
divided into two distinct phases:   first, an early phase during which
things went well; and secondly, a later phase during which intractable pro-
blems were encountered.  The difference between the two phases is mainly
due to the changes in the institutional and economic environment which
could not have been foreseen at appraisal.   Some of the early successes,
however, were at least in part at the expense of later phases of the proj-
ect as work on a number of issues and tasks had been delayed because
Ardhi's capacity was inadequate to deal with them promptly. When they were
eventually given the attention needed the environment was a much more
difficult one to work in and the delays were therefore compounded.
3.30       The Closing Date of the project was extended by two years from
12/31/78 to 12/31/80 in June 1978. This was to allow for the completion of
community facilities and to enable the THB to improve its lending program
and the draw-down of project funds, utilizing the innovations and incen-
tives introduced under the second project.
3.31         These modifications did not compromise the principal project
objectives of introducing and demonstrating an approach to housing and pro-
viding services for the urban poor.  The 20X reduction in the number of
site and services plots was offset by a 66% increase in the number of
households provided with services in the upgraded areas.   These changes
resulted in a net increase of almost 20% in the number of residential units
served. The population served in the upgraded areas is poorer than that in
the sites   and services areas and therefore the poverty impact of the
project was greater than anticipated at appraisal. Although a functional
shelter delivery system was not developed, a small cadre of professionals
capable of extending the program was established.



-19-
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Role and Performance of Consultants
4.01      Consultants were involved in virtually all aspects of the project
from the policy stage through design and supervision of contract
implementation.   Furthermore, because the capacity of the available staff
was initially overestimated the project unit found that it had to hire
consultants   to  perform  more  implementation   tasks   than  initially
aniticipated. As the local staff gained experience they questioned the use
of consultants and there was generally a great deal of discussion before a
consensus could be reached regarding the limits of the local capacity and
the need for outside assistance.   Some officials also expressed a strong
preference for consultants from lower-cost countries because of the more
modest cost involved.   In addition to the budgetary considerations, they
felt that the discrepancies between consultants' salaries and those of
their co-workers might have a demoralizing effect on the local staff.
4.02           The consultants generally worked diligently and produced
satisfactory work. A retrospective evaluation of the design work, however,
suggests that some of the road reserves were too wide and that the road and
drainage standards might have been more closely related to maintenance
capabilities. The flaws in the work of the consultants can be attributed
to oversights during preparation and appraisal.   Had the administrative
arrangements for the M&E consultant been more appropriate, for example, the
outcome of his work would have been more useful. Similarly, the input of
the training consultant would have achieved the long-term benefits
anticipated if accreditation had been arranged and the career paths of the
trainees been worked out with the appropriate Ministry. The lack of prior
experience in the sector at the time made it very difficult to avoid such
oversights.
4.03      The mistakes, however, did not provide the only lessons.  Through
working with the consultants, the local staff developed practical skills to
complement the academic training that they joined the unit with. The con-
sultants also established useful procedures which the local staff are now
using for implementing similar projects.   The demonstration phase being
over, existing capacity is having to be addressed more directly and this
has changed the nature of the role to be played by consultants.  Consul-
tants are now being used to complement rather than expand capacity; they
are also being used to initiate the implementation of new techniques rather
than to introduce new concepts.
B. Performance of Contractors
4.04       Contractors generally did a good job and completed the infra-
structure works in sites and services areas with only minor time overruns.
Upgrading contracts took longer to be completed because working in already
settled areas proved to be more difficult than originally envisaged. The
delays in completion of the community facilities contract, which were
supervised by the Ministry of Works were exacerbated by the institutional
problems described in Section IIIB and the building material shortages.
More careful prequalifiation of these contractors, however, would have
helped avoid some of these problems.



-20-
4.05      In general, wherever possible the borrower preferred to use other
government agencies or parastatals as contractors.   Where these public
sector agencies had to compete with private firms for jobs, their contrac-
tual obligations were clearly spelled out from the start and their perfor-
mance was satisfactory. Where they had sole responsibility for work within
the sector, as was the case with TANESCO, contractual obligations tended to
be less clearly defined and full payment was required in advance.  This
resulted in considerable difficulties being encountered in the resolution
of conflicts.
4.06      Similarly, the project unit found it difficult to establish arms-
length contractual relationships and manage consultancy contracts with
Ardhi Institute, which falls wlthin the same Ministerial portfolio.
4.07      If the public sector is going to continue to play an active role
in implementation, the rules and procedures for establishing contractual
obligations between government agencies will need to be more precisely
defined. Procedures for the timely resolution of conflicts should be more
clearly defined also, and lOOX advance payments should be avoided.
C. Performance of Standards Used
4.08       Infrastructure.  The modest infrastructure standards used were
based on the assumptions that a reasonable level of maintenance would take
place and on specific types and volumes of traffic expected.   However,
almost no maintenance whatsoever took place following the maintenance
period of the contractors and this presented a serious threat to the
investment, especially the roads. Furthermore, traffic volumes on project
roads were higher than originally anticipated and this has accelerated the
deterioration of the roads.
4.09       Steps are now being taken, under the second project, to tackle
the  problem  of  maintenance.    In  Dar  es  Salaam, where  the  bulk  of
investments took place, road maintenance equipment is being purchased for
the newly-created City Council. Training for the city's maintenance staff
is  also  being  provided,  with  the  assistance  of  Kreditanstalt  fUr
Wiederaufbau (XfW).
4.10       In 1979, the Bank hired the firm of consultants which had done
the initial designs, but who were no longer involved with the project, to
review and evaluate the standards used and their implications for mainte-
nance. Their report highlighted the trade-offs between the level of stan-
dards and the amount of maintenance required. They recommended that: ti)
in the future either much higher road standards, requiring less maintenance
should be used.   Or, if the capital is not available for that, initial
standards should be even lower; (ii) where more modest road standards are
to be used the standard of the complementary drainage system should be
upgraded to protect the investment; (iii) site selection criteria should be
more stringent in respect of characteristics facilitating natural drainage
and; (iv) that, more erosion-resistant materials should be used for the
road-base.   They concluded that the standards used for  the water and
electrical systems were well suited to the incremental approach.



- 21 -
4.11      Community Facilities:  The design of the community facilities was
based on the patterns of service delivery and standards in use at the time
of appraisal. The national standards have since been revised downwards as
a result of fiscal stringency.
4.12       House Construction.  The issue of standards for house construc-
tion was a source of controversy from preparation and throughout negotia-
tions and implementation.   The standards at the time of appraisal were
bared on the colonial experience and were judged by the Bank's appraisal
team to be unaffordable to the majority of Tanzanians. The Bank felt that
affordability to the low-income majority should be taken into account and
that this could be done by starting with modest standards. These could be
gradually improved as individual household budgets allowed families to
improve their houses and to pay for higher standards of services; and, as
increased revenues allowed the government to upgrade the infrastructure.
The government agreed to revise its standards, but since the drafting of
new legislation would take time, the existing regulations would be waived
for project implementation.
4.13            Initial  doubts  about  the  acceptability  of  the  initial
infrastructure standards have proven to be unfounded as the sites and
services plots were very popular and attracted applicants from a wide
cross-section of society.   Some plots in the sites and services areas
eventually went to more affluent households than those within the target
group (see Section VI). This has resulted in the construction of houses of
a higher standard and earlier applications for individual water connections
than originally envisaged.   Households have tended to install soak-away
sanitation systems but, although they function satisfactorily, the small
lot-size precludes that the system may be used satisfactorily for all lots
in the area.  Had it been envisaged that high income dwellings were to be
constructed, the construction of a conventional sewerage system at an
earlier stage might have been a more cost-effective alternative.
4.14      Under the second project, the THB, in cooperation with the Build-
ing Research Unit (BRU), a parastatal of Ardhi, produced type plans for
building in traditional materials as well as sand-cement.   Model houses
were also constructed in project sites.   However, TEB has financed no
soil-cement or mud and pole units whatsoever.  It appears that some town
and housing bank officials did not fully understand the project concept and
have discouraged rather than encouraged the initially low standards.
Furthermore, the letters of offer sent to plot recipients require
construction in  permanent' materials.   Although Ardhi is not enforcing
this clause, some town officials appear to be doing so.  It might also be
discouraging some plot recipients from investing in "non-perr-anent'
materials on their plots.
4.15       In keeping with the progressive development model, a number of
participants have built small houses at the back of their plots from tradi-
tional materials using their own funds.   Many have subsequently built a
'front" house more gradually from permanent materials.   Similarly, many
project participants, notably those in upgraded areas, have rendered their
mud and pole houses with cement, thus greatly improving the units' durabi-
lity and value. Most, however, have chosen to build in sand-cement.



-22-
D. Compliance with Covenants
4.16       The covenants were to ensure the timely institution of measures
which were considered to be critical for project implementation and the
achievement of its ultimate goals. Some covenants proved to be more diffi-
cult to comply with than originally envisaged because of:   The chronic
shortage of skilled manpower in Tanzania; the Government's reluctance to
hire outside experts; cumbersome bureaucratic procedures; and, the lack of
local counterpart funds.  Others needed significant resource inputs which
might more appropriately have been tied to complementary project
components.
4.17       Building Standards.  Ardhi has prepared a revised draft of the
building regulations in accordance with the covenant.   The bureaucratic
procedures necessary to have the draft regulations officially accepted are,
however, apparently cumbersome and the officials concerned are reluctant to
tackle the problem.  The reestablishment of urban authorities complicates
the matter by passing responsibility to individual town councils. However,
acceptance of modest semi-permanent building materials and standards has
assumed increasing importance for success of the national sites and
services and upgrading program. It has been endorsed in the housing policy
paper and recently accepted by Cabinet as the only practical way to house
the majority of Tanzanians under present circumstances.
4.18      Staffing.  Ardhi was unable to comply with the covenant requiring
them to fill existing vacancies, as their recruitment efforts met with
little success and they were unwilling to hire expatriates for these posts.
Some government officials have also found it difficult to reconcile the
staffing establishment required to implement this, and other Bank projects,
because of the contrast with the smaller establishment for internally-
financed projects of a comparable or larger size.   Compliance with the
audit covenants was also delayed by staff shortages as the project was
unable to keep its accounts up-to-date. The project unit now has adequate
financial staff in place and performance in this area is much improved.
Subsequent projects have been supporting changes to the system which enable
implementation to take place with fewer professional personnel.  Training
is also being given greater emphasis. IDA and the Government are also dis-
cussing ways in which the shortage of financial and auditing skills can be
addressed within a comprehensive framework across all sectors.
4.19      Cost Recovery Covenants.  Attempts to implement the cost recovery
covenants met with little initial success, as: (i) No mechanism for direct
cost recovery existed at the time of project preparation and the appraisal
team therefore developed a formula to introduce such a charge in project
areas; and, (ii) the legislative framework changed soon after the credit
became effective. The new Act, the Land Rent and Service Charge (LRSC) Act
introduced a new land tax. The level of charges derived from the project
formula was much higher than in comparably serviced adjacent areas assessed
under the new act. This resulted in inequity and political controversy, as
allatteek refused to pay the fees required to obtain title to their plots.



-23-
4.20        The Government therefore requested an amendment of the Credit
Agreement in order to bring charges for project areas within the purview of
the new LRSC Act. The proposed amendment was approved by IDA in February
1977. Further difficulties were encountered because the wording of the new
Act inadvertently did not provide for charges to be levied in squatter
areas. Because of the political sensitivity of this issue, a Cabinet deci-
sion was ultimately required to reintroduce the charge in squatter areas.
The administrative framework to effect collection also proved to be inade-
quate for widespread implementation.   These problems are being addressed
under the second project.
4.21       In general, compliance with covenants was unsatisfactory during
much of the implementation period for the reasons indicated above. Signi-
ficant improvement occurred when preparation of the third project was halt-
ed pending improvements in compliance. Good progress is now being made.
E. Financial Performance and Project Replicability
4.22      Pricing.  Individuals were expected to make monthly payments for
ground rent, repayment of construction loans, and utility bills, if any.
The ground rent was to consist of the statutory ground rent and the service
charge.  The statutory rent was to be a charge levied by the Treasury for
the privilege of using land, calculated at 4% of its capital value whereas
the service charge was to be based on the cost of the infrastructure pro-
vided.
4.23         Cost Recovery Performance.   Plot occupants employed by the
Government, parastatals and businesses with ten or more employees were ex-
pected to make monthly payment through a salary deduction system. Benefi-
ciaries without a salary deduction option were expected to pay through
Ardhi's regional offices.
4.24       In order to implement the provisions of the new legislation the
economic value of the land had to be determined, houses had to be regis-
tered and demand notices sent out before actual collections could take
place.  There was therefore an extended period when very little progress
was made during which the Association repeatedly expressed its concern. In
October 1976, during negotiations for the second project, the Government
agreed to launch a nationwide program of house registration, starting in
Manzese, and to review the provision of the LRSC Act with a view to expe-
diting the start-up of collections.   The study was completed in August
1977.
4.25       By April 1978, however, only six of the 42 blocks in Manzese had
been registered.  Collectioas of land revenues nationwide continued to be
poor as demand notices were being sent through the mail to plot-recipients
at their post office boxes and it was virtually impossible to personally
contact defaultors.  Furthermore, the Treasury, which was responsible for
collections had very little incentive to collect these charges, as they re-
presented a very small percentage of their total revenues.



- 24 -
4.26       In June 1980 a paper recommending an interim charge of TSh.100
was approved by the Economic Committee of Cabinet to facilitate the
initiation of collections pending the development of an appropriate system
for  plot valuation.   Simultaneously,  the Association and the agencies
involved in the implementation of the project undertook a review of the
experience with the Treasury, financed from the proceeds of the second
project. By December 1980 the registration of Manzese had been completed
by Ardhi and handed over to the new collections unit.
4.27      Cost recovery was finally initiated in Manzese in March 1981 when
preliminary demand notices were issued to the residents. By April 1982, 80Z
of the expected amount had been collected.
4.28       Ardhi has subsequently registered all the sites upgraded under
the first project and the unit in the Treasury is proceeding with collec-
tions.6/   Proposals for the third project include provisions for house
registrations covering the total built-up areas of project towns.   The
Government has raised the interim charge from TSh.100 to TSh.125 and is
currently looking at ways of devising a simple valuation system which is
capable of being implemented with its existing manpower. The findings and
recommendations of the study financed from the proceeds of the second
project are being used in this process.
4.29         The redelegation of responsibility for collections to urban
authorities as of June 1982 is an encouraging move in a direction supported
by IDA.   The incentive to collect these charges at the local level is
likely to be much greater than that at the central level as the amount in-
volved represents a significant portion of the local budget but only an in-
significant share of general revenues.
4.30      Proceeds of the credit made available to THB by the Treasury at
3% interest for 25 years were to be onlent to beneficiaries at 6Z. Funds
accruing to the THB as a result of the difference between its borrowing and
relending rates were to be used for future loans, after covering adminis-
trative costs and any defaults in repayment.   In 1979, however, as indi-
cated below, as part of an overall revision of its interest rate structure,
the rate chargeable on these low income urban housing loans was reduced to
4% thus reducing the spread and therefore the potential for the creation of
a revolving fund. No information is available on THB's collections, how-
ever, due to equipment failures.   The data available, however, suggests
that the te~,_ent record is satisfactory.
4.?l      This was a new area of operations for the Association and for THB
and only a limited analysis of the financial status of the Housing Bank,
the main financial intermediary was done. The following observations can
be made on the basis of THB's audited financial statements for the years
1976 to 1979 and the unaudited accounts for 1980; (i) Although the bank has
grown rapidly since its inception its continued viability is threatened by
a decline in its debt equity ratio from 1.53 at the end of 1976 to an

Treasury's collection efforts are directed at only approximately 57Z of
the plots due to the incomplete nature of the data passed on to them.

Unit of DCC is addressing the ommissions in the registers.

unsatisfactory 5.26 at the end of 1980; (ii) Disbursement of loans up to
88% of resources generated through equity, loan capital and deposits leaves
an inadequate margin of resources in liquid investments; and, (iii) It has
become over-dependent on a single source of funds-- the Workers and Farmers
Housing Development Fund which accounted for 91% of its loan capital at the
end  of  1980.    Although  THB  has  initiated  lending  for  low  income
beneficiaries, it has not done so within a replicable framework and its
potential future role is therefore very limited.
F. Conclusions
4.32        The major conclusions on general operating performance are as
follows:
(a) It is debatable whether the extensive use of consultants has en-
hanced local capacity, or delayed its development. Obviously it
would be preferable to utilize consultants with proven training
capacities, but these are hard to find. There was some transfer
of skills and the consultants produced satisfactory work;
(b) More careful review of prequalification of community facilities
contractors might have avoided some consequent implementation
problems.  Civil works contractors were generally satisfactory.
Contracts with government agencies such as TANESCO proved least
satisfactory, because of their monopoly on a particular service
and the consequent loss of leverage over performance;
(c) Maintenance of infrastructure was a persistent problem, exacer-
bated by design flaws but essentially due to inadequate recurrent
budgets;
(d)  Compliance  with  legal  covenants  was  not  impressive but was
obstructed by country wide staffing shortages, lack of recurrent
budgets, Government's reluctance to hire external consultants,
and Tanzania's bureaucratic structure;
(e) Cost recovery proved a major and fundamental issue--perhaps the
primary issue of project implementation.   The mid-stream shift
from one vehicle (direct plot charges) to another (LRSC or pro-
perty tax) inevitably involved securing political approvals anew
--a long, drawn-out process requiring two years. Once approved,
the sheer mechanics of house registration, tax roll preparation,
and the hiring, training and equipping of staff took another year
or more.  Thus a three year lag occurred between completion of
services and  startup  of  cost  recovery.    The  suspension  of
processing on the third project underscored the importance of the
issue and probably helped expedite progress;
(f) Interesc rates on house loans have persistently been well below
"real  rates ranging from 4% to 5% in the face of inflation rates
of 15% to 36%. This violated no covenants but has obviously con-
tributed to the decapitalization of the Housing Bank.

V. PROJECT BENEFITS
A. Beneficiaries
5.01       The project has provided services for over 200,000 persons in
newly serviced and upgraded areas.  Eighty-five percent of these benefi-
ciaries are in upgraded areas where the majority of residents are within
the target group, which was defined as those earning between TSh.200
(US$28) and TSh.600 (US$84) per month.  According to a 1976/77 Bureau of
Statistics Survey only 15Z of the households in Manzese earned over TSh.400
(US$48) per month.
5.02        The quality and size of the units built in site and services
areas, however, suggest that many of the occupants earn far more than the
target group. Although the plots were originally allocated on the basis of
points which gave priority to lower-Income earners and the land tenure
system does not allow for private transfers of land between individuals, it
is believed that many of the plots have been unofficially transferred to
more affluent indivlduals.   Some plots also may have been allocated to
persons outside of the target group due to: (i) corruption, (ii) a lack of
awareness of the criteria established at appraisal on the part of the
officials, especially those in the newly recreated councils; (iti)
pressures from the other groups due to the general shortage of serviced
plots; and (iv) Tanzania's national policy and philosophy which explicitly
discourages the creation of separate residential areas for particular
groups.   Plot holders who qualified on the basis of their official low
Incomes may also have more substantial unofficial sources of lncomes.  In
other cases, dwelling units have been constructed using pooled resources
rather than the incomes of the single beneficiaries.
5.03      The 71B's records also provide a useful indicator of the incomes
of plot beneficiaries who have been able to build. As of June 1978, twelve
percent of plot recipients had obtained loans from the bank; fifteen per-
cent of these recipients earned less than TSh.466 per month; another 46%
earned between TSh.467 and TSh.l,O00 per month and 39Z earned over
TSh.l,000. Approximately 50Z of the TIB loan recipients therefore appear
to be within the target income range of TShs.750 per month.
5.04       The slow rate of house construction may also be largely due to
difficulties in mobilizing funds. The plots which have not yet been built
upon may therefore belong to lower Income earners than those whlch already
have buildings on them.
5.05       Receipt of some plots by higher-income earners, however, is not
altogether negative.  Although the poverty reL:essal goal of our urban
projects is not met when this occurs, it does provide a needed basic
service to a group which, in the Tanzanian context, have very modest In-
comes anyway. These plots were the only ones available during the project
implementation period and therefore had to cater for a wider cross-section
than originally anticipated.



- 27 -
5.06      Project investments in infrastructure and services were matched
by over TSh.300m (US$35m) in additional investment in house construction
which would not have taken place without the project.   Although project
beneficiaries did much of the construction work themselves (see photo-
graph), they also hired craftsmen to assist them, thus also providing
additional emplovment. As labor represents approximatly 20% of house con-
struction costs in Tanzania, the value of employment generated by the proj-
ect was about TSh.60Qm (US$7m).  About 80% of the houses built are also
Swahili" type houses which provide additional income for plot beneficia-
ries through the rental of rooms.
5.07        The high level of usage of community facilities and nutrition
centers suggests that the project has also generated the expected less-
tangible external benefits such as improved health, lower infant mortality
and a higher level of education.
B. Economic Reevaluation
5.08        The internal economic rate.of return was recalculated on the
basis of a comparison of the cost and rental value of newly constructed
units in sites and services areas; and, on the basis of changes in the
rental value in upgraded areas. At appraisal project sites showed a rate
of return ranging from 10.4% in Mikocheni tow.4.5% in Manzese. Reestimates
were done for Dar es Salaam sites only as 80% of the residential sites
serviced were in that city and enough plots had been built upon to justify
a reanalysis.  Reestimates (Table 6) assuming that all serviced sites are
fully developed by 1985 showed rates of return ranging from 20% in
Mikocheni to 33% in Manzese. Due to the delay in consolidation, estimates
were also done for the Dar es Salaam sites and services areas with incom-
plete development as of February 1982 (Table 2). Only minor changes in the
rate of return were noted in Sinza and Kijitonyama where over 60Z of the
plots were occupied.   In Mikocheni, however, where infrastructure costs
were higher and only 50% of the plots were occupied, the rate fell from 20%
to 16%.
5.09        The higher overall rate of return in site and services areas,
despite the delays, is attributable to the rise in rental values of the
units constructed being greater than anticipated at appraisal and well in
excess of the rise in costs.  In other words, housing is scarcer than it
used to be, and commands a distinct premium.   The higher rate in the
Manzese area is due to the increase in density which took place during
implementation.

C. Conclusions
5.10         The main differences between the expected beneficiaries at
appraisal and the actual beneficiaries has been the inclusion of higher in-
come earners in the serviced site areas, a decrease in the number of sites
and services beneficiaries and an increase in the number of beneficiaries
in the upgraded areas.   The rate of return in serviced site areas was
generally higher in the areas with more modest standards of services and
lower for Mikocheni, where standards and infrastructure costs were signifi-
cantly higher. The upgrading subproject showed the highest rate of return,
largely because of the modest standards and the early materialization of
the benefit stream.
5.11       In subsequent phases, the poverty-redresssal goal is being given
even greater emphasis.   Upgrading is being continued and newly serviced
areas are being provided with much lower levels of services as surveyed
plots are being provided instead of serviced sites.   In surveyed plot
areas, beneficiaries are being provided with demarcated sites in planned
layouts within which initial services are limited to graded access, storm
water drainage and shared standpipes.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01          One of the principal objectives  of  the  project was  the
strengthening of the Government's institutional capacity to plan and imple-
ment an ongoing national sites and services program. Officials in Tanzania
as well as at the Bank felt that a good demonstration project was needed to
establish the policy. The most immediate constraint affecting the achieve-
ment of this goal was seen as the shortage of qualified staff. This con-
straint was to be addressed in the project through the use of expatriate
technical assistance personnel already working with Ardhi, who were funded
by multi- and bilateral aid agencies; the filling of vacancies within the
Ministry through inter-agency transfers and the hiring of consultants. The
longer term need was to be addressed through the training program for civil
and sanitary assistants and the expansion of Ardhi Institute's facilities.
6.02       Ardhi was to be the executing agency with overall responsibility
for the project.  The newly established sites and services section within
it was responsible for planning, designing, and constructing the infra-
structure and community facilities in consultation with concerned minis-
tries. As implementation progressed beyond the design and installation of
infrastructure, however, unforeseen weaknesses within Ardhi itself and the
institutional system as a whole became apparent. The urban councils, which
used to play an important coordinative role had been abolished and the
system had become fragmented. Although it was technically responsible for
coordination of project implementation, Ardhi had no authority to assume
this role. Furthermore, the system had never been designed to cope with a
program of this magnitude and its fragmented nature made it difficult to
address capacity constraints, and to secure accountability.
A. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi)
6.03       At the time of appraisal there were serious staff shortages in
practically all specialist cadres within the Ministry.   It was 30% below
its establishment of professional staff for lands, surveying, town planning
and valuation and many senior positions were filled by underqualified
officers. In order to ensure timely and satisfactory implementation of the
project, Ardhi was required to fill the vacancies within the newly-created
site and services section by June 1975. However, not only was the Ministry
unable to hire the new staff required, it was also unable to retain the
staff it already had.   The post of project accountant, for example, was
filled by four different persons within the first two years of implementa-
tion.  The Ministry also found that positions which they did not succeed in
filling one year were likely to be cancelled in subsequent fiscal years.
6.04       As the program progressed Ardhi was found to be ill-equipped to
deal with the comfmnity-oriented outreach needs that are critical to this
type of project, as it had no established positions for sociologists or
social workers. The problem was particularly difficult to solve as project
unit costs were not financed as part of the project.  The Association had
only an agreement that the Government would adequately staff' the unit.
The definition of adequacy remained a point of debate between the Associa-
tion and the Government.



- 30 -
6.05       The project unit was also an integral part of the Ministry and
shared administrative services with other divisions and departments.   It
was therefore affected by the unmet needs within the environment as a
whole. Vehicles and equipment purchased from the proceeds of the credit,
for example, were administered as part of the general pool.  Although the
project unit staff had "priority" for their use, they often had no trans-
portation available to visit project sites or other Ministries. As overall
economic conditions deteriorated also, fuel was rationed.   Each vehicle
gets only 50 litrev. per week and the vehicles are periodically immobilized.
6.06      Despite the fact that the project unit did not have the capacity
for adequately implementing all aspects of the project, the Ministry was
extremely reluctant to hire consultants and often tried to undertake tasks
which it could not manage.   The capacity constraints in the project unit
aggravated other problems such as that of coordination, as there were
generally not enough staff available to visit the sites or Ministries whose
work they were coordinating. Similarly the design of the community facili-
ties was significantly delayed as the staff was unable to keep the whole
program moving at once, and all initial efforts were focused on the instal-
lation of infrastructure.
6.07       As part of the second project, the unit has been reorganized, it
has been upgraded to divisional status and additional staff has been hired
to handle the previously neglected social inputs.   Staff positions were
specified in the project proposal and salary and overhead costs are includ-
ed in the budget.  These changes have led to some improvements, but the
framework is still limited. The recreation of urban authorities has, how-
ever, established the basis for more significant changes. Several project
unit staff members recently undertook a study tour of other urban projects
in the region and have developed detailed proposals for further restructur-
ing.    Their recommendations  include:    strengthening  of  the cadre of
community  development  workers;   provision  of  assistance  to  project
beneficiaries on the sites; and, increasing the involvement of the
community in project formulation and implementation under the third
project.
B. Tanzania Housing Bank
6.08      As indicated in'Section III C, THB's active participation was de-
layed by external factors beyond its control.   Its performance, however,
was also affected by internal factors, notably a rapid turnover of staff
within the sites and services unit and its continued use of criteria, pro-
cedures and requirements which are cumbersome, and unsuitable for the
target group and inappropriate for Tanzanian conditions.
6.09       Staffing of the THB project unit in Dar es Salaam, the regional
offices and coordination of their act'.vities proved to be major problems
during implementation. There were also frequent staff changes within the
unit.   Between 1979 and 1982, for example,  the unit's coordinator was
changed four times.  Up until 1980, applications in the regional centers
were all sent to Dar es Salaam for approval. Repayment records were also
centralized and the staff of the regional offices were therefore not made
aware of delinquencies early enough for them to take advantage of their
proximity to the beneficiaires to follow-up in a timely manner.  it also



- 31 -
appears that Regional Staff were often unaware of the goals and concepts
underlying the program and were therefore unable to apply the special pro-
cedures developed for project beneficiaries or to actively promote the
program.   The THB has been delinquent in submission of audited accounts,
and the site and service unit's management was not responsible for
monitoring repayment by project beneficiaries. Reporting on cost recovery
was initially weak and then stopped altogether. The program's coordinator
therefore never maintained a comprehensive overview of the program.  In
general, the management system did not lend itself to the experimentation
and innovation needed by the program.
6.10        THB's procedures and requirements have remained stringent and
conservative. For example, THB still requires a title for a site and ser-
vices urban house loan, although it has established less stringent criteria
for rural areas and upgraded urban squatter areas.   This is despite the
fact that obtaining a title can easily take up to three years' effort.
Even when an applicant already has a title, THB's own procedures then take
another year to be completed.  Without fundamental changes in either the
land title system or in THB's procedures the THB is unlikely to make a
significant impact on the provision of low-income housing.
C. Coordination
6.11      Responsibility for local administrative tasks were shared between
regional offices of the sectoral Ministries.   The Regional Development
Directors (RDD) were under the RDDs, but for land matters they reported to
Ardhi.  The RLDO's prepared the documents for registration and issue of
titles in the regions. Occupancy rights were registered and titles issued
from Ardhi's headquarters in Dar es Salaam.  The Treasury was responsible
for collection of service charge payments.  With the reinstatement of the
urban councils in 1978, the duality of reporting-to the City Director (in
place of the RDD) and Ardhi has continued. Plot allocation authority has
not been clearly delineated.
6.12      Ardhi's Regional Land Development Offices in the regions did not
include any individual with specific operational responsibility for such
a program in urban areas nor any formal mechanism for the consideration of
multi-faceted programs. Once the site and services unit had completed the
infrastructure work, which was within its sphere of authority, the
sub-projects virtually came to a halt.  Follow-up within the program was
not high on the list of priorities of other departments and divisions of
Ardhi or other Government agencies involved in implementation.
6.13       THB and Ardhi's inability to come up with a workable alternative
to registered titles as collateral for urban house loans, or improvement in
the title issuance system, meant that Ardhi's Lands department remained on
THEB's critical path. This created a delay of up to three years for project
beneficiaries.



- 32 -
6.14      Monitoring of the program and identification of bottlenecks were
also difficult as there was no system for recording the progress of appli-
cations as they went through a series of Government offices for relatively
simple tasks to be performed.  Follow-up by the Government agencies in-
volved was also made difficult by the lack of a house registration
system. It was generally difficult to ensure that correspondence would get
to the right person through the post office box system, or to be able to
contact an individual personally. These problems are being addressed by
the consolidation unit established in the Dar es Salaam city council and
through the house registration program being undertaken with proceeds from
the second credit.
6.15       The recreation of urban authorities has reestablished a basis
for coordinating program elements and monitoring progress.  So far, how-
ever, only the enabling legislation has been passed. The regulations for
its implementation still have to be developed, published and interpreted.
It will take some time for appropriate administrative systems and proce-
dures to be reestablished in the newly-recreated councils--the central
Government agencies will also have to reorient themselves towards playing
a supportive rather than a direct role.  The Housing Directorate within
Ardhi, for example, has started to actively consider ways in which its
technical staff might act as trainers of and consultants to local autho-
rities' staff. There are a number of alternatives to be compared and con-
sidered and the process could greatly benefit from external support.
D. Conclusions
6.16       The means of achieving the long-term institutional development
goals were not as well developed during project preparation as they might
have been had we been more experienced at the time, or, if the Government
already had a clear policy for which it was seeking efficient or effective
ways of implementation. Yet, despite the shortcomings of the preraration
process and the difficult period within which implementation took place,
the project has successfuly supported two important areas of institution
building: (i) the establishment of a cadre of experienced professionals;
and (ii) the development of appropriate sectoral policies.
6.17        The project unit, which has now been given divisional status
within the Ministry, is now capable of developing an ongoing program for
the provision of housing for the nation's population, particularly the
urban poor.  They have developed problem-solving and programming skills
through their hands-on experience, working initially with consultants, but
later on, on their own.   Although they still need the assistance of
consultants, the need is greatly reduced in the policy sphere and more
restricted to technical areas.   They have been playing an increasingly
important role in the development of proposals for subsequent projects,
such as the ongoing second project and proposals for a third.



- 33 -
6.18        The Housing Development Department, under which the Sites and
Services Division now falls, is headed by the previous project manager.
The department has updated the National Urban Development Strategy and
developed a Housing Policy, both of which have been accepted by Cabinet.

VII. ROLE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
7.01      IDA's involvement in the Housing and Urban Development sector in
Tanzania was propitiously timed.  The Government had already made housing
for the low income majority a priority within its development plan, but
little progress had been made. The Association's main contribution was its
introduction of the concept of affordability as the guiding principle for
developing the program.
7.02      In retrospect, however, we might have placed more emphasis on the
community development components; used a longer time frame in the design of
the project; and, been more conservative in estimating implementation capa-
city. These short comings can be attributed to this having been a new area
of lending for the Association, and a new area of operation for the
Ministry. During implementation, however, the supervision teams were able
to bring the benefit of their exposure to a wide range of projects to bear
on the problems being encountered.
7.03       The design of the physical components, which received a lot of
attention, has become more routine.  During the preparation of the second
project, the staff was able to concentrate more on the community develop-
ment elements and to devise appropriate changes in the institutional rela-
tionships to address the weakness in the original design.  Our ability to
make this on-going contribution was greatly facilitated by the good rela-
tionship we had established with the staff of Ardhi, especially the project
unit.
7.04       During impl#mentation, approximatly 77 person-days of Bank staff
time was spent in the field each year and no mission failed to include at
least one participant who had been on the previous mission. The Associa-
tion's principal contribution during this stage was the provision of tech-
nical assistance, and advice for the resolution of critical problems, the
development of terms of reference for consultants, procurement issues and
contract monitoring. Where the specific skills needed were unavailable in-
house, the Association used consultants to assist in supervision and to
advise the government (Mission Data Table).
7.05       Although the Association's involvement has generally been posi-
tive, its image created some difficulties for the project unit in Ardhi--
when the urban councils were recreated, the council officials had some
difficulty in reconciling the modest standards with IDA funding.

VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The project, which was one of the first generation of urban proj-
ects funded by the Bank Group, has provided a number of useful general
lessons which are applicable to similar projects and which are worth high-
lighting here:
A. Civil Works
8.02        It is perhaps noteworthy and not atypical of first generation
urban projects that the civil works or physical components went more
smoothly  than  the  'software' elements.    Consultants  and contractors'
performance while not trouble-free, was generally satisfactory.   Greater
difficulties  were  encountered  in  developing  an  adequate  community
development support network, initiating cost recovery, and in sustaining an
adequate level of infrastructure maintenance.
B. Cost Recovery
8.03       The practice in the Bank at the time of project preparation was
to avoid subsidies via general revenue, especially for urban projects.
This was because the subsidy would ultimately come from the rural areas in
agriculturally-based economies.  In Tanzania user charges were the excep-
tion rather than the rule and the technical solution developed was there-
fore an enclave one. This created an inequitable situation, was difficult
to administer and, in any case, could only have a limited impact. The time
frame for implementation also proved to be unrealistic as it did not take
into account the time needed to allow for the necessary political
approvals, and development of approFriate house registration systems,
collection procedures and staff establisl=ent.
8.04       The project experience suggests that in similar situations, the
current and proposed fiscal context needs to be taken into consideration
explicitly.   Where the current system diverges significantly from the
Association's requirements and the Association and the borrower feel that a
change would be appropriate, a longer time-frame should be used to allow
for its development.   This may mean delayed appraisal or a period of
technical assistance (in various forms) preceeding it. Performance targets
can then be established for the project implementation period.
C. The Community Development Input
8.05      The need to provide advisory services and technical assistance to
project beneficiaries was a new concept in Tanzania and was not initially
recognized as being important. As implementation has taken place, however,
the need has become increasingly apparent.  As the program progresses in
Tanzania, this aspect will have to be given closer attention.  This is
already being done in similar projects elsewhere.



- 36 -
D. The Institutional Framework
8.06         The problems of accountability and coordination encountered
during project implementation emphasize the importance of clear definitions
of responsibilities compatible with institutional mandates. Accountability
for delivering a plot through the various stages of development, allocation
and registration was never assigned to any agency.   These fragmented
responsibilities made it difficult to pinpoint and resolve bottlenecks in
the delivery system.   Where different agencies are responsible for the
various steps in a service delivery system, such as housing, the
possibility of reallocating or delegating responsibilities ought to be
explored further in future projects.
8.07          The difficulties encountered in having the agreed modified
building standards accepted by all parties involved suggest that more
should be done during implementation.  This is especially important when
the branches of government involved in negotiations differ from those to be
involved in implementation; where staff changes take place frequently
within the system or, where--as in this case-new branches of government
are created after &ppraisal. Amendments to specifications and legislation
should, ideally, be done prior to negotiations; or, at a minimum, made part
and parcel of the implementation process. This is always easier said than
done.
8.08      The project experience, and the institutional changes which took
place during implementation, have also provided some useful insights con-
cerning the division of responsibilities between central and local govern-
ment agencies. Policy development and technical advice appear to be appro-
priate for a centralized unit, whereas day-to-day tasks such as comotnity
development, supervision of contractors and project monitoring might be
better accomplished by the agency closest to the beneficiaries and the
project sites.
E. Institution Building
8.09       The project was unavoidably expert-intensive, especially during
the initial period, and this is likely to be true of most first projects in
any sector.  When this situation occurs, it might be appropriate to place
more emphasis on complementary institution-building components.
F. The Macro-Economic Framework
8.10      In keeping with the general practice, it was assumed at appraisal
that the macro-economic framework would hold constant throughout implemen-
tation.   However,  dramatic changes occurred and these had significant
impacts on the project. We might usefully try to develop approaches which
are more compatible with fluctuating economic conditions since these are
likely to continue in the region for some time.
8.11       Steps have already been taken to put the lessons gained from the
first project into practice.   No panacea has been found, but we have
expanded our repertoire of basic principles for guiding the progress of
such programs.

An additional para. as follows:
C. Urban Councils
6.11. Although the urban councils were re-instated in 1978 they
were not brought into the Project main stream by way of participation in
decision making and/or implementation. Infrastructure, where completed,
was handed over to these councils for maintenance. This situation is
partially rectified in Dar es Salaam since the creation of the Consolida-
tion Unit within the Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC) under Urban II.
13.       Page 31, original para 6.11 will be para 6.12 and to read as
follows:
6.12 Responsibility for local administrative tasks were shared
between Regional Offices of the sectoral ministries. The Regional
Development Directors (RDD) were under the Prime Minister's Office. The
Regional Land Development Officers (RLD) were under RDD, but for land
matters they were under Ardhi. With the reinstatement of town councils In
1978, the duality in 'reporting' to the city director by the planning and
land officers, and also to Ardhi has continued. The plot allottment
authority was not dileneated, and functioned at several levels. The land
officers prepared the documents for registration and issue of titles.
Occupancy rights were registered and titles issued from Ardhi's
headquarters in Dar es Salaam. The Treasury was responsible for collection
of service charge payment.
Para. 6.13 same as para. 6.12 in PCR draft.
Para. 6.14 same as para. 6.13 in PCR draft.

I have carefull  rend the draft report of the first
National Sites and Services Project and found that the
basic inform<-tion that we supplied to the supervision
missions of the World Bank has been appropriately
incorporated,
The report is therefore a reflection of a general
consensus between the two parties and I would be glad
to obtain a copy of the final report after it has been
distributed to the Executive Directors.
