REPORT AID R1CONMDATION OF THE PRESIIT
TO THE EIUTrIVE DIRECTRS
ON A PROPOSED DEVEIDPKEN CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TAIZANIA
FOR A NATIONAL SITES AID SEICES PROJECT
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent
of US$8.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a National Sites
and Services Project. Some $2.0 million of the credit would be relent
to the Tanzanian Housing Bank (THB) for 25 years, including a five-
year grace period, with interest at three percent per annum. THEB would
onlend these funds to cooperative housing societies and individuals as
house construction loans at six percent per annum for up to 20 years
with a one-year grace period.
PART I - THE ECONOMIS
General
2. The last full Economic Report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was fol-
lowed by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) which was distributed on
December 11, 1972 and which was especially prepared for the East African
Consultative Group meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. An agriculture
rural development sector mission visited Tansania during September/
October 1973; its report is expected to be issued about the middle of
1974. Daring 1974 we shall vndertake a missidon to study the industrial
and mining sectors.
3. Tanzania celebrated ita first decade of independence in December
1971. In the past 31 years gross national product increased in real
terms by some 65 percent to the present level of about $1.5 billion.
During the same period, life expectancy at birth increased from 35 to
413 years, infant mortality declined from 250 to 160 per thousand live
births, maternal mortality declined from 4.7 to 2.7 per thousand de-
liveries, and the primary school enrollment rate increased from about
28 to 37 percent of the relevant age group. While this sauple of economic
and social indicators shows that significant progress has been made,
it also gives some idea of the magnitude and difficulty of the develop-
ment task facing the country. For example, while GNP grew at 4.7 percent
per annum in real terms during these years, these gains were to a large
extent offset by the growth of population, with the result that per
capita income increased at only 2.4 percent per anum. Tanzania is
one of the 25 least developed countries.
4.   Tanzania has a one-party system which is embodied in the con-
stitution. The party, the Tanganyika Africa National Union (TANU),
is a well organized mass party and is actively engaged at the grass
roots in the promotion of popular involvement In the national development
effort, and within the party democratic principles are belng strictly



- 2 -
adhered to. in econoiic policy making, the long-termn objective of
social equality prevails over econonic interests of miinority groups;
scme progress towards reducing inequality of income distribution within
the category of employed workers has been made, but large gaps continue
to exist between urban and rural standards of living.
Economic Performance and Resource Mobilization
5,   Tanzania's economic performance in recent years has been
characterized by high marginal savings, relatively low returns on
investment, and rapid institutional change. The growth of production,
however, has been modest in most sectors, especially in agriculture.
The cornbination of moderate production growth rates and a very ambitious
in'xest.rent progra-n has led to severe pressure on resources. This pressure
has heen partly alleviated by steadily increasing external capital inflows
and, until recently, by an improvement in the country's terms of trade.
Although favorable current world market prices for several of Tanzania's
princlpal exports and the growing contribution for local project costs by
foreimn donors, have helpe(d to build up external reserves equivalent to
about three months' imports, the recent rise in oil prices has drastically
changed the situation. It is estimated that the foreign exchange cost
of the oil price increase is in the region of $58 mnillion per year. This
comfpares with a net resource transfer from the World Bank Group of about
$15 raillion per annun and a total net capital inflow of around $60
miilicn per annum. The scope for cutting back on domestic oil consumption
without reducing production is extremely limited. Tne combined effect of
the oil price rise, the expected large food import requirements, partially
due to the drought in the north of the country, for the current year and
other relative price changes is expected to cause a US$.30 - US$40 million
dron in reserves during 19i4. Although the problem ap,pears tolerable for
the next year or two, special measures will have to be taken to rectify the
situation during this period. A task force jointly manned by the Govern-
nent and the Ban3k is currently assessing the short, medium and long-run
effects of the oil price increases with a view to fornulating  policy
recommurendations.  Possible alternati-ves include the development of domnestic
energv resources, including coal and hydroelectric power, and placing a
further emphasis on industries which produce exports or substitute for
imports.
6. In terms of foreign aid disburselments, the People's Republic of
China was Tanzania's principal donor, until the recent completion of
the Tanzanian portion of the Tan-Zam railway. In terms of outstanding
loans and credits, however, the Bank Group is the largest creditor
to Tanzania followed Dy Sweden, norway and the Soviet Thicn. Includin-
a notional one-third  share of the debt of the East African Community
Coriporations, the IBRD is presently carrying 14 percent of Tanzania's
outstanding ex-ternal debt and IDA 16 percent; the IBRD share is expected



-3-
to rise to about 20 percent in the next five years, and the IDA share to
remain about the same. The share of debt service payments to the Bank is
at present about 10 percent of total debt service payments; the correspond-
ing share for IDA is about 2 percent. These two figures are projected to
rise to about 20 percent and 3 percent, respectively, by 1980. Most
capital aid to Tanzania is made available on very favorable financial
terms, although about 50 percent of the total is tied to procurement in
the donor country. Supplier credits have been kept to the minimum. In
addition to seeking as favorable a blend as possible and the minimum of
tying, the Government has attempted to secure donors' agreement to
simplify the procedures associated with the use of committed aid. For
exmaple, Swedish assistance is now given within the terms of a frame
agreement, which allows the Government to set its own priorities in the
use of SIDA funds and allows considerable flexibility in the switching of
such finance between the various projects and programs. The overall debt
service ratio has declined in recent years owing to buoyant export ear-
ings; it is currently about 5 to 6 percent and is expected to remain
below 10 percent at least until 1985. In view of this low debt service
ratio, there is scope for a modest amount of lending to Tanzania on
conventional terms, particularly if such lending is for export prolnoting
or import substituting activities.
Tanzania's high rate of investment during the last five years
has not been reflected in high growth in production -- at least not
as yet -- partly because there was a heavy bias towards social and
economic infrastructure with long gestation periods. A substantial
proportion of total investment has been undertaken to provide a viable
alternative outlet to the sea to neighboring landlocked Zambia after
Southern Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence of 1965.
Economic and political ties between Zambia and Tanzania are growing
stronger every year. As a consequence of the lower than expected growth
rate, the Government has decided to shift its investment emphasis
to more productive quick yielding investments, particularly those
which generate increased export earnings. The effects of these new
policies can already be seen in the rural sector and in the Bank
Group's own lending program.
8.   The budgetary position which has been adversely affected by
sluggish economic growth in recent years coupled with high levels
of development and recurrent expenditure, remains extremely tight.
The Government does not have many remaining possibilities to increase
revenues. In view of the already high marginal savings rate, the scope
for additional taxation is very limited. Even with a decline in
the rate of investment, with the escalation of fuel prices, Tanzania
will still require a continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign
exchange component of high priority projects it it is to achieve
its development targets; financing of local expenditures will therefore
be justified.
9. Financial discipline in the regions, Central Government Ministries,
and many state corporations remains a problem, probably because
scarce accounting and auditing skills are now even more thinly spread.
There is a general serious shortage of many professional skills. The



situation has been aggravated by the departure of many Asians and the
Government's reluctance to recruit abroad.   However, this reluctance
is now dimi-nishing as part oi an effort to accelerate project pre-
paration and implementation.
'O. President Tlyerere recently announced that following a reviewz,
ihe C-overnment has decided to move the capital of' Tanzania from
Dar es Salaam to Dodoma.   By moving the capital city to the center
or the country and so closer to the bulk of the rural population,
it is the exDectation that the Government wrill becoimie more responsive
to the needs of the rural sector.  The Government presently plans
to make the move over a ten year period. No accurate estimates of
the total costs involved are yet available but in view of the scarcity
oi investment resources in Tanzania, it is likely that the transfer
of the capital will take much longer than planned; in addition, the
nuiber of Governiment orT'ices moved may be fewer than is presently
envisaged.
11. The administrative structure and many of the functions of
Government were decentralized to the regions in July 1972. This
was done to make the Government more responsive to the needs of rural
development. It is still far too early to assess the success or
otlherwise of this decentralization. As expected,  problems of
coordination between the center and the regions have occurred, and
the transfer of high ranking officials from Dar es Salaam to the
ru3-al areas has had its inevitable, but one hopes only short-term,
eff'ect on the smooth functioning of Central Govermment. Some dis-
location in project irmlementation has also been experienced. In
some regions the new Government structure is already showing its
potential to be more responsive and relevant to the needs of the
rural sector. Several rural develonment programs are now being
prepared in the regions and Bank Group) finance is being sought for
some ol them.  It has become apparent that the severe shortage of
regional technical expertise will inhibit the ability of' the new
decentralized authorities to plan and execute rural projects; progress
in regional development will, therefore, inevitably be patchy, re-
flcting the local availability of the required expertise. WJays in
whrich the Bain Group and other donors might assist in alleviating
these constraints are currently being explored with the Government.
Expropriations
12.  In April 1971 legislation (The Acquisition of Buildings Act)
was enacted empowering the President on behalf of the state to acquire
any rental or commerial property the constriuction cost of which was
over 100,000 Tanzanian Shillings ($lh,000). About 3,000 properties
were acquired under the Act. About 560 claims, including less than
10 percent on behalf of foreign owners, were lodged in respect of the



- 5 -
actual acquisition itselr or on the amount of compensation. These
claims, including the foreign cases, have either been settled or are
in the process of being settled in accordance with the provision of
the Act. The Government has recently expropriated about 50 large-
scale farms in the Moshi-Arusha area of northern Tanzania. The Govern-
ment is presently making an assessment of the value of these properties
and negotiations on compensation are expected to commence soon.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
13. Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962. Beginning with
an IDA credit for education in 1963, it has so far received 15 credits
and three Bank loans amounting to $172.1 million. In addition, Tanzania
has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million which
have been extended for the development of common services operated on
a regional basis by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their association
with the East African Conmunity. The only IFC investments in Tanzania
to date, totaling $4.4 million, were made in the Kilombero Sugar Company
in 1960 and 1964. In 1969, IFC and other investors sold their interest
in the Company to the Goverment. Annex II contains summary statements
of Bank loans and IDA credits in Tanzania and the East African Com-
munity Organizations as of March 31, 1974 and notes on tne execution of
ongoing projects.
14. Our lendirg program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian Govern-
ment attaches to agricultural development is increasingly focusing on
directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to the end
of FY72, 10 out of 14 loans and credits had been made for infrastructure.
All but one of the loans to the East African Community Organizations,
of which Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-guarantor, had been extended
for improvements in transportation and comunications. However, the
approval by the Executive Directors Of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project
(Credit No. 217 TA) in October 1970 opened a new phase in our lending
for such directly productive activities.  The Smallholder Tea Development
Project (Credit No. 287 TA) was approved in March 1972. A Second Live-
stock Project (Credit No. 382 TA) was approved early in April 1973.
The Geita Cotton Project (Credit No. 454 TA) approved in January 1974
constitutes the beginning of a major effort to expand cotton production.
A project to expand cashew nut production and processing and a proposed
rural development project were appraised in October 1973. A sugar project
was also appraised in December 1973. Preparations of a proposed dairy
project and a second rural development project are under way.
15. Our Regional Mission in Eastern Africa was involved in the prepa-
ration of six of the above projects. Our capacity to provide such as-
sistance has proved to be particularly valuable in a country where project
preparation capacity is, and for ane time will be, limited. Tanzania



is developing an institutional structure, stressing greater regionaliza-
tion and development of ujamz.a villages, designed to promote and respond
to development initiatives. These institutions are still in their
formative stages, and related organizational and staffing difficulties
have sometimes resulted in the project delays referred to in Annex II.
In recent months Bank Group staff have held intensive discussions with
the Government on ways in which these implementation bottlenecks can
be alleviated. As part of' this exercise, a procurement and disburse-
ment workshop was organized in Dar es Salaam in late August 1973 for
the relevant Tanzanian staff engaged on Bank Group projects. In addition,
the Government has recently instituted a high level monthly review for
all externally aided projects. As a result of these efforts, it is
expected that project implementation should now improve.
16. Tanzania's education and training programs are expected to solve
the manpower problem in the longer run, but meanwhile there will continue
to be a need for technical assistance in planning and implementation
if the difficulties in executing projects are to be overcome. We are
exploring with the Government how assistance of this kind can be strength-
ened and best fitted to Tanzania. Through participation in their
projects we have supported Tanzania's new development institutions at
an early stage. Our supervision ol the projects has resulted in bringing
to light, earlier than might have happened otherwise, that some of these
institutions are facing significant diff'iculty in executing all the
projects they have undertaken. Because of our involvement we have
been able to help the Government in its consideration of how to overcome
this problem whose solution is fundamental to rapid development.
17. The proposed urban sites and services project would be the Bank
Group's first lending to Tanzania for urban development. The Credit
for the Tanzania Investment Bank (Credit No. 460 TA) approved in Feb-
ruary 1974 was the Bank Group's first lending in the industrial sector
in Tanzania. A proposed pro5ect for textile development is presently
under preparation. Other projects outside the agricultural sector which
are expected to be ready for consideration in the near future include
a proposed highway maintenance project and a proposed supplementary
loan to complete the Kidatu Hydroelectric Project (Loan No. 715 TA).
Although no projects are planned in the near future for the common services
organizations of the East African Community, the Bank, through its super-
vision missions of ongoing operations, is discussing further assistance
for telecommunications, industry and port development. Additional
loans to the East African Railways Corporation, however, will have to
await resolution of the financial and operational problems being en-
countered by that Corporation. The main operational problems consist
ol an inadequate tariff structure, inefficient use of rolling stock,
and differences between the Partner States about how the railways
should be managed. The Partner States are very much alive to these
problems and have arranged to engage consultants to recommend solutions.

PART III - HOUSING AND URBAN DEVEIOPMENT IN TANZANIA
General Background
18. Tanzania has a population oI about 14 million with an urban pop-
ulation of 900,000 or about 6.5 percent of the total. The population
growth rate in the urban areas is more than two-and-a-half times the
national rate of about 2.5 percent per annum. Nearly three-quarters
of the urban increase is the result of ru.ral urban migration. The
Government's national development strategy emphasizes increased agricul-
tural production and the improvement of rural services and amenities,
with the hope that this migration will be checked. Tanzania's urban
policy seeks to promote new urban growth centers outside Dar es Salaam,
which currently has 55 percent of the total urban population, by its
emphasis on regional development and its policy to locate industry in
10 urban growth centers outside Dar es Salaam. So far, the Government
has not been very successful in implementing this policy, due in part
to the lead time required to reverse trends based on economic and
historical forces.
19. While the ten regional centers grew at an average annual rate of
6.5 percent during 1957-67, Dar es Salaam grew at a rate of 8 percent,
reaching 11 percent between 1965-67. If these growth rates continue,
Tanzania's urban population will double every 11 years and Dar as
Salaam will double every 9 years, reaching one million people by 1983.
Urban growth, particularly in Dar as Salaam, has far out-paced the
construction of low-cost housing and related infrastructure. As a
result, squatter settlements with little or no basic infrastructure
and community facilities are mushrooming. In 1969 over 40 percent of
the housing containing an estimated 65 percent of Dar es Salaam's
population was located in squatter areas. Upcountry centers have
similar problems. Mwanaa, Tanzania's third largest town (estimated
population 55,800) is growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent.
Located on Lake Victoria, it is the major regional manufacturing and
trade center, as well as a principal port and rail terminus. Due to
a shortage of inexpensive housing and surveyed plots, squatting has
proliferated. Mbeya, strategically located on the Tan-Zam Highway
and Railway, has grown in recent years at an average annual rate of
7 percent to its current level of 21,000. As in Mwanza, most of the
population has been forced to provide its own shelter in poorly
serviced squatter areas.
20. A direct result of these high rates of urbanization has been the
creation of a severe nationwide housing shortage. The Second Five-Year
Plan estimates that 20,000 units p.a.(including 13,700 low-cost units)
in urban areas are required throughout the country. The country-wide
waiting list for National Housing Corporation units is over 24,000,
nearly 19,000 of which are for houses in Dar es Salaam. Another waiting
list for surveyed plots in Dar es Salaam, dating back to 1967, consists
of about 18,000 applications.  There is probably some overlap between tkhs8
lists and some applicants undoubtedly have died, returned to the rural
areas, or are no longer interested or able to secure a plot. Never-
theless, these lists indicate a substantial unfulfilled dmand.



- 8 -
National Sites and Services Program
21. Recognizing that its current housing programs were not meeting the
needs of the low-income segments of the urban population, the Government
adopted a new housing strategy based on the sites and services approach.
This approach, an extension of the ujamnaa movement to the urban areas,
is seen as the key to the provision of low-cost housing and as a solution
to the squatter problem.  In 1973, the Itinistry of Lands, Housing and
Urban Development (known by its Swahili abbreviation of Ardhi),
prepared a four-vear sites and services program for ten regional centers
to provide 12,500 plots an1nually with basic infrastructure and communitv
facilities. The proposed project is the first step in the implementation
of the GovernmentAs program, with project sites in Dar es Salaam and the
two regional centers of Mwanza and mbeya.
22.  Hecognizing the importance of self-help contribution to alleviate
the housing shortage, squatter settlements will be upgraded where
spontaneously organized. efforts have resulted in well-constructed housing
and viable neighborhoods.  This is an important departure from previous
policies of squatter demolition and resettlement which the Government
found too costly and socially disruptive. Under the proposed project
three such settlements will be upgraded. Basic infrastructure and
community facilities will be provided and sturdy housing will be con-
served and improved, resulting in a significant cost saving. An addi-
tional benefit will be the preservation of viable communities which ofter.
serve to integrate the rural migrant into the urban community.
Tanzania Housing Bank
23. To meet the credit requirements of low-income households for con-
struction loans, the Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) was established in
1973 replacing the Permanent Housing Finance Company of Tanzania (PHFCT),
a cormmercial institution ;jointly owned by the Goverinent and the Common-
we,alth Development Corporation (U.K.).  The main purpose of 'nB is to
mobilize domestic savings and foreign funds for financing low-income
housing for individuals and cooperative groups.   THB provides technical
and financial assistance lor sites and services projects, ujamaa
villages, and other owner--occupied housing schemes. Mbreover, it
promotes the use of local building materials, encourages the construction
of housing types best suited to local conditions, and fosters the
minimizing of building costs.
2L4. THB- is a corpora.te body wi- more than 50 percent of its share
capital owned by the Government. It is governed by a Board of Directors,
consisting of 8 to 12 members appointed by the .nister of Finance
with the Chairman appointed by the President.  One of the Directors
is the Principal Secretary of Ardhi, thus ensuring coordination of
po';icy and programs between Ardhi and THB. THB is currently receiving
techni.cal. assistance from SIDA ancl NORAD and has inherited well-trained
and qualified adminvistrative and operational staff from PHFCT.  Additional
staff are being recruited and trained, placing THB in a sound position
to undertake it's enlarged objectives.



25. THB offers two major types of loans: (i) housing loans at 6
percent per annum interest for up to 20 years to meet needs of low-
income groups and (ii) loans at 9 percent per annum interest for up
to 10-20 years for individuals or institutional borrowers who wish
to invest in expensive housing or commercial buildings. Loans are
provided for the construction of low-income housing by participants
in sites and services projects throughout the country. Lending
procedures, particularly suited for individuals and cooperative groups
in such projects, have been prepared. All loan applications must be
accompanied by a long-term Right-of-Occupancy, issued by the regional
administrations, and all loans must be secured by a first mortgage.
THB must satisfy itself that the borrower has the ability to make
repayments without undue hardship, and that adequate provisions for
the enforcement of the repayment exist. In addition, THB ensures
that the proceeds oX any loan are used solely for the purpose for
which it was granted.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
26. An appraisal report entitled "Tanzania - National Sites and Services
Project" dated May 14, 1974, is being circulated separately. A Credit
and Project Summary is provided as Annex III to this report.
27. A mission from the Transportation and Urban Projects Department
identified the project in February 1973, and it was appraised in the
field in August/September 1973. Negotiations for the proposed credit
were held in Washington, D. C. in April 1974. The Tanzania delegation
was headed by Mr. B. A. Sikilo, Principal Secretary, Ardhi.
Objectives
28. The proposed project is an initial step in implementing the Govern-
ment't nation-wide low-cost housing program, with project sites in Dar
es Salaam and the two regional centers of Aaansa and Mbeya. Although
it will not satisfy the total demand for serviced and improved plots,
the funds, technical assistance and training support provided under the
project will enable the Government to strengthen its institutional
capacity to plan and implement an expanded program in the future. The
provision of surveoyed plots, basic infrastructure, commnmity facilities,
and access to credit for construction will pormit low-income households
in planned areas and squatter settloments to constract houses and improve
their living conditions on a elf-help basis and at acceptable per plot
costs.



- 10 -
Project Description
29. The proposed project will be executed over a three-year period
(1974-77) and will consist of the following:
(i) Mew Sites: about 10,600 newly serviced plots located as
follows: 7,450 plots on three site8 in Dar es Salaam (Sinza, Kijitonyama
and Mikocheni); about 2,300 plots in Mwanza (Nyakato), and about 870
new plots in Plbeya (Mwanjelwa).
(ii) Squatter InMrovements: improvements to basic infrastructure
facilities and additional services in two existing squatter settleaments
of Dar as Salaam (Manzese A and B) and the Hwanjelwa settlement in
Mbeya. These improvements will affect about 8,800 dwellings.
(iii) Community Facilities and Ecguipaent: ccnstruction of eleven
community education centers, one health center, seven dipensaries and
eleven markets on the seven project sites.  Purchase of coss pit eaptiers
and refuse collection trucks and equipment.
(iv) Construction Loans: assistance to THB in financing construction
and house improvement loans for low inc ce households on the project sites.
Loans will be extended by THB for purchase of cement, galvanied iron
roofing and other building materials.
(v) Training and Monitoring: a training program for technical
staff of Ardhi and expansion of the physical facilities for the town
planning program of the Ardhi Institute (a training school of the
Ministry), as well as monitoring of the project by the Economic Research
Bureau of the University oZ Dar es Salaam.
(vi) Nutrition: a pilot project to improve the nutritional
awareness of households in the sites and services areas, and
(v) Consultants' Services: consultants for the design and
detailed engineering of basic infrastructure and community, facilities,
preparation of a follow-up site and services project and overaUl project
sapervision.
Project Sites
30. The seven proposed sites were selected after a careful evaluation
in accordance with three basic criteria: (i) availability of land,
suitably sized and situated which could be developed economically for
low-income housing; (ii) suitable Boil and ground water conditions to
enable natural drainage of the area and (iii) location relative to job
opportunitiss, transportation facilities, and off-site infrastructure



such as access roads, water, power and sewerage mains. For squatter
settlement areas, an additional selection criterion was the existence
of well-constructed housing and viable neighborhoods.
31. In Dar es Salaam, the five oites selected are located on the
principal roads to the city center and are near the rapidly developing
Ubungo indastrial area. With the completion of the port access road
in 1977, the sites will also be within a short commuting distance of
the existing major industrial area along Pugu road.  In Mwanza, the
site is located on the principal east-west route served by the public
transport system and near the Nyakato industrial area. In Mbeya, the
site is adjacent to the city center and in close proximity to the Tan-
Zam highway and railway.
Project Costs
32. Total project costs are estimated at $16.7 million, including
land acquisition costs of about $634,000 which will be borne in full
by the Government. The foreign exchange component of $3.9 million
(23 percent of total cost) is rolatively small due to the labor intensive-
ness of the project and the econoy of design standards.   The proposed
IDA credit of $8.5 million would finance the total estimated foreign
exchange component as well as $4.6 million equivalent of local cost,
and would amount to about 50 percent of the total project cost. IDA
will finance 65 percent of the costs of the infrastructure, ccmmunity
facilities, and the expansion of the Ardhi Institute, 75 percent of
consultant services, the full cost of equipment, and $2.0 million for
the construction loan funds for the THB. The breakdown of project
cost is given in Annex III.
Project Standards
(a) Individual Plots
33. The basic design unit is the ten-house cell for both new and
squatter improvement areas. The plot layouts and preliminary engineering
on four sites, i.e. two new (Sinsa and Kijitonyama) and two squatter
settlements (Manzese A and B), give a typical plot size of 288 m2. This
is lage in comparison to previous Bank/IDA financed projects (Senegal
150 m , Nicaragua nO m2 and Jamaica 94 m2), but is appropriate in the
Tanzanian context given the need to accommodate a traditional Swahili
house, the most prevalent type of low-cost house, which in constructed
of local materials and consists of four-six rooms separated by a corridor.
Such houses often lodge several families with provision for an outdoor
cooking area, a garden (shamba), and a pit latrine or aqua privy (septic
tank). Under present Government procedures a long-term Right-af-Occupancy



- 12 -
is required to undertake permanent construction and on the issuance of
this right the national building codes apply. These codes were framed
for high-income group housing and require a minimum investment of about
TSh 15,000 in the construction of a house. In the project area, however,
an improved Swahili house of cament, clay block walls, concrete
floor and galvanized iron roof is estimated to cost TSh 7,000 for a
four-room and TSh 9,000 for a six-room house. The Government has, there-
fore, agreed in Section 3.06(ii) of the Devel-opment Credit Agreement to
waive application of the building codes for low-income housing in the
project areas. In their stead, Government has under consideration the
preparation of house designs and building standards which will be used
on an interim basis for project housing. The Government has further
agreed in Section 3.06 (iii)of the Development Credit Agreement to revise
the building codes and, after review by the Association, to incorporate
the new standards into a revised code by December 31, 1976.
(b) Infrastructure and Community Facilities
3L4. The design standard§ for the basic intrastructure are such that
the per plot costs can be afforded by households at the lower end of
the household income scale. Each site will be provided with a network
of collector, primary, secondary and pedestrian roads; collector roads
wiLl be macadam-surfaced for bus traffice. Except at the Mikocheni site
in Dar es Salaasm where, due to a high water table, individual house water
connections are essential, water kiosks (stand pipes) will be provided.
for every 50 plots at a distance of 150 m. The power distribution system
will provide for streetlighting on the main roads and electricity for
the community facilities,. Provision will be made, however, for future
improvement to roads, drainage, and the installation of individual house
connections for water ancd electricity.
Organization and Execution
35. The executing agency for the project will be Ardhi which will have
overall responsibility for the project. Within Ardhi, a special Sites
and Services Section has been established for the detailed planning,
engineering and construction supervision of the project and for coordin-
ation with other concerned ministries in designing the community facil-
ities and with THB in providing construction loans. The Section will
also set up local site offices on each of the sites to provide technical
assistance to the individual plot occupants in self-help construction
and related matters. The Sites and Services Section is presently under-
staffed and the Government has agreed in Section 3.08 of the Development
Credit Agreement to adequately staff the Section and fill all vacancies
at the professional levels in the Section by June 30, 1975.



36. With the decentralization of governmaental functions, some Of tho
local project administration functions, such as advertising and pro-
cessing of plot applications, issuing of Rights-of-Occupancy, and
collection of ground rents and fees, are performed by the Regionala
Land Development Offices (RLDO). The RLDO also have responsibility for
advising and assisting in the formation of housing cooperatives and
will perform the essential function of coordinating the activity of
other regional offices dealing with matters such as education, health,
water supply, and electric power. RIDOs in the three regions included
in the project are adequatily staffed.
Training
37. Technically trained manpower, a constraint in most sectors in
Tansania, also presents a problem in the Government institixtionsi dealing
with this sector. Currently, Ardhi is relying heavily on expatriate
assistance provided by the UNDP and bilateral-aid agencies. Under the
project, it is proposed to assist in developing training facilities to
reduce dependence on external assistance. Funds w1 be provided for
the expansion of the physical facilities of the Ardhi Institute, located
at the University of Dar es Salaam. The Institute, which provides sub-
professional training in aLrveying, land management, valuation and town
planning, currently has only 26 trainees in town planning.  With funds
provided under the project, the Institute's facilities will be expanded
to accanmodate 60 town planning students.  In addition, Ardhi will be
responsible for an in-house, two-year training program for 12 civil/
sanitary technicians. Funds have been provided in the project for
consultants to carry out this training, as well as for training equipment
and materials.
Terms and Financial Conditions
38. The Government has agreed in Section 3.07 of the Development Credit
Agreezent to a set of criteria to select applicants for plots in the
project sites. These criteria should enable Ardhi to select families
with genuine housing needs and steady employment and income. It is
estimated that per plot charges for beneficiaries, excluding house con-
struction loans, will range fron TSh 12.7 per month in squatter upgrading
areas to TSh 37.8 per month for a new plot. These charges consist of a
statutory ground rent of about TSh 37.0 per year per plot, collected
by the Treasury, for the use of land, and 'chargeable ground rent," ranging
from TSh 9.6 per month for squatter areas to TSh 34.7 for a new plot,
which is designed to recover, over 25 years at 9 percent per annum, 75
percent oX the on-site cost of the infrastructure provided; the rmaini
25 percent relates to comimnity facilities. In addition, construction
loans made by THB are estimated to range between TSb 4,o00 and TSh 10,000,
with a typical loan of TSh 5,000 amortized at 6 peroont over 20 years.



- 14 -
It is thtefore estimated that the total Monthl p        t for w    it
covering all costs (plot charges and repayment of construction loan)
will range from TSh 50.8 to Tsh 88.6 per mnth. Households mat alo
meet the frot-end costs8, whichae an important expression of the
household's cmaitamnt to the project.    These coatB include a down
payment amounting to 10 percent of the assignable cost of the infrastructre
provided and several anall foos. On the as      tic  that families spend
15 percent ox? their income  n housing, the di       monthl4 household
incme required to afford a new plot ranges from TSh 340 to TSh 590 per
month. However, households with lower incomes, about TSh 200 per month,
will also be able to afford a plot, either by taking a smllor ccnsracUion
loan or through renting of rooms to others. In Dar es Salam, with 16
percent of households earaing less than TSh 200 per month and 14 percent
more than T S  750 per month, it is expected that the project Will reach
well down on the household income scale and cover an intermediary range
on the acale including about 70 percent of the total income distribution.
39. The Government will relend to THB, from the proceeds of the proposed
credit, $2.0 million (TSh 14 million) for construction loans. TIB will
repay this loan to the Government over 25 years, including 5 years grace,
at 3 percent per annum interest.  It is estimated that a total of TOi 45
million will be required to provide credit for all new censtruction and
improvements on the proposed projoet sites. Taking IDA funds and
contributions expected from bi-lateral sources (IDA) into account,
THB will need an additional TMh 16.8 million. The Goveronmnt has
agreed in Section 3.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement to provide
sufficient funds for the THB to meet the demand for low-oo t construction
loans in accordance with the project's construction schedule.
Procurement and Disburtsent
40. Contracts for civil works will be let after international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA procurement procedures. Because
of the scattered locationa and staggered time schedules, the civil works
will be divided into a number of small contracts, ranging between $300,000 --
$1.5 million. In order to interest small and apecialized contractors
and promote competition, it is proposed to combine the various works into
three or four groups and to tender each group separately. As the construc-
tion work will be labor intensive, involving simple equipmnat ad techniques,
it will be well within the capabilities of local contractors. In evaluating
bids, local civil works contractors will be allowed a 7-½ percent preference
over bids of foreign contractors. Due to the aise, nature and location of
the project it is unlikely that foreign firma based outside Dar es salaam
would be interested in bidding for construction works. However, there are
a number of established contractors in the Esnt African countries. In
accordanoe with Bank/IDA procedures, tenders till be advertised in the East



- 15 -
African countries, and embassies in Dar es Salaam will be notified.
Prequalification of contracting finrs will be required. Contracts for
equlpment an vehicles will be awarded in accordanc with the Governent's
umal procurement procedurs in view of the fact that only an estimated
US$150,000 would be involved in the purchase of these items which consist
mainly of six serrice vehicles and sundry equipment for the Cc3nity
Education Centers. In addition, theae items will be required at different
stages of project implementation and hence their procurement will also have
to be staggered. Local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15 percent or the existing rate of import duties, whichever
is less, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports.
41. A schedule of estimated disbursements is included in Annex III.
To begin project construction as soon as possible, the Government has
engaged consultants for the detailed engineering of the infrastructure.
The terms of reference of the consultants were agreed to by ID& and
work began in January 1974. It is recommended that retroactive finncing
up to an amount of $200,000 be included in the credit.
lecmomic Justification
42. The main Justification for the project is that it would help alle-
viate a severe shortage of low-cost housing in Dar as Salaam and the
two upcountry towns and put such housing within the financial reach of
the low-income urban dwellers. The sites and services and squatter
improvement approach would provide lower cost housing than previous
public housing programs. As there is a large element of self-help
construction, they would also serve as a model for a long-teon national
sites and services program. The technical assistance component would
strengthen the Government's inatitutional capacity to plan and implement
national sites and services programs.
43. In order to permit an easily quantifiable and conservative evaluation,
the benefits have been measured in terms of the estimated market values
for the dwelling units to be constructed. The economic life of the
project has been assumed at 25 years, which corresponds to the useful
physical life of the basic infrastructure and community facilities and
an improved Swahili house.On this basis, the internal economic rate of
return for the various sites ranges froa 10.4 to 14.5 percent, with the
higher rato for the squatter improvement sites.
Special Features of the Project
44. Some special features of the project ares provision of the l1
Coumnity Edacation Centers for the sites developed; the inclusion of
a pilot nutrition project; and the provision of fbuds for amnitoring
the projoct. Commmnty Education Centers in the rural areas have
been financed earlier under the Fourth Bducation Project (371-TA) and



- 16 -
the Geita Cotton Project (454--TA) to serve as primary schools and provide
basic facilities for instructing adults in crafts, agriculture, work-
oriented literacy, home science, health care and to generally complement
other rural development activities. In the proposed project these
objectives will also be served with an urban orientation. The
pilot nutrition project will be carried out by the Tanzanian Food and
Nutrition Center, which has been established with SIDA assistance. Its
purpose will be to encourage changes in food habits, based on nutritional
considerations and to develop capabilities to prepare and disseminate
appropriate nutritional information. Provision has also been made in
the project for undertaking sample surveys by the Economic Research
Bureau of the University of Dar es Salaam to monitor and assess whether
the project objectives are being met. This will provide a feedback of
information during the project's implementation, allowing for flexibility
in administration and enabling the collection of data for the preparation
of future sites and services projects in Tanzania.
PART V - L]EAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45. The draft Development CrediL Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and the Tanzania Housing Bank, the Report of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Eaecutive Directors separately.
46. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47. I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION!"
(As of March 31, 1974)
There are currently 11 projects under execution.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project: $9.0 Million Credit of October
9, 1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
Although this Project continues to experience difficulties, its
prospects appear to be improving. Farmer recruitment has improved
now that more farmers can cultivate tobacco on an individual as well
as a collective basis; however, there is still a shortfall of the
revised planting targets. The village water supply situation which
has caused severe recruitment problems in the past has greatly improved.
The financial managemant of the Project remains weak and arrangements
are being made to recruit a suitably qualified and experienced financial
controller for the Tobacco Authority.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 Million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
This Project has experienced a number of delays. Although problems
relating to farmer recruitment have eased as the Government's col-
lectivization policy has become more flexible, the Project has experienced
a number of implementation difficulties reflecting shortcomings in
Project management. The Government and the Tea Authority are now
considering ways of strengthening management to assist the
Authority in solving those difficulties.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are being encountered, and the actions
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Doevelopuent Project: $18.5 Million
Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 197°
The Credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973. The
Government is recruiting the necessary staff to implement this Project.
Plans for the first phase of procurement are presently being finalized.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 Million Credit of
January 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
This credit was declared effective on April 5, 1974. The Govern-
ment and Cotton Authority are proceeding with recruitment.
POVER SECTOR
Loan No. 715 TA - Kidatu Rydroelectric Project: $30.0 Million Loan
of December 1h, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
This Project has encountered major cost overruns. The latest
cost estimates exceed the original (US $59.0 million) by about one-
half. The two main factors responlsible for the overruns were (i)
the unexpectedly high cost escalations inside and outside Tanzania
since appraisal in April 1970 and (ii) the unexpected bad rock cond-
itions encountered during escalation of the underground facilities
which make up the major part of the main civil engineering works.
CIDA of Canada has provided Can$13.0 million to cover a large portion
of the overruns. Discussions are currently- taking place between the
Bank, the Government and SIDA with a view to covering the residual
(about $ 9 .5 million). A supplementary loan would be necessary to ensure
the completion of the Project as originally scheduled3 such a proposal id
shortly expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors for their
consideration. In spite ol' these cost overruns, Lhe Project still remains
the most attractive alternative to othar possible development including
thermal, in the power sector.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit No. 460-TA - Tanzania Investment Bank Project: $6.0 Million Credit
of Februaxy 13, 1974; Closing_Date - June 30, 1978
This Credit was declared effective on April 18, 1974.

TRANSPCRTATION SECTOR
Loan No. 586-TA - Second Highway Project: $7.0 Million Loan of
February 24, 1969; Original Closing Date - December 31, 1972:
Revised Closing Date - June 30, 1974
Construction work on this Project has been completed, but out-
standing claims by contractors are substantial. The Government and the
contractors have been negotiating these various claims for some time;
these negotiations are still continuing.
Credit No. 265-TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 Million Credit of
August 6, 1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1974
After long delays by Government in completing tender
arrangements, an award of contract for the improvement of the
Mtwara-Masasi Road has been made. However, owing to the increase
in world prices for civil works since the appraisal in 1970, the bid
price for improving this Road is now more than double the appraisal
estimate. Work by two betterment units on the improvement of about
475 km. of agricultural feeder roads in the Geita district and Mara
region has commenced. Consultants for the preinvestment studies
to be funded under the Project have been selected and contracts are
being negotiated.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149-TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 Million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Progress has improved recently. All civil works contracts
have now been awarded and although it is not expected that lost time
can be made up, all elements of the project should be completed in good
order within a 24 month extension of the Closing Date.
Credit No. 232-TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 Million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
BidB for the construction of all 13 project institutions
were received in May 1973 resulting in the contract award for four
institutions but due to high quotations and poor response, the
remaining nine were retendered. Although the new tenders were still
higher than anticipated, all civil works contracts have now been
awarded. Although the lost time cannot be made up, project progress
has now improved.

Credit No. 371-TA - Fourth Biucation Project: $10.3 Million Credit
of April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The Credit was declared effective July 2, 1973. The
Project Coordinator has been appointed and after some delays,
technical assistance specialists to assist in Project implementation,
provided by the Danish International Development Agency, have
been recruited and are now arriving in Dar es Salaam.
