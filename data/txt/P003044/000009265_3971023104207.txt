SEVENTH SOFIDE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Zaire
Beneficiary:              Socigt6 Financiare de Developpement (SOFIDE),
Centre de Perfectionnement aux Techniques de
Developpement (CEPETEDE) and Government
Amount:                   SDR 34.0 million equivalent to US$36.0 million
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms
Relending Terms:          The borrower would on-lend US$33.5 million to
SOFIDE at a minimum interest rate of 8.5 percent
per annum with a flexible amortization schedule
that would substantially conform with the
aggregate of the amortization schedules of
subloans made by SOFIDE and financed under this
proposed project, subject to a maximum of 15
years, including a grace period not to exceed 3
years; SOFIDE would relend the funds at a minimum
rate of 15.5 percent per annum to its sub-
borrowers, who will bear the foreign exchange
risk. The borrower would pass on US$0.25 million
to CEPETEDE as a grant. The remaining US$2.25
million would be used by the borrower.
Project Description:      The IDA Credit would finance the foreign exchange
component (US$33.5 million) of the capital
investment requirements of subprojects approved by
SOFIDE in the agriculture, transportation,
industrial and agro-industrial sectors. At least
US$5.0 million would be reserved for export
oriented projects and up to US$4.0 million could
be used to finance SOFIDE equity participations in
enterprises, provided that SOFIDE take measures
satisfactory to the Association to protect itself
against the foreign exchange risk. The remaining
US$2.5 million of the IDA credit would finance (a)
the cost of technical assistance and
implementation of studies to improve industrial
sector policy formulation and project selection
(US$2.25 million); and (b) training and other
assistance needed by CEPETEDE to help it improve
its effectiveness as a training institute in
project analysis. (US$0.25 million).



- 2 -
The main benefits of the project would be to
continue strengthening SOFIDE, help improve
formulation and implementation of industrial
policies, and preserve Zaire's productive capacity
during a difficult adjustment period. The main
risk relates to the impact on SOFIDE and its
clients of the recent macro-economic reforms,
which could, in the short-run, affect the quality
of SOFIDE's portfolio. This risk is, however,
limited (a) because many of SOFIDE's borrowers are
long established companies with good financial
resilience; and (b) because of the strong action
SOFIDE has already taken to improve its
supervision and loan collection efforts and the
comprehensive measures proposed in the context of
this project to limit portfolio deterioration and
which SOFIDE will implement in close consultation
with IDA.

THE MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SEFTORS
A. The Manufacturing Sector
The Setting
1.01      Zaire, the third largest country in Africa with an area of 2.3
million km2, has a population of about 30 million, of which approximately
one third live in urban centers. Agriculture is the most important sector
contributing 35% of GDP (Annex 1) and employing more than 75% of the active
population. Mining and mineral processing represent 16% of GDP, are the
largest source of public revenues and account for more than two thirds of
the country's export earnings. Public administration contributes 11% of
GDP, services 30% and construction about 5%. Manufacturing accounts for
about 3% of GDP.
1.02      From 1967 to 1974, GDP grew at a rate of 7% per year in real
terms, spurred by high copper and coffee prices, but decreased thereafter.
By 1981, GDP at constant prices was about 8% below its 1974 level. The
Zairianization (Government-sponsored takeover of most foreign owned
business, mainly by private Zairians) and Radicalization (nationalization
of most large enterprises in all the major sectors of the economy) measures
of 1973-75, coupled with the severe balance of payments crisis resulting
from a substantial decrease in copper prices and high debt service payments
were the primary reasons for this severe deterioration of the economic
situation. The demonetization measure in 1979 (when notes representing 73%
of currency in circulation were demonetized and replaced on a two for one
basis by new notes) further worsened the situation as many individuals and
companies were not able to exchange their notes within the specified time
period. Severe cash shortages and liquidity problems resulted and affected
much of the private sector. Faced with a deteriorating economic situation,
the Government sought to regulate economic activity. Prices of most
agricultural commodities and manufactured products were controlled and
mechanisms were established to allocate scarce foreign exchange.
1.03      A slight economic recovery was registered in 1980 and 1981 when,
aided by a recovery in copper production, there was a real GDP growth of
2.4% in each year. In 1981, the Government freed most agricultural prices
and declared that the directly productive sectors would be reserved mainly
for the private sector. These two years of moderate recovery, however,
were followed by a further contraction (about 1%) of real GDP in 1982 and
an increased shortage of foreign exchange due mainly to a fall in copper
prices. To address this situation, in September 1983, the Government
adopted a broad and comprehensive program of policy reforms in collabo-
ration with the IMF. The program included (i) a devaluation of the ZaIre
by about 400% to the then prevailing parallel market rate (i.e., from
US$1.00 - Z 5.8 to US$1.0 - Z 30); (ii) the introduction of a transitional



-2-
dual exchange rate regime consisting of an official rate and a free market
rate. These rates were unified at the end of February 1984. The exchange
rate is now determined by an inter bank foreign exchange market in which
all commerc ai banks and the central bank participate; (iii) liberalization
and simplification of other exchange and trade arrangements (paras. 1.17
and 1.18); (iv) a comorehensive revision of customs duties (para. 1.18);
(v) the freeing of virtually all commercial bank deposit and lending rates;
(vi) tax and expenditure measures aimed at reducing the budgetary deficit;
(vii) credit restraint policies; and (viii) an increase in the tariff of
public utilities. So far, these measures are working satisfactorily.
Foreign exchange is being traded freely between the banks and the parallel
market has all but disappeared. The rate of the Zaire depreciated slightly
(to about US$1.00 = Z34) by early March 1984. Moreover, foreign exchange
availability improved following the approval of a standby arrangement by
the IMF and a successful debt rescheduling, both of which took place in
December 1983.
Structure, Ownership end Location
1.04      The manufacturing sector (including agro-industry but excluding
mining, ore processing and construction) of Zaire is relatively small,
representing in 1981 about 3% of GDP and prrviding employment for some
121,000 persons, or 12% of total employed labor force. The level of
employment has stagnated since the early 1970s. The sector has been
decreasing steadily at a faster rate than the rest of the economy since
1974 when it represented 8.4% of GDP. However, it still accounts for about
14% of the total contribution to GDP of the mDdern directly productive
sectors. Medium and large enterprises (over 100 workers) account for
nearly 90% of total manufacturing value added and over 80% of employment.
The sector is dominated by agro-industrial firms, many of which are
vertically integrated and process the production of plantations. Principal
agro-industrial activities include palm oil processing, sugar refining,
coffee drying, beverages, cigarettes, flour milling, rubber and wood
processing. The textile and clothing industry also has important backward
linkages to agriculture since it is based on local cotton. Other
activities include petroleum refining, matches, paints, plastics, paper
based packaging as well as a whole range of metal working industries.
Annexes 2 and 3 give details of the evolution of the Index of the Volume of
Manufacturing Output and of the geographical distribution and employment in
the sector.
1.05      The statistical data base on the sector is weak.  Following an
industrial sector survey in 1970 no systematic review (or update) took
place until 1981 when INS (the National Institute of Statistics of the
Ministry of Planning) started a survey of industrial enterprises with
Canadian Government assistance. The preliminary results of this survey,
based on 1979 data, have recently become available. These indicate that
metal working was the most important subsector accounting for 20% of total
sector output by value. Textiles was second with 12%, followed by
petroleum refining (about 12%), flour milling (8%), beverages (7%),
breadmaking (about 7%), and cooking oil (6%).



-3-
1.06      As in many other countries at the same stage of development,
manufacturing activity is irward-oriented, consisting essentially of the
production of consumer goods for the domestic market. The mining sector
(copper, cobalt, tin, zinc, gold, diamonds) accounts for about 70% of total
exports, which, in 1982 amounted to about US$1.45 billion. Crude oil
exports accounted for another 18%. Agroindustrial and manufactured
products make up the remaining 12%. These consist mainly of coffee (US$105
million), palm and palm kernel oil (US$11 million), lumber, chinchona and
papaine. Over the past few years, Zaire started exporting cement (about
US$9 million in 1982). There is also a certain amount of unrecorded
exports of manufactured products through border trade.
1.07      Most of the agro-industrial and basic consumer good producing
firms, which constitute the main core of Zaire's manufacturing sector, were
established before independence. These firms in general depend on local
raw materials and are oriented towards satisfying the basic needs of the
population. Newer industries, set up mainly in the late sixties with
foreign interests, depend to a larger extent on imported inputs and in
general have a lower domestic value added than the first category.
1.08      Until 1973, almost all major industrial enterprises were owned by
foreign and locally based expatriate interests. The Zairianization and
radicalization measures in 1973-75 (para. 1.02) transferred to Zairian
hands ownership of about two thirds of firms in the manufacturing sector,
although they continued to be managed by expatriate owners and managers.
These measures, however, had damaging effects on production and in 1976 the
Government rescinded these measures and decided to return 60% of the equity
in Zairianized and radicalized enterprises to their former foreign owners.
The Zairianization and radicalization measures also led to a severe
deterioration in the distribution network and infrastructure (mainly roads
previously maintained by the large agroindustrial enterprises and which
linked the urban and rural areas) and severely undermined private sector
confidence. As a result, investment in the sector has been low. Equipment
in many enterprises has not been regularly renewed and although industrial
plants in many sectors have been reasonably well maintained, they are old
and need to be replaced.
1.09      Over the past 15 years, there has been no significant change in
the structure of the sector or the location of enterprises, except for a
heavier dependence on imported inputs due to the deterioration in
agricultural production and the consequent insufficient supply of local
inputs. Zaire's manufacturing industry is still closely linked with
commerce with many enterprises having substantial commercial operations.
Kinshasa remains the main center of industry (about 40% of production) with
Lubumbashi being the second most important manufacturing town (about 30% of
production).

Past Performance and Present Situation
1.10      Between 1970 and 1974, manufacturing output grew at an annual
average rate of 7% but declined thereafter until 1982 when oL put at
constant prices was about 11% below its 1970 level. Since 1970, the
performance of the various subsectors differed considerably with basic
consumer products (food, beverages, soaps) registering growth and other
sectors, such as leather goods, plastics, metal products and trausport
equipment declining sharply.
1.11      In recent years, Zaire's manufacturing industry has been
increasingly faced with: (a) a declining demand for most manufactured
products as a result of falling real wages and salaries. Although non
salary benefits have increased significantly (the base salary of industrial
workers accounts for less than 40% of total compensation), real wages have
declined constantly since 1975 such that, for example, by 1981 public
sector salaries in real terms were about 75 percent below their 1975
level 1/; (b) shortage of local and imported inputs due to the dislocation
of the transportation system, and the deterioration of agriculture and
forestry; (c) difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange for spare parts and
raw materials; and (d) the tight liquidity situation of many firms. These
factors had i serious impact on industrial capacity utilization (about 30%
of installed capacity), while persistently high inflation (averaging 45%
p.a. from 1979 to 1982) affected the financial situation of most
enterprises. Although enterprises were still able to generate a positive
cash flow because of the cost-plus price system (para. 1.13) and to show
some accounting profits, in the absence of asset revaluation (para.
1.25 (a)) the profits were not sufficient in most enterprises to generate
the resources needed to replace equipment or to remunerate equity. This
seriously diminished the incentive to make new investments in the sector.

Industrial Policies
1.12      Institutional Set Up and Current Government Strategy.  The two
most important ministries affecting industrial policies in Zaire are those
of Planning (which administers the Investment Code) and of Finance which
sets and collects tariffs and taxes. The Ministry of Industry and National
Economy has the task of promoting industrial development but is mainly
involved in price regulation (para. 1.13). Government strategy towards the
sector is based on (i) recognizing that the directly productive sectors
(except for the strategic sectors e.g. mining) are the domain of the
private sector and that the role of Government in these sectors is to
provide basic infrastructure; (ii) broadening the dialogue on matters of
economic policy to include the private sector (mainly through ANEZA, the
private sector enterprises association); (iii) providing the right price
incentives and market signals; (iv) encouraging rehabilitation/recons-
truction of existing industrial plants as the main priority in the short-
to medium-term; and (v) strengthening the country's investment planning
capacity in manufacturing. In the present situation of Zaire, this
strategy is justified. At the request of Government, the Bank Group has
already provided assistance through the technlcal assistance/studies
component of the sixth IDA Credit for SOFIDE to finance the services of two
experts to help formulate the policies necessary to ensure the success of
this strategy. The proposed project would continue and expand this support
through its technical assistance component, and by serving as a vehicle for
an increasing dialogue on industrial policy (para. 3.09).
Price System
1.13      Until 1981, prices of most manufactured goods were set at the
producer, wholesale and retail levels by the Ministry of Industry and
National Economy. Producer prices were generally established on the basis
of production costs (including depreciation) plus a 20 percent profit
margin before tax. The main objective of this policy was to control
inflation. This price control system, however, was not effective and led
to distortions. In the shortage-dominated market of 1979-1981, the
controls led to speculation in retail prices (far more difficult to control
than producer prices) and encouraged inefficiency since companies could
generate a positive cash flow irrespective of capacity utilization. Since
1981, Government moved to decontrol prices. These are now freely set by
enterprises which need only communicate them to the Ministry of Industry
and National Economy within 30 days.
Trade Policies
1.14      The Exchange and Import Regimes.  Between 1975 and 1980, the
import regime was characterized by strict foreign exchange controls,
allocation procedures, and tight import controls imposed by BDZ (the
central bank). Commercial banks, which until 1974 administered almost all
foreign exchange transactions (with the exception of copper, cobalt and
diamond exports), were required to let the producer-exporters retain 15% of



-6-
their export proceeds and to surrender to BDZ 30% of the remaining foreign
exchange earned by the producer-exporters. They were further instructed to
allocate their foreign exchange receipts as follows: 30% for imports of
consumer gG-ds; 45% for raw materials, spare parts and intermediate goods;
and 25% for payments of invisibles. Despite these measures and several
devaluations by a total of almost 500% between 1975 and February 1980 (from
US$1 = Z 0.5 to US$1 = Z 2.9), the Zaire remained overvalued and foreign
exchange became more scarce, resulting in shortages of many imported
consumer and intermediate goods.
1.15      Starting in mid-1980, in an effort to improve the supply of
imported goods, the Government started to relax import and foreign exchange
controls. Prior import authorization requirements were lifted for mDst
goods and importers were no longer required to disclose the source of
foreign exchange for their imports. They were thus de facto allowed to
purchase foreign exchange from the parallel market which had developed
rapidly since the mid-1970s in response to the overvaluation of the Zaire.
This measure, coupled with the creation in November 1981, of a new legal
source of foreign exchange which was sold at rates similar to the parallel
market rate, 2/ enabled many manufacturing enterprises to import essential
spare parts and raw materials without delay. However, the Zaire remained
overvalued despite another devaluation to US$1.0 = Z 5.8 in June 1981 and,
by mid-1983, the parallel market rate stood at about 5 times the official
rate.
1.16      In the import regime prevailing up to September 1983, import
tariffs consisted of four cumulative taxes and duties (customs duty ranging
from 0-22%, import tax 0-40%, supplementary import duty 5-20%, and
statistical tax of 5%). However, the actual level of tariff protection was
low since these four taxes and duties were calculated on imports valued at
the official exchange rate (i.e. at only a fraction of their real cost).
The main limitation to imports continued to be the shortage of foreign
exchange.
1.17      The reforms of September 1983 changed both the exchange and
import systems. The Zaire was devalued to the level of the then parallel
market rate (US$1.0 = Z 30) and an interbank foreign exchange market was
established (para. 1.03) to determine the parity of the Zaire. The
parallel foreign exchange market and its sources were abolished since
foreign exchange can now be purchased through the banking system. No prior
import authorization is needed for any item, except those on a restricted
list of dangerous products (e.g. radioactive materials, explosives, etc.).
2/ In November 1981, Government authorized SOZACOM (the State Company
responsible for marketing mining products) to sell its foreign exchange
earnings from export of artisanal diamonds at a negotiated rate which
tended to approach the parallel exchange rate. These funds (known as
the Mining Recovery Funds) could be purchased legally from commercial
banks without going through intermediaries.



-7-
The import of some other products is banned on public policy grounds (e.g.
certain alcoholic beverages, material contrary to public morals etc.).
1.18      The tariff structure was also simplified and changed.  The number
of taxes were reduced to two (customs duty and a turnover tax on imports)
and the rates on raw materials and intermediate goods were lowered to about
3-10%, so that the effective duty payable now is about the same as before
the devaluation. At the same time, the duties on finished goods were
increased, particularly those on luxury products, which now carry rates of
up to 200%. The main purpose behind the change was to encourage
manufacturing activity in Zaire and to ensure, at the same time, that
Government revenues did not fall. With the new tariff structure, some
industries with low local value added (e.g. car assembly) could now be
sheltered by very high effective protection. This could, in time,
encourage activities with poor economic justification. To address this
issue, Government needs to carry out a detailed evaluation of the present
tariff structure, with a view to revising it to ensure that only industries
with actual or potential comparative advantage are encouraged. Such a
review would aim at (i) reducing the overall level of effective
protection; and (ii) establishing a more neutral incentive system for all
enterprises. The review would have to take into account the fiscal
implications of any recommendation. At negotiations of the proposed
credit, agreement was reached with Government that it will (i) carry out
and complete by December 1985 such a review which would cover the structure
of tariff, the system of import licensing, export incentives and
disincentives, and the structure of effective protection; and (ii) discuss
with IDA the results as well as a program to implement the study's agreed
recommendations. This review (to be carried out in the Ministry of
Planning in consultation with the Ministry of Finance) would be financed
out of the Studies/Technical Assistance component of the proposed credit.
Terms of reference have been prepared and agreed with Government during
negotiations. Some tariff readjustments, however, could possibly be
introduced while the study is still being carried out. Bank staff and
Government officials will explore this possibility as the study progresses
and its preliminary findings are known.
1.19      Export Regulations and Promotion.  Exports require a licence
which can be obtained through a commercial bank. Some exports, notably
rubber and palm oil, require an authorization from the Ministry of Economy
to ensure that there are sufficient supplies for the local market. In
general, the system of licensing functions smoothly. Most traditional
exports are also subject to an export duty (4%), in addition to the normal
turnover tax (6.75% to 7.75%) and statistical tax (1%). On timber and
coffee the total rates are higher (12.75% to 17.75%). However, other
agricultural goods, cement, clothing, textile fibres, and a number of other
manufactured products are exempt from the payment of the export duty.
Cement and some other commodities are also exempt from the payment of the
turnover tax.



-8-
1.20      The main problems faced by industry in Zaire for the past ten
years (dislocation of general economic activity, poor investment climate,
inadequate supply of agricultural raw materials) contributed to the poor
performance of manufactured exports. Export taxes did not pose real
obstacles to the development of exports of manufactured goods, particularly
since wherever potential problems presented themselves (cement), exemptions
were rapidly granted. However, in order to improve the incentives for
exports and to signal the need for a more outward-oriented policy, OFIDA
(the Customs and Excise Office) is now considering the abolishment of
export taxes on non-primary goods. In addition, the Bank Group will
support a review of the incentives and disincentives to exports in the
context of the overall review of Zaire's trade regime (para. 1.18).
1.21      Zaire also allows temporary admission of imports for exports.
Because of the foreign exchange shortages in recent years, a small number
of enterprises, (mainly in textiles), entered into subcontracting
arrangements with foreign textile producers whereby the latter furnished
the Zairian firms with cotton for transformation into grey cloth against
payment in cotton (usually for every 100 units of cotton imported, the
Zairian company processed two thirds for the foreign firm and retained one
third for sale on the domestic market). These barter-type arrangements are
limited and of recent origin, and there is little official data on the
amount of this trade.
Investment Code
1.22      The present investment code enables Government to grant to
eligible investors exemptions from customs duties and import taxes, and
partial or total exemption from income taxes for a period not exceeding
f've years, which, however, can be extended. The Code is administered by
an Investment Commission located within the Planning Ministry. SOFIDE (the
development bank of Zaire) prepared and financed most projects which
benefitted from the Code in recent years. In 1982, the Investment
Commission approved 33 projects involving total investment of about US$85
million. The Code itself is satisfactory. Its main drawback as an
investment incentive has been the relatively slow speed with which the
commission has reviewed applications. Recently, however, a more dynamic
head of the Commission was appointed and the support staff of the
commission strengthened. This should enable the commission to speed up its
review process.
Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises
1.23      In 1973, Government set up OPEZ (Office for the Promotion of
Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) with UNDP assistance to help promote
small scale enterprises (SSE) development in Zaire. OPEZ was to provide
training and technical assistance to small entrepreneurs in project
preparation and implementation. However, the difficult economic situation
and lack of sufficient budgetary resources have handicapped OPEZ's
effectiveness. SOFIDE had started financing SSEs in the late 1970s as part



of its developmental effort and because it had been able to mobilize
substantial resources from foreign lenders for the purpose. Government,
over the past three years, has become increasingly aware of the need to
promote small-scale Zairian owned industries. In 1982, it set up a task
force, made up of representatives of various Government ministries, SOFIDE,
and ANEZA. The report produced by this task force recommended inter alia
that OPEZ be revitalized and that a credit guarantee fund for SSEs be
established. Recently, such a fund was created and its administration
entrusted to OPEZ. ANEZA is also drawing up, with external assistance, a
comprehensive list of SSEs operating in Zaire, which is expected to be
available by late 1984.
1.24      IDA's role will be to help Government formulate an action program
for promoting SSEs. One of the studies to be carried out under the
technical assistance component of the proposed project would explore ways
to strengthen OPEZ and establish appropriate financial assistance channels
and mechanisms for SSEs (para. 2.33). -
Fiscal Policies
1.25      There are several aspects of the present fiscal regime which
affect the incentive to invest in the industrial rector and the overall
structure of the sector. These are:
(a)  The Treatment of Asset Revaluation for Tax Purposes.
In the light of the high levels of inflationi in Zaire
in recent years, the depreciation allowed by the tax
code, which is based on historical costs, does not
provide sufficient funds for asset replacement and
overstates profit subject to tax. Particularly for
manufacturing and mining firms, which in general have a
much higher asset-to-revenue ratio than commercial or
service firms, the small depreciation allowances for
tax purposes constitute a deterrent to investment and
have adversely affected the financial situation of
enterprises. A law introduced in early 1983 allowing
companies to revalue assets is not adequate. It only
provides for a one time revaluation to take into
account the movement of the official parity of the
Zaire up to June 1981; it has a 10 percent tax payable
on the extent of the revaluation (which few firms can
pay) and is optional. A revision of the provisions of
this law, in such a way as to allow efficient companies
to build up the necessary reserves to replace
equipment, is needed. A study on the issue has already
been completed for Gecamines (the State mining company)
and the Zairian authorities agreed to carry out a
similar study for the manufacturing sector. The study
would be financed out of the studies/technical
assistance component of the ongoing sixth IDA credit



- 10 -
for SOFIDE. At negotiations of the seventh credit
recommended in this report, the terms of reference,
prepared by the Planning Ministry, as well as
a. rangements for the execution of this study, were
discussed and agreed with IDA. The results of the
study as well as a program for the implementation of
the study's agreed recommendations would be discussed
with IDA. The study should be completed in the first
quarter of 1985 and recommendations implemented by
mid-1985.
(b)  The Indirect Tax System and its Impact on Industrial
Structure. Besides corporate income tax (50 percent of
profit), firms pay a sales tax with the effective rate
on local production being 13.5 percent. In addition,
firms are subject to a number of other indirect taxes,
the most important of which is the tax to support the
Economic Development Fund (Fonds de Convention de
Developpement) 3/. These indirect taxes are
cumulative and amount to about 10% to 25% of total
revenue, even for basic goods industries. This system
of indirect taxation could have negative effects on
industrial efficiency since (i) it discourages
inter-industry exchanges; and (ii) is uneven with
enterprises paying different rates. Consideration
should be given to simplifying the regime and making
the system more neutral. An analysis of the various
aspects of indirect taxation from the economic
viewpoint would help identify recommendations for
changes in the system. A start in this direction has
already been made. Government has agreed to review in
detail the workings of the tax which finances the
Economic Development Fund. The review to be financed
by the on-going IDA-financed Kwango Kwilu project (Cr.
1152-ZR, approved in FY82) would be carried out by a
Committee composed of representatives of the Planning,
National Economy, Agriculture and Finance Ministries,
with the assistance of external consultants. Terms of
reference have been drawn up with IDA's assistance and
these, as well as arrangements for follow up, were
discussed and agreed with IDA at negotiations of the
proposed Credit. It was further agreed that the study
would be completed by June 30, 1985 and that the
3/ A tax of up to 10 percent of the total revenue of manufacturing
enterprises. Its proceeds are relent by Government, either directly ox
through the recently established Agricultural Development Bank and
SOFIDE, for investments in agricultural production.



- 11 -
study's results as well as a program to implement the
study's agreed recommendations would be discussed with
IDA.
General Issues
1.26      Other long term constraints hindering the development of the
manufacturing sector include (i) the small number of trained technical and
managerial staff in both Government and private firms, necessitating
reliance on expensive expatriate staff in many sectors; and (ii) generally
low labor efficiency mainly due to poor training and, despite low salaries,
high effective cost of labor due to the substantial benefits enterprises
are required to give. These two issues necessitate policies to eneourage
training of Zairian staff. Despite efforts by Government and SOFIDE (which
requires projects financed to include training programs to develop Zairian
staff capabilities at all levels) progress has been slow and more needs to
be done. By providing technical assistance and financing some equipment
for CEPETEDE under the proposed project (para. 3.14), IDA will help provide
more and better trained professional staff in Government, SOFIDE, and the
private sector.
1.27      Another issue relates to the Government's institutional weakness
in formulating appropriate sector policies and to the generally weak data
base. A start has been made to address this issue under the ongoing sixth
IDA credit for SOFIDE which provided funds for technical assistance and
policy studies to the Planning Ministry (para. 2.03). The project
recommended in this report proposes to continue this assistance and
includes a Studies/Technical Assistance component to the Ministries of
Planning, Finance and National Economy in the amount of US$2.25 million to
help (i) strengthen the Government's capability to formulate sector
policies; (ii) improve the statistical base by financing equipment and
technical assistance for INS; and (iii) carry out subsector reviews.
Annex 24 lists a number of studies which, at negotiations, the Government
proposed to finance out of this component (para. 3.09). Terms of reference
have been prepared and agreed with IDA for two cf these activities: (i) the
review of trade policies (para. 1.18); and (ii) the technical assistance to
allow INS to improve statistical information on industry.
B. The Financial Sector
1.28    The financial sector in Zaire consists mainly of the Banque du
Zaire (BDZ), which is the country's central bank, nine commercial banks,
and one development bank (SOFIDE). In 1983, Government established an
Agricultural Credit Bank which just started operation. There is also a
social security Fund (INSS - Institut National de Securite Sociale) and a
National insurance company (SONAS - Societe Nationale d'Assurance).
Savings and credit cooperatives are not important. The Central Bank is
responsible for regulating all the financial institutions in the country



- 12 -
and for establishing and administering national monetary and credit
policies. The BDZ also manages the country's international reserves.
1.29      Of the nine commercial banks, seven have 50% or mor-
participation by a foreign bank. Three of the banks have minority state
participation. Deposits are concentrated in the three largest banks
(Banque Commerciale Zairoise, Banque du Peuple, and Union Zairoise de
Banque), which together account for about 75% of total deposits. All the
banks have headquarters in Kinshasa. The total number of commercial bank
offices is about 100 spread in some 30 localities, mainly in the Kinshasa
area and in the Shaba province. Two cities, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi,
account for about 80% of all deposits. About 80% of deposits are of six
months maturity or less. The most important depositors are corporations
and state entities. The commercial banks play a particularly important
role in the financing of imports and exports in which they act under
regulation of the central bank. So far, they have not been active in term
lending because of the structure of their resources and the risks
involved. Furthermore, they lack the capacity to appraise investment
projects.  Lending by commercial banks is essentially short-term, but they
have also contributed to financing some industrial investment (in
conjunction with SOFIDE) through revolving short-term loans. The main
source of long term finance and the only non-government source of term
foreign exchange resources is SOFIDE, which has contributed substantially
to the setting up and, more recently, to the maintainance and
rehabilitation of industrial plants. Given Zaire's difficult economic
situation since -he early 1970s, private capital inflows have been
negligible. Accumulated depreciation, a traditionally important source of
industrial capital formation, is also negligible in Zaire because it is
based on historical costs and does not provide sufficient funds for asset
replacement (para. 1.25(a)). SOFIDE is described in detail in tl.e next
chapter of this report.
Credit Controls and Interest Rates
1.30      In an effort to control inflation (which since 1974 has averaged
about 45% per annum), BDZ has progressively tightened credit to both the
private and public sector over the past few years. The most important
instruments used by BDZ are global and selective ceilings on most short-
term credits that are set for the whole banking system, and for each of the
nine commercial banks 4/. The credit ceilings are set on a quarterly
4/ Credit subject to ceilings represents about two-thirds of the aggregate
credit program established by the Bank of Zaire. Credit outside the
ceilings is for (i) financing of foodstuffs (mainly purchases from
producers); (ii) cotton production; (iii) GECAMINES; and (iv) medium-
and long-term productive investment, which is granted only after prior
approval, on a case-by-case basis, by BDZ.



- 13 -
basis and the allocations per bank depend on their deposits and capital
resources. For each bank the global ceiling is divided into (i) freely
usable and (ii) regulated. The latter normally makes up about 90% of
credit subject to ceilings and is divided into five categories:
agriculture, industry and other productive sectors, transportation,
distribution and other services. These sectoral credit allocations are
justified by BDZ by the need to ensure that, in this period of tight
credit, priority sectors also receive sufficient bank resources.
Agriculture receives the highest allocation. To control credit expansion,
BDZ also imposes a minimum reserve requirement, which since 1979 has been
fixed at 25% of the demand deposits for each commercial bank.
1.31      Although commercial banks have been traditionally free to set
their own commissions, in the past, BDZ regulated interest rates on both
deposits and loans. Since April 1981, however, BDZ allowed commercial
banks to set some lending rates freely. More recently, in September 1983
BDZ freed all remaining lending rates with the exception of those on loans
for non-coffee agriculture, which were increased from 11% (short-term) and
13% (medium-term) to 15%. In maintaining this still favorable rate for
non-coffee agriculture, the Government seeks to foster the development of
this key sector of the economy. Rates paid by commercial banks on time
deposits of 3-24 months were set at a minimtum of 8-30% per annum, and those
on deposits of over 24 months were left freely negotiable.
1.32      The freeing of virtually all lending and deposit rate. should, in
the long-term, help improve deposit mobilization and encourage commercial
banks to diversify into activities other than trade and import-export
financing. At present, lending rates are still negative in real terms,
ranging from 25% to 35% (including commissions and other charges), while
inflation is expected to be around 30% to 45% in 1984-85. This situation,
however, is expected to change as the banks move towards now allowable
higher interest rates and as inflation levels off.
Bank Group Strategy
1.33      In the present difficult economic situation in Zaire, the
strategy of the Bank Group in the manufacturing and financial sectors is to
(i) extend the ongoing dialogue on macro economic policies to include
sector policy issues and specific actions needed for the sound development
of the industrial sector. Because of the limited technical capacity of
Government and the limited information base on the industrial sector, an
essential element of this strategy would be to help Government build up it.
capacity in these areas; (ii) support SOFIDE to maintain its effectiveness
in a difficult period of adjustment and help it adopt an improved operating
strategy; and (iii) provide foreign exchange resources for investment
needed to help the rehabilitation of Zaire's existing industrial base and
to stimulate manufactured exports.

II. THE INSTITUTION
A. Relationship with IDA and Performance under Bank Group Projects
2.01      The Socigt6 Financiare de Developpement (SOFIDE) was established
in 1970 with strong Bank Group support. IFC was one of the original
shareholders with an equity investment of US$750,000, representing '8% of
the initial share capital of US$4.0 million. IDA acted as the executing
agency for a program of technical assistance from UNDP and seconded a staff
member as Director General. In 1970, IDA also provided the first of six
credits, which to date amount to a total of US$75.0 million.
2.02      The main objectives of IDA's support to SOFIDE have been to
develop a strong independent development finance institution and to provide
investment resources for the productive sectors in Zaire, including
manufacturing, transport, agroindustry and commercial agriculture. Despite
the difficult economic conditions prevailing since the mid-1970s, SOFIDE
has emerged as a respected and effective term lending institution, staffed
by Zairians, and which is now the only source of term lending in foreign
exchange to the productive sectors. IDA's continued support has been
critical to this achievement. In the context of the fifth credit (Cr. 998
of FY80), for example, IDA assisted SOFIDE to draw up and adopt a new
investment strategy in order to establish a priority ranking of projects
submitted for financing to SOFIDE according to their importance to the
Zaire economy. Recently, in consultation with IDA, SOFIDE reviewed this
investment strategy to better tailor it to the present situation in Zaire
(para. 2.43 and Annex 6).
2.03      The Sixth SOFIDE Credit widened IDA's objectives in Zaire to
include the improvement of industrial policy formulation capabilities and
project selection at the national level. In mid 1983, following a
Government request, an industrial policy advisor, financed under the
studies/technical assistance component of the Sixth Credit was recruited
with IDA assistance and took up his post in the Industry Department of the
Planning Ministry in December 1983. His task is to help improve the
project selection criteria used by the Ministry's Investment Code
Commission, and to advise on specific industrial policy matters. A second
expert, an industrial economist, also financed under the sixth SOFIDE
credit, has been recently recruited to assist in reviewing projects for
financing under the Economic Development Fund. The terms of reference for
both experts were discussed and agreed with IDA. As of December 31, 1983,
about SDR 12.2 million (69% of the amount available under the investment
component of the sixth SOFIDE credit) have been commitled. Projects
financed included rehabilitation of coffee and palm oil plantations, a new
forestry project, a livestock rehabilitation project, conversion of a large
oil mill from fuel to electric boilers, rehabilitation of a cement plant,
manufacture of electric transformers, partial renewal of equipment for a
large civil engineering firm, modernization of a printing company and a
small sa,wmill, transport projects, and rehabilitation of small mining



- 15 -
companies. All but two of these projects were for equipment/plant renewal
and rehabilitation of enterprises. They all had financial and economic
rates of return in excess of 20%. Individual project size varied from SDR
6,500 to SDR1.9 million, with an average of SDR 367,000 (Annex 25).
Lessons from Audit
2.04      Two Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) covering the first
three Credits to SOFIDE were prepared by OED in 1976 and in 1982. The
first PPAR concluded that SOFIDE had rapidly succeeded in building up a
competent organization and in maintaining its independence in a difficult
environment, but pointed out that there was scope for improved performance,
particularly in appraisal and economic analysis of projects. The second
Project Performance Audit Report, covering the second and third SOFIDE
credits (271-CK and 463-CK, approved in FY71 and FY73, respectively)
commented positively on the institution building achievements of both
projects, but noted zgain the negative effects of the environment,
particuilarly of inflation, on SOFIDE's profitability. It also concurred
with staff appraisal that SOFIDE needed to further strengthen supervision
efforts and improve its organizational structure and accounting system to
enable it to cope with the increasing volume and diversity of operations.
SOFIDE moved rapidly to address these issues by increasing supervision and
instituting better cost controls, by reorganizing its structure along the
lines suggested in the PPAR (para. 2.16), and by raising interest rates.
In connection with the sixth credit, SOFIDE further addressed these issues
by improving arrears collection and its supervision and accounting
procedures (paras. 2.20, 2.22 and 2.23). Progress made to date is
satisfactory. The proposed SOFIDE VII Credit aims to assist SOFIDE further
in these areas (para. 2.36).
B. Institutional Aspects
Objectives and Role
2.05      SOFIDE's broad objectives aq stated in its statutes and Policy
Statement are to (i) provide equity and term loan finance for investments
in the productive sectors of the economy; and (ii) foster the development
of a capital market in Zaire. Because of the crises which have affected
the Zairian economy since 1973, SOFIDE could not pursue the second
objective and has concentrated its efforts on meeting the first. It has,
therefore, operated as a traditional development finance company providing
term finance mainly to industrial firms and, since 1980, to enterprises in
the commercial agriculture and agro-industry sectars. It has also
increased its financing to small enterprises. SOFIDE has established
itself as the major term lending institution in Zaire and has succeeded in
attracting and retaining the confidence of foreign lenders. The World Bank
Group's close and constant support through both financial and technical
assistance helped in this effort.

Share Capital and Ownership
2.06      SOFIDE's authorized share capital as of December 31, 1983, stood
at Z 12 million (US$0.4 million), all of which was paid in. The share
capital is held as follows:
Ownership in Percentage
Zairian Shareholders
Government                                                     40. 
Private Zairian Shareholders                                   35.0
Foreign Shareholders
IFC                                                             4.7
EIB and DEG                                                    10.0
Other Foreign (Private and Public)                             10.3
Total                                                   100.0
A full list of shareholders is attached as Annex 7. In addition to its
share capital (US$0.4 million) and reserves of US$0.5 million, SOFIDE has
US$0.2 million in long term, low interest, subordinated loans from
Government which have quasi-equity characteristics. Government has also,
with IDA's approval, extended the amortization schedule on the funds it had
relent to SOFIDE under the first five IDA credits to 50 years, including
20 years grace, and has agreed to subordinate these loans to all the other
debt liabilities of SOFIDE. Moreover, Government has agreed to bear the
full foreign exchange risk on these loans after the time of repayment of
the IDA financed subloans, on which beneficiaries bear the foreign exchange
risk, to SOFIDE. The maximum interest rate payable by SOFIDE on these
loans is 8.25% p.a. These loans can be regarded as quasi-equity, given
their long maturity and the relatively low interest rate SOFIDE pays on
them. As of December 31, 1983, these loans amounted to Z 376.6 million
(about US$12.5 million).
2.07      Following the September 1983 devaluation, the US $ value of
SOFIDE's capital fell from US$2.3 million to US$0.4 million. At the same
time, most of SOFIDE's loan portfolio and liabilities, which was already
denominated in foreign exchange, remained unchanged. This brought about a
deterioration in SOFIDE's debt-equity ratio and reduced the maximum loan
size to be financed by SOFIDE. To restore SOFIDE's financial base, in
March 1984 SOFIDE's Board approved a plan for a general capital increase
to Z 260 million (US$8.7 million). This plan calls for the issue of Z 165
million of new shares with the remaining Z 83 million coming from the
revaluation of assets and incorporation of reserves. The proposed capital



- 17 -
increase will have the effect of increasing SOFIDE's exposure limit per
client (set at 20% of equity and quasi-equity) from the present limit of
about US$2.7 million to about US$3.7 million. This would allow SOFIDE to
better meet the needs of the larger industrial firms in Zaire.
2.08      SOFIDE's major shareholders (including Government, DEG, CCCE and
the local banks) have indicated that they will support and participate at
least on a pro-rata basis in the capital increase. IFC is also considering
participating and, possibly, increasing its share in SOFIDE's capital to
10.0%. Government's share would be financed through incorporation of part
of the present quasi-equity into share capital. The German Government has
already signed an agreement in principle for DM 2 million (about Z 24
million) to finance the DEG participation. An extraordinary meeting of
SOFIDE's shareholders took place on April 19, 1984 and decided on the
following timetable for the subscription of the new shares: April 19, 1984
to July 19, 1984, with the first 45 days reserved exclusively for the
existing shareholders. To restore a more balanced relationship between net
worth and long term indebtedness, at least Z 100 million of the proposed
increase would have to be paid-in before credit effectiveness.
Board of Directors
2.09      SOFIDE's Board consists of 10 members (5 representing foreign
institutions and 5 the Zairian public and private shareholders) and is
chaired by SOFIDE's President and General Manager. The Board meets on a
quarterly basis to discuss major policy issues and to approve loans
exceeding US$300,000. SOFIDE's board acts in a sound and business-like
manner. Most directors, including those representing foreign shareholders
attend board meetings regularly.
Executive Committee
2.10      The Executive Commmittee, which is comprised of six members,
including SOFIDE's President and five locally-based Directors, usually
meets about once a month. It has authority to approve all operations below
board limits (para 2.09).
Management, Staffing and Organization
2.11      Management.  SOFIDE's President and General Manager is a Zairian
national who joined the institution in 1973. He is competent and well-
respected by Government and the business community in Zaire. The position
of Deputy General Manager has been held by various Bank staff on secondment
until 1981 when it was filled by a high level expatriate manager whose
contract was recently extended to 1985. SOFIDE's top management has
performed well in a difficult environment. In this it has been supported
by its middle management consisting of seven Department Directors who are
all Zairian and have been with SOFIDE for several years, some since its



- 18 -
inception. They are all competent and highly motivated and constitute the
backbone of the institution.
2.12      S-iffing and Training.  As of September 30, 1983, SOFIDE had a
total professional staff (excluding top management, i.e., the President and
the Deputy General Manager) of 58, including two expatriates (an accountant
financed by the Belgian cooperation and an internal auditor/organization
expert). All the staff are based in Kinshasa, except for nine who staff
the regional offices (para. 2.17). The staff typically have formal
training in business administration, economics, engineering or agronomy and
joined SOFIDE either directly from university following competitive
examination, or after 3-4 years working experience in the public or private
sector. Most professional staff have benefitted from specialized courses
in project finance and management, both in Zaire and abroad, and all of
them have had significant on-the-job training.
2.13      SOFIDE's staff is, by and large, competent and hardworking but
somewhat overstretched. In order to contain administrative costs (para.
2.39), SOFIDE has over the last 3-4 years kept the increase in staff
below the growth of operations. This policy is likely to be continued.
However, given the difficult situation facing most enterprises in Zaire
(paras. 2.34 - 2.36) and the need to increase supervision work, recently
SOFIDE recruited a new professional and transferred another to its
Supervision Department.
2.14      Staff Training Center (CEPETEDE).  In 1981, SOFIDE established,
in association with Government and the Central Bank, a training center in
banking, administration and financial and economic analysis of projects.
This was set up with financial and technical assistance from CCCE (Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique) and FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation) as an independent institution under the name CEPETEDE (Centre
de Perfectionnement aux Techniques de Developpement). Its objectives are
to train professional staff from both the public and private sector.
CEPETEDE's resources are provided mainly by fees paid by institutions
sponsoring candidates. It is managed by the former director of SOFIDE's
Studies Department. He is assisted by an expatriate Director of Studies
and two other expatriates. All three expatriates are financed by FAC.
CEPETEDE also has two full-time Zairian counterpart staff and, from time to
time, recruits on a part-time basis professional staff from local
institutions and enterprises to give seminars in their respective field of
expertise.
2.15      CEPETEDE has performed well and has enabled SOFIDE, Government
institutions, and private enterprises to offer their staff a more
comprehensive training program than they could provide with their own
facilities and resources. Since 1981, about 70 professionals have taken
CEPETEDE's four-month basic course and the three-month specialization in
project evaluation or management of enterprises. CEPETEDE has also
organized five seminars on various subjects, including inventory
management, national accounts, financial analysis, management of
enterprises, and role of the development bank. This last seminar was



- 19 -
organized for and financed by the Union Africaine et Mauricienne des
Banques de Developpement. EDI is presently considering using CEPETEDE's
facilities for its training seminars in Africa. The sixth IDA credit
for SOFIDE included US$150,000 within its technical assistance component to
enable CEPETEDE to engage the services of foreign experts to run high level
seminars such as those described above. To date about 50% of these funds
have been utilized and it is anticipated that CEPETEDE will exhaust the
balance before the end of 1984. Given CEPETEDE's success and continued
needs, and its importance to SOFIDE in helping train its staff, the
proposed project would continue to support CEPETEDE (paras. 3.03(c), 3.14
and 3.15).
2.16      Organization.  In early 1981, following detection of
deficiencies in a number of areas (e.g. project appraisal, accounting,
supervision, etc.) SOFIDE, with IDA and CCCE assistance, carried out an
extensive restructuring of its organization which was cumbersome and
resulted in substantial duplication of effort. Since then, the structure
has not changed (Annex 8). It consists of seven departments, each headed
by a director reporting to top management (President/General Manager and
Deputy General Manager). The seven departments are: Finance (financial
management and accounting); Projects (promotion and appraisal of
non-agricultural projects); Agriculture (promotion and appraisal of
agricultural projects); Supervision/Technical (project supervision and
technical review of projects); Administration (personnel and general
administration); Studies (economic research); and the Department
responsible for coordinating the four regional offices (para. 2.17). This
structure and the clear division of responsibilities between the various
operational departments have resulted in considerable improvement in
appraisal procedures, project supervision, as well as in financial
management and accounting (paras. 2.19, 2.20 and 2.22).
2.17      Regional Offices.  Besides its headquarters in Kinshasa, SOFIDE
has four regional offices located in Goma, Lubumbashi, Kisangani and
Kananga. The first three were established in 1978/79. The Kananga office
was opened in 1983. The main functions of the offices are promotional and
supervision of projects in their respective region. They also help collect
data for appraisal of projects but have no responsibility for appraisal
work. Following the conclusion of a 1981 internal study to increase the
effectiveness of these offices, SOFIDE tightened cost controls and set
precise operational targets and budgets for each of these offices. The
offices established in 1978/79 now function relatively well. It is too
early to assess the effectiveness of the Kananga office.
Operating Policies and Procedures
2.18      Policy Statement.  SOFIDE's operating and financial policies are
set by the Board and documented in a formal policy statement (Annex 4).
This sets, inter alia, the financing of economically and financially viable
projects as SOFIDE's main objective, establishes maximum limits of exposure
per client (up to 20% of equity and quasi-equity) and requires that SOFIDE



- 20 -
be managed on sound and businesslike principles. SOFIDE's policy statement
was reviewed and approved by IDA in conjunction with the previous lines of
credit and remains a sound basis for operations under this proposed credit.
2.19      Appraisal.  SOFIDE's Projects Department is responsiDle for both
project promotion and project appraisal. It has a staff of nine
professionals, including the Department head. Most oI them are experienced
in project work, except for three new recruits who work under the close
supervision of senior professional staff and are following an intensive
training program. SOFIDE's promotion efforts have been extensive and
successful. As a result, SOFIDE has a strong project pipeline (para.
2.47). Appraisal procedures, which had deteriorated somewhat in 1980 when
responsibility for appraisals was divided between three separate
departments, have improved substantially since the 1981 reorganization
(para. 2.16). The quality of appraisals is generally good. A committee
comprising all SOFIDE Department Directors reviews all appraisal reports
before they are submitted to top management and the Board. Appraisal
procedures are systematized and documented in a project manual.
2.20      Supervision.  Following the reorganization in 1981, when the
supervision function was mDved from the Finance Department to a newly
created Supervision and Technical Department, there was a considerable
improvement in the vigor and extent of supervision efforts. Five
professional staff in the Technical and Supervision Department now work
solely on supervision and the nine professionals in the regional offices
devote nearly 50% of their time to that activity. In addition, a loan
recovery unit was established in early 1983 in the Finance Department to
improve loan collection. Projects under supervision are visited at least
once a year and those which are in difficulties receive additional visits.
The regional offices supervise projects in their area of responsibility on
the basis of a program approved by the Supervision Department. Projects in
Kinshasa and in the areas that are outside the responsibillity )f any one
of the regional offices are supervised by headquarters. Recently, the
Federal Republic of Germany approved a SOFIDE request to finance the
services of an expert to help supervise and provide technical assistance to
its SSE clients. In view of the impact that the recent monetary reform
could have on the financial situation of SOFIDE's clients (para. 2.34), the
need for intensive supervision will be greater and SOFIDE has recruited a
new professional and transferred another to its Supervision Department.
2.21      Procurement and Disbursement.  Project sponsors are responsible
for procurement of items financed by SOFIDE. Even though SOFIDE does not
require international or local competitive bidding, it ensures that
procurement is made on the basis of competitive quotations (at least 3)
from a number of different suppliers (including foreign) from amongst whom
the promotor, with SOFIDE's assistance, selects the best offer on the basis
of price, after sales service, product specifications, quality and other
relevant crLteria. Because most projects are for rehabilitation of
existing plant and procurement packages are expected to be in the range of
US$30,000-600,000, with an average of US$300,000, these procedures are



- 21 -
adequate. All of SOFIDE' s appraisal reports justify the final choice of
procurement. SOFIDE then disburses against presentation of invoices or
relevant documentation after the preconditions for disbursements have been
made and the sponsors' equity paid in.
Accounts and Audit
2.22      Accounts are produced on time and are accurate.  Under the Sixth
IDA credit, SOFIDE drew up a plan to improve its accounting system,
following deficiencies which became evident in 1980/81. The plan is being
implemented on schedule and SOFIDE's accounting system is now
satisfactory. Procedures have been improved and are being codified in a
new accounting manual. Preparation for computerizing SOFIDE's accounting
is well advanced and SOFIDE expects to have the system in operation by
July 1984. SOFIDE has started to train its staff to run the new computer
based system. Both IDA and the Fonds de Cooperation Belge (Belgian
Cooperation) which financed the services of an expert for two years,
provided considerable assistance to SOFIDE in improving its accounting
system.
2.23      The audited annual reports and accounts for 1981 and 1982 were
received on time. Both were unqualified and of a quality acceptable to
IDA. The Brussels based firm of Berger, Block, Kirschen and Schellekens
and Co. has audited SOFIDE's accounts since its inception. The quality of
the audits has been satisfactory and in line with IDA's requirements.
The deadline for submission of the audited accounts by SOFIDE will be
maintained at six months after the end of its fiscal year as under the last
IDA credit for SOFIDE.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
2.24      SOFIDE's loans have maturities typically ranging between two and
ten years, depending on the type of project being financed. The average
loan maturity is about 6.5 years. SOFIDE takes adequate security and does
not accept subordination to any other lender. SOFIDE's interest rates are
not regulated by the central bank but set by its board, subject to the
limitations imposed by some foreign lenders on their lines of credit.
2.25      In the past, most of SOFIDE's foreign creditors imposed strict
ceilings regarding the final onlending rate SOFIDE could charge on subloans
financed out of their lines of credit. The resulting spreads were narrow
and did not permit SOFIDE to earn a sufficient return on these resources.
With IDA's assistance, SOFIDE made a concerted effort to convince its
foreign lenders to increase the maximum interest rates and spread they
allow SOFIDE to charge. The more important of SOFIDE's present foreign
creditors, such as EIB, KfW and ADB, have now adopted policies similar to
IDA's. Annex 9 gives details on the conditions of SOFIDE's foreign
borrowings.



- 22 -
2.26      About 10% of SOFIDE's present portfolio is in local currency and
the rest is in foreign exchange. On over 95Z of the portfolio in foreign
exchange, the final borrower carries the foreign exchange risk. About 15%
of the portf lio is financed out of foreign lines of credit with conditions
regarding interest rates. On foreign currency loans financed out of other
resources, until recently, SOFIDE was charging an interest rate of 20%
p.a., a commitment fee of 1.5% on the undisbursed committed amount and an
appraisal fee of 5%, with the full exchange risk being passed on to the
client. Following the recent devaluation and the establishment of a
floating exchange rate system, SOFIDE's board decided to reduce the
interest rate charged on new loans to 18% p.a. and the appraisal fee to
2%. This level of interest rates is still highly positive in real terms as
international inflation is expected to be between 8% and 9% over the next
rew years.
2.27      SOFIDE's interest rate on local currency loans is 30% p.a. with
commissions similar to those on foreign exchange loans. This rate is
negative in real terms, as Zaire's inflation is forecast to be about 45% in
1984; it is, however, projected to decrease to about 25%-30% in 1986-87.
So far, the demand for term lending for investment purposes in local
currency has been limited, because most investment was for equipment
rehabilitation and, thus, necessitated foreign exchange with little local
currency content. This relative lack of demand is evidenced by SOFIDE's
present liquidity position, which, as of end December 1983, showed cash
balances of about Z 100 million, i.e., US$3.3 million equivalent.
However, the recent monetary and exchange reforms could in the future
increase the demand for local currency loans as the Zaire is now
convertible. During negotiations of this credit, SOFIDE agreed to
periodically review its interest rate policy with IDA and change the rates
if conditions require.
2.28      The Project Agreement includes a covenant requiring SOFIDE to
maintain real positive interest rates on its free resources (foreign
exchange and local currency) and to exchange views regularly with IDA on
the suitability of its onlending rates.
Coverage of the Foreign Exchange Risk
2.29      Prior to 1979, the Government bore the foreign exchange risk on
all foreign loans to SOFIDE. In 1979, however, the Government informed
SOFIDE that in future it would no longer be willing to carry the foreign
exchange risk on SOFIDE's foreign debt, other than on an exceptional
basis. Accordingly, SOFIDE started passing on the foreign exchange risk to
its sub-borrowers and agreed with Government on a mechanism to protect it
from the foreign exchange risk on loans contracted prior to that time.
This mechanism also covers the residual foreign exchange risk where
repayments by sub-borrowers take place earlier than SOFIDE's repayment
schedule to foreign creditors. These arrangements have worked well and
adequately protect SOFIDE. Annex 5 gives details of the mechanism
established with Government.

C. Operations
2.30      As of September 1983, SOFIDE had approved 669 loans and equity
investments amounting to Z 1.4 billion in total, equivalent to about US$
261 million 5/ (Annex 10).  In constant 1980 US dollars (SOFIDE's
operations aire for the most part foreign exchange loans), approvals
increased from about US$16 million in 1975 to US$18 million in 1976 and
then jumped to about US$34 million per year in 1977, 1978 and 1979. In
1980 and 1981, approvals fell to about US$22 million per year, mainly
because of lack of resources. In the mid-to-late 1970s, SOFIDE had a very
active promotion policy and constantly overestimated the amount of foreign
exchange it could mobilize. Many projects were thus appraised and approved
in anticipation of resources which did not materialize or materialized at a
much later date. IDA missions advised SOFIDE to be mDre cautious in this
regard. Since 1981, SOFIDE appraises and approves projects only if
resources are available for commitment. As of December 31, 1983, about 75%
of the loan approvals had been committed and 65% disbursed.
2.31      The number of SOFIDE'S operations has increased steadily over the
past few years from 51 in 1977 to 125 in 1983. This was mainlv due to the
increase in SOFIDE's loans to SSEs (para. 2.33). In 1983, the
manufacturing sector (including agro-industry) accounted for 53% of
approvals, agriculture for 23%, construction 9% and transport 8%.
Approvals to mining and services projects made up the remaining 7%. Of the
total amount of approvals in 1983, 77% was for rehabilitation and expansion
of existing projects and 17% for new projects. The remaining 6% was for
working capital loans which SOFIDE started to provide in 1980 to alleviate
the acute shortage of foreign exchange on the operations of existing
enterprises.  These working capital loans were financed out of the fifth
IDA Credit (998-ZR, approved in FY1980) and a KfW line of credit.
2.32      All of SOFIDE's loans have been to private (or majority private)
firms. SOFIDE has progressively increased regional diversification of its
investments. In 1983, loans to firms in or around Kinshasa accounted for
only 24% of SOFIDE's approvals by amount, compared to 36% in 1980. Bas
Zaire was second with 19% and Shaba third with 14%. The average loan' size
in SOFIDE's portfolio is currently about US$340,000, ranging from an
average of US$155,000 in agriculture, forestry and livestock to US$230,000
in agro-industries and US$497,000 in manufacturing. Most major industrial
and agro-industrial firms, which SOFIDE lends to are foreign-owned or have
foreign majority interest, in keeping with the usual ownership patterns in
Zaire industry-wide.
5/ At the average exchange rate for each year.



- 24 -
2.33      Over the past five years SOFIDE has increased its assistance to
SSEs. In 1983, loans to small-scale enterprises accounted for about 80%of
approvals by number and about 54% by value. SOFIDE's growing promotional
activity for SSEs is due both to its own conviction that a st-ong SSE
sector is essential to Zaire's economic development and to the availability
of resources provided by several foreign lenders to be used exclusively for
financing SSEs. Financing SSEs, however, has proven costly to SOFIDE for
several reasons: (i) there has been no effective agency in Zaire
responsible for providing assistance to small scale enterprises and thus
SOFIDE has had to assume the cost of preparing projects and of helping
small entrepreneurs implement them in addition to its financing role; xiii)
despite the high cost of transport in Zaire, SOFIDE tried to assist
projects all over the national territory; and (iii) the resources available
for financing SSE's often had conditions that restricted the financial
spread SOFIDE could earn on them. SOFIDE is now reviewing its SSE program
to reduce its costs, while maintaining (or possibly increasing) its
activity in this area. SOFIDE is considering the possibility of
establishing a separate unit, possibly in association with OPEZ or one of
the bilateral aid agencies, to help SSEs prepare and implement projects
while SOFIDE retains the financing role. In the meantime, SOFIDE has
obtained technical assistance from CIDA and KfW to strengthen its SSE
capabilities and to help defray the costs of this activity. As already
noted (para. 1.24), one of the studies to be financed under the technical
assistance/studies component of the project recommended in this report
would be the preparation of an action program for improving the assistance
to SSEs in Zaire, including a review of how OPEZ can be revitalized into an
effective agency responsible for providing technical assistance to SSEs.
D. Portfolio and Provisions
2.34      During the last few years the difficult international economic
situation has had an adverse impact on many clients of DFCs supported by
the World Bank Group. Increasingly this has been reflected in the
portfolio situation of many of these institutions. Given the crisis
affecting the Zairian economy since 1975, SOFIDE is no exception. Because
of the improved supervision effort (para. 2.20) and the vigorous loan
recovery actions introduced over the past two years, however, SOFIDE's
portfolio is still intrinsically sound and of an acceptable quality. At
the same time, the comprehensive package of stabilization measures adopted
by the Zairian authorities in September 1983 (para. 1.03) and,
particularly, the large devaluation of the Zaire may cause increased
short-term difficulties for some of SOFIDE's clients and will require
increased attention. The further steps recommended in this report to deal
with SOFIDE's portfolio difficulties (para. 2.36) constitute one of this
proposed operation's major features. They build on previous efforts and
are aimed at containing deterioration in portfolio quality in the future.



- 25 -
2.35     Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1983 SOFIDE had a small equity
portfolio of Z 25.2 million outstanding in ten companies and a loan
portfolio of Z 803.9 million outstanding in 264 projects, of which 110,
representing 45% of the total portfolio in amount, were still under
implementation. Total arrears of more than three months at the same date
amounted to Z 34.1 million (about US$1.1 million), or a modest 4% of the
total outstanding loan portfolio, and affected 79 projects, the total
outstanding of which represented 17% of the value of the loan portfolio.
Most of these projects were small agricultural and industrial projects in
operation. Despite the economic difficulties of the last three years,
arrears of more than three months relative to total portfolio as well as
the percentage of portfolio affected by arrears were reduced almost by half
(from 7% at end September 1980 to 4% at end December 1983 and from 30% to
17% at the same dates). This improvement was due to greater effort to
improve loan collection and the increased emphasis given to supervision
work following the 1981 reorganization (paras. 2.16 and 2.20).
2.36      The impact of the recent economic reforms, while beneficial for
the economy in the medium- and long-term, will result in some short-term
financial distress amongst SOFIDE's clients which will likely affect
SOFIDE's portfolio health. Because of the September 1983 devaluation, the
arrears situation is expected to deteriorate in the coming months. It is
foreseen that a number of SOFIDE's borrowers who bear the foreign exchange
risk will face severe short-term financial problems and that special
measures (such as debt rescheduling, reduction of project scope) may have
to be agreed upon between SOFIDE and its borrowers. Appraisal mission
estimates indicate that some 18 subborrowers (accounting for about 16% of
outstanding loans), would have difficulties reimbursing SOFIDE unless some
of these special measures are put into place.  These  projects are, for the
most part, small projects still under execution in the agricultural
sector. They also include, however, three large industrial projects which
account for about 11% of the total loan portfolio. Another 34 subborrowers
accounting for 31% of the loan portfolio may encounter some repayment
problems. Against this background, a major objective of this project is to
assist SOFIDE to prepare and implement an action program to tackle this
situation. As recommended by IDA, SOFIDE undertook a comprehensive
supervision of the 18 problem projects as well as the 34 projects with
possible repayment problems with a view to identifying measures to ease the
financial distress of those enterprises considered to be viable with the
help of some restructuring and to close out, and provide for, those loans
without prospect for repayment. Two reports submitted to IDA in February
1984 and April 1984 reviewed in detail the implementation or operation of
these 52 projects, reassessed the financial situation of the promotors
(many of whom have substantial commercial activities) and made new cash
flow projections for each of the 52 projects taking into account new
conditions of supply of essential inputs, cost of production, prices and
demand. On the basis of this detailed analysis, SOFIDE took the following
actions:



- 26 -
(i) loan rescheduling for 24 borrowers with the repayment
period extended from 6 months to 4 years, depending on
the situation of the project (the original maturity on
some of these loans was 3 years);
(ii) establishment of a new schedule for payment of interest
arrears or capitalization of interest arrears in 12
cases;
(iii) request additional security from 4 borrowers;
(iv) supplementary loans to 6 borrowers to enable them to
complete their projects; in 2 cases, the promotors are
also requested to bring in additional equity;
(v) reduction in the scope or redesign of 4 projects;
(vi) request 2 borrowers to reorganize their enterprise and
recruit additional technical personnel;
(vii) organize the sale of unused material and a building to
recover arrears from 2 borrowers. In one case, SOFIDE
will also take over the management of the project; and
(viii)  the decision to recall a loan unless the promotor takes
the measures recommended by SOFIDE.
With these various measures, SOFIDE estimated that 39 of these projects
will be able to improve their situation. For the remaining 13 kept under
the problem project category with a total outstanding of Z 140 million (17%
of the loan portfolio), specific provisions amounting to Z 9.2 million
(US$310,000), or more than 90% of the arrears, have been constituted.
These measures are adequate and at negotiations SOFIDE agreed with IDA on
an action plan to carry them out. The plan is detailed and lists all the
actions to be taken for each project with a specific timetable for their
implementation. Essentially, it calls for loan rescheduling and additional
security to be agreed with and/or obtained from borrowers between April
1984 and June 1984; gives promotors of projects with weak management five
months to reorganize their enterprise and recruit additional technical
personnel, often with SOFIDE's assistance; and proposes to institute legal
proceedings against 10 borrowers if arrears were not paid by July 1984.
The plan also envisages to recall one loan in June 1984 if measures
recommended by SOFIDE to restructure the project were not taken and makes
the .;,tlement of arrears and/or the paying-in of additional equity a
condition for supplementary loans by SOFIDE. During supervision missions
IDA will closely monitor the implementation of this action plan.



- 27 -
2.37      Provisions.  Following a drop in provisions to about 2.1% of
outstanding portfolio in 1981, SOFIDE agreed, under the sixth IDA credit,
to a covenant binding it not to distribute any dividends until the amount
of general and specific provisions for risk constituted at least 4% of the
total outstanding loan and equity portfolio. This level of provisions was
considered the minimum necessary to reflect the risk profile of SOFIDE's
portfolio. At the end of December 1983, SOFIDE's level of provisions
exceeded the required 4%.
E. Financial Results and Condition
2.38      Profitability.  SOFIDE's income statements and balance sheets for
1978-1983 and the relevant financial ratios are summarized in Annexes
13-15. SOFIDE's profitability record has been poor in recent years.
Although nominal profitability increased from Z 0.6 million in 1980 to Z
14.6 million in 1983 when it represented a return on equity of 26Z and a
rate of return on average total assets of 2%, this was not enough to
compensate for the erosion of SOFIDE's equity by inflation. Thus, despite
the serious efforts SOFIDE made to increase profitability by raising
interest rates and cutting costs, its equity base (including reserves)
decreased from the equivalent of US$4.7 million in 1979 to about US$1.2
million following the devaluation of September 1983.
2.39      SOFIDE's low profitability, despite its general efficiency and
competence, is due mainly to the effect of sustained high inflation (about
45% per annum since 1979) on a fixed rate term lending institution. Thus,
the increase in administrative costs (which was mostly due to high domestic
inflation) could not be readily passed on in higher interest charges.
Although much of the portfolio base was indexed (most loans were
denominated in foreign exchange) devaluations did not take place regularly
and were often insufficient to compensate for the increase in costs.
Moreover, the limited spreads that some foreign lenders allowed SOFIDE on
subloans financed out of their lines of credit also hurt SOFIDE's
profitability. This was not enough to (i) cover the administrative costs,
overheads and related provisions for risk; and (ii) allow SOFIDE to earn a
reasonable return on equity. Recently, the more important of SOFIDE's
foreign creditors agreed to allow SOFIDE a more important spread (Annex 9).
Prospects for SOFIDE's future profitability are also brighter now with the
recent mDnetary and exchange reforms (para. 2.52) even though they may
result in some temporary disruptions as its clients adjust to the new
condition. This can, in the short run, place a burden on SOFIDE's
finances.
2.40      Capital.  As noted in vara. 2.06, as of December 1983, SOFIDE's
authorized share capital was Z 12.0 million, all of which was paid in.
Owing to the massive September 1983 devaluation, this represents only
US$0.4 million compared to about US$4.0 million in 1980 when the last
capital iJTcrease (from Z 4.0 million to Z 12.0 million) took place.



- 28 -
Reserves and retained earnings, excluding revaluation surplus, amounted to
Z 15.3 million (i.e. about US$0.5). Quasi-equity amounted to Z 382.6
million (US$12.7 million). The long-term debt to equity and quasi equity
ratio stood at 1.0:1, well within the maximum 5:1 agreed with IDA. As
described in paras. 2.07 and 2.08 above, however, SOFIDE's Board had
approved a general capital increase to Z 260 million to take place before
the end of 1984. This will substantially strengthen SOFIDE's capital
structure.
2.41      The overall financial situation of SOFIDE remains sound and
creditworthy, despite weak profitability in recent years. Its liquidity
situation is good. Net current assets amount to Z 443 million with a
current ratio of more than 5:1. Cash and deposits with banks are Z 100
million. Its capital structure, already sound, should improve following
the proposed capital increase. Its asset/liability maturity structure
(with most of its debts and quasi-equity being of a much longer duration
than its loans), gives it the flexibility to cope with portfolio problems
that might develop in the next two to three years. SOFIDE's management is
capable and has proved willing to adopt the policies necessary to ensure
that SOFIDE remains an effective intermediary. SOFIDE's board is sound and
businesslike. In particular, the presence of IFC and DEG on SOFIDE's board
has contributed to strong and decisive actions in the areas of interest
rate policies. Moreover, an improved policy environment following the
measures adopted by the Government in September 1983 will help strengthen
SOFIDE's medium- and long-term profitability.
2.42      Resources.  SOFIDE's resources come from its capital, reserves,
retained earnings and long-term borrowings. It is not allowed to take
short-term deposits. SOFIDE's resource position as of December 31, 1983 is
included in the basic data. At that date, SOFIDE had the equivalent of
US$33.4 million available for commitments and Z 646.9 million (US$21.6
million) available for approval, of which Z 57.1 million (US$1.9 million)
was in local currency and Z 589.8 million (US$19.7 million) in foreign
exchange (para. 2.49). SOFIDE has been remarkably successful in
diversifying its borrowing sources. The close and constant support of IDA
played an important catalytic role in enabling SOFIDE to attract resources
from eight different foreign creditors. The most recent was a line of
credit for the equivalent of US$5.0 million from CIDA. However, half of
the resources available for commitment or approval should be used under
specific conditions relating to size, region, type of project, or
procurement. As a result, it is difficult for SOFIDE to find suitable
projects to rapidly commit these funds, while other projects in the
pipeline, which are also of high economic priority, cannot be accommodated
for lack of resources. The project recommended in this report would
provide SOFIDE with additional resources to be used more freely according
to its general policies and procedures.

F. Prospects
SOFIDE's Strategy
2.43      (a) Investment Policy.  SOFIDE will likely continue to be the
sole financial institution providing term foreign exchange resources to the
productive sectors in Zaire. SOFIDE's investment strategy, which was
adopted in 1978 and which sets out criteria for project selection, was
amended in late 1983 by SOFIDE's Board to give a higher priority to export
projects and the rehabilitatie U: enterprises producing basic goods.
This approach makes good sense. SuvIDE's investments will remain
concentrated in manufacturing, transport, commercial agriculture, and
agro-industry.
2.44      (b) Operating SLrategy.  In spite of generally adequate policies,
SOFIDE lacked a comprehensive plan aimed at achieving sufficient
profitability to protect its equity base from erosion by inflation. In
this adjustment period, following the recent package of policy measures, at
the Board's request, SOFIDE's management had prepared such a plan which
reviewed and made recommendations on (a) the interest rate and fee
structure SOFIDE should adopt; (b) future growth plans for SOFIDE; (c) type
of clients SOFIDE should be seeking (by size, region, sector etc.); (d)
measures to lower the costs of providing assistance to SSEs and projects In
the interior (para. 2.33); (e) future policy regarding regional offices;
and (f) whether it would be remunerative to pursue a more active equity
participation policy. At negotiations, SOFIDE submitted a copy of this
strategy review which was found satisfactory by IDA. The proposed strategy
was also approved by SOFIDE's board in April 1984 and Is being put into
effect.
2.45      One of the elements of SOFIDE's future strategy is a more active
policy of equity participations. SOFIDE is considering making investments
in a number of profitable firms with good growth prospects. This would
help SOFIDE strengthen its finances. SOFIDE's equity particip'tion would
also help bring an element of Zairian ownership to a number of ioreign
owned firms, some of which have been Interested in associating with serious
local partners. Thus, this project includes a component of up to US$4.0
million which could be used for equity participation in foreign exchange,
provided that in each case SOFIDE takes measures, satisfactory E-o IDA, to
protect itself against the foreign exchange risk. If adequate measures
could not be found, the funds reserved for this component would be used for
sub-loans.
Operations
2.46      Credit Demand and Project Pipeline.  The recent stabilization
measures adopted by the Government of Zaire have had a major impact on the
country's productive sectors and could adversely affect investment
intentions-and thus investment credit demand-in the short term.  It is
unlikely that this will affect SOFIDE's level of operations, however,



- 30 -
because: (i) the needs of the productive sectors for rehabilitation and
modernization are substantial and exceed by far the resources that SOFIDE
could possibly mobilize. In the textile sector alone, a Bank report
prepared ir. 1981 estimated the rehabilitation needs to be more than US$100
million. For the whole ma-iufacturing s.actor, the appraisal mission
estimates that these needs probably exceed US$500 million. In addition,
the financing requirements of the private transport sector are also large;
(ii) due to the scarcity and cost of foreign exchange, many companies want
to make investments to lessen their dependence on imported inputs
(particularly energy related); (iii) most enterprises interviewed by the
appraisal mission indicated that they plan to proceed with their investment
programs. SOFIDE also contacted about a dozen promoters of projects
recently approved but not yet signed. All but one of them maintained their
loan application with SOFIDE; and (iv) the increase in SOFIDE's lending
limit per client (para. 2.07) should improve its ability to assist large
firms in Zaire which have substantial investment needs.
2.47      SOFIDE's pipeline only contains projects at a fairly advanced
stage of preparation, which are expected to be appraised and approved
within the next year or so. The present list consists of 43 industrial
(including agro-industry) and transport projects which would require
financing of about US$21 million and 50 agricultural and forestry projects
which would require about US$15 million. Most of the projects in the
industrial and services sectors are for rehabilitation or modernization of
existing concerns in a number of subsectors, including textiles, beverages,
transport and construction. The few new projects are all small ventures
promoted for the most part by Zairian entrepreneurs. The agricultural
pipeline also shows a broad sub-sectoral mix (livestock, forestry, export
crops such as coffee, transport equipment to collect agricultural products,
rice cultivation., etc.). Most agricultural projects are also for
rehabilitation and modernization of existing enterprises.
2.48      Forecast Operations.  SOFIDE's operational forecasts is shown in
annex 16. The forecasts are based on the average level of approvals over
the 1981-1983 period and adjusted to show an increase of 5Z per annum in
real terms. The level of commitments and disbursements is related to the
level of approvals on the basis of SOFIDE's experience in recent years.
These projections and underlying assumptions are realistic given SOFIDE's
past growth in operations, pent up demand for investment credit in Zaire,
and projected resource availability. SOFIDE's experience since its
inception has shown that resource availability has been the main constraint
to increased operations. Approvals are expected to increase from about
US$25 million equivalent in 1984 to about US$34 million in 1987.
Commitments over the same period (which covers the period of commitment of
the proposed loan) are expected to total US$116.3 million, of which about
80% would be in foreign exchange. Disbursements over the period total
about US$103 million.

half of 1985 which will increase to about US$62 million by the end of
1987. In fact, the effective resource gap may develop earlier since about
50% of SOFIDE's available resources have conditions which make them
difficult to commit rapidly (para. 2.42). The recommended amount for the
investment component of the proposed IDA Credit (US$33.5 million) will
cover about 54% of SOFIDE's foreign exchange gap. SOFIDE expects to cover
the balance of its needs through further borrowings from EIB (at least
US$12 million), KfW (an indicated US$4 million) and from the African
Development Bank. SOFIDE is also pursuing other sources of funds such as
CCCE to enable it to reach its operations forecast. Local currency



- 32 -
resource requirements will be met out of rolled-over' IDA and other funds,
and a loan from the Economic Development Fund.
Projected Financial Condition and Results
2.51      The financial projections of SOFIDE for the period 1984-87 are
shown in Annexes 16-20. These forecasts are presented in current terms,
taking into account forecast inflation and devaluation of the Zaire in line
with the differential between domestic and international inflation. The
projections, based on conservative assumptions regarding the level of
operations, interest rates applied and loan collections, show that the
recent devaluation of the Zaire (which increased SOFIDE's portfolio by
threefold in local currency terms) significantly improved the profitability
prospects for SOFIDE. The projected increase in interest income following
the devaluation is expected to outpace the rise in administrative expenses
and other costs to enable SOFIDE to maintain provisions to at least 4% of
its medium- and long-term portfolio during theperiod 1984-87.
Administrative costs in the future will fall to about 2% of average total
assets, a level which is comparable to similar development banks elsewhere
(the ratio in recent years was about 7-8%).
2.52      During the coming years, SOFIDE will have to improve its
financial performance to build up adequate provisions and retain its local
and foreign private shareholders, who in the past have lost most of their
investment in SOFIDE because of high inflation and periodic devaluations.
For this reason, it was agreed during negotiations that funds from the
proposed credit would be onlent by Government to SOFIDE at a minimum of
8.5% p.a. and that SOFIDE would be required to charge at least 15.5% p.a.
on subloans financed out of this credit. At present, SOFIDE charges 18% on
its foreign exchange loans, but is under pressure to decrease interest
rates (paras. 2.26 to 2.28) since its clients are bearing the foreign
exchange risk while the Zaire is floating. The recommended minimum 8.5%
onlending rate by Government is intended to give SOFIDE the flexibility to
lower interest rates in the future if it appears that the cost of its loans
inhibits credit demand, or if the overall conditions improve -- e.g., if
inflation diminishes below forecast levels. Should SOFIDE decide to set
its interest rates at a level higher than 15.5%, the onlending rate by
Government will be similarly adjusted so as to maintain a 7X spread. This
will allow SOFIDE to show a return on equity in real terms of about 15%
over the 1984-1990 period. To ensure that SOFIDE continues to give
priority to the constitution of provisions, it was further agreed that the
covenant under the sixth IDA credit requiring SOFIDE not to declare any
dividends before provisions for risk attain a level of at least 4% of its
equity and medium- and long-term loan portfolio would be maintained.
2.53      The projections also show that SOFIDE's financial structure will
remain sound, particularly with the projected capital increase (para.



- 33 -
2.07) and the quasi-equity contributed by Government. Over the period
1984-87, net profit would represent about 4% of average total assets, a
substantial improvement compared to the past few years, while the debt
service coverage never fall below 2.7. Unlike in recent years when the
value of equity was constantly eroded, net worth would increase from about
US$8 million in 1984 to US$11 million in 1987. The projected level of
quasi-equity and shareholder equity is expected to be sufficient to keep
SOFIDE's debt-to-equity and quasi-equity ratio well within the prudent 5:1
limit agreed to with IDA in the ontext of the fifth and sixth credit.
This limit should be retained under the proposed project.
2.54      The asset!liability maturity structure is expected to retain ts
present characteristics (i.e. debt liabilities with a much longer term
maturity than loan assets). This should contribute to financial strength,
allow SOFIDE to keep a good liquidity position and enable it to overcome
any portfolio problems in the foreseeable future.
III. The Project
A. Project Objectives and Justification
3.01      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to (a)
provide the foreign exchange needed to finance the rehabilitation/
reconstruction and modernisation of high economic priority, financially
viable projects, and on an exceptional basis, of new projects; (b) continue
to support SOFIDE to enable it to retain its effectiveness as the only
institution in Zaire providing term investment finance in foreign exchange
to the productive sectors. This institutional support is particularly
needed at a time when SOFIDE - like many other DFCs worldwide -- is faced
with growing portfolio problems owing to the financial distress which many
of its clients are undergoing; and (c) improve the dialogue with Government
on sector policies and issues through the provision of technical assistance
aimed at strengthening Government capabilities in sector policy analysis.
3.02      For more than a decade IDA has been associated with SOFIDE,
providing resources, advice and technical assistance. IDA staff have also
closely monitored its progress in developing into a strong institution
capable of financing sound projects. SOFIDE has performed well, but given
the difficult environment in which it has operated since 1973, it will
continue to need support and assistance to maintain and improve its
effectiveness. In the immediate future, as the Zairiaa economy goes
through a process of major adjustments, SOi'IDE will require IDA's advice
and support to help implement an action program aimed at maintaining the
quality of its portfolio and increasing profitability (para. 2.36). The
proposed project has and would enable IDA to provide this advice and to



- 34 -
continue its financial assistance to SOFIDE. At the same time, the project
would also enable IDA to step up a dialogue with Government on industrial
sector related issues and to help build up the capabilities of the Zairian
Government in this area.
B. Amount, Use and Terms
3.03      The proposed IDA credit of US$36.0 million would be made to
Government. Government would onlend US$33.5 million to SOFIDE under a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Association, the signing of
which would be a condition of credit effectivwness. The Credit would
include the following components:
(a) Investment Component (US$33.5 million): This component
will finance the foreign exchange costs of SOFIDE
subprojects. Of this amount, at least US$5.0 million
would be for export oriented projects, and at nost
US$4.0 million would be reserved for SOFIDE's equity
participations. The SOFIDE line of credit would cover
about 54% of the total of SOFIDE's projected foreign
currency requirements through end-1987;
(b) Technical Assistance/Industrial Policy Component
(US$2.25 million): This component would finance the
total cost (including a small local cost component of
about US$50,000 for local experts and consultants) of
technical assistance to Government, sector policy and
subsector studies, and a limited amount of equipment to
improve the collection and treatment of statistical
data on industrial sector performance. This component
seeks to improve Government capability to better
formulate and implement industrial sector policies; and
(c) Technical Assistance to CEPETEDE (US$0.25 million):
This component would finance the foreign exchange cost
of internationally-recruited experts by CEPETEDE to run
high level courses in project appraisal and related
topics, overseas training of CEPETEDE staff, and a
limited amount (US$80,000 maximum) of equipment (mainly
for data processing).
The Proposed Line of Credit for Investments (US$33.5 million)
3.04      This component, which accounts for 93% of the proposed credit,
would finance the foreign exchange costs of capital investments, including
initial working capital, in subprojects approved by SOFIDE. The funds
would be available to finance subprojects in the industrial, transport,
agro-industrial and agricultural sectors. Projects financed will be



- 35 -
selected by SOFIDE in accordance with its investment strategy and justified
on the basis of a full economic analysis, including calculation of the
economic rate of return cn all non-service sector projects. Priority
would be given to projects for the rehabilitation of existing industrial
and agricultural capacity, particularly those producing goods meeting basic
needs, and for export. Under the fifth and sixth credits, in order to
ensure that high priority was given to projects in the agriculture and
agro-industrial sectors, a certain amount of the credits was earmarked for
projects in these sectors. As a result, SOFIDE's financing of agricultural
projects increased rapidly over the last few years and represented 25% of
total approvals in 1981-83, i.e., the second most important sector after
manufacturing (para. 2.31 and Annex 11). Given SOFIDE's good performance
in financing agricultural projects and its strong agricultural pipeline
(para. 2.47), it would not be necessary to earmark funds for agricultural
projects under this proposed operation. However, to encourage SOFIDE to
promote more export oriented projects, US$5 million would be reserved for
projects which export at least 25% of their production. In addition, at
most US$4.0 million would be allocated to equity participation, provided
that SOFIDE take measures satisfactory to IDA to protect itself against the
foreign exchange risk. If adequate measures could not be formed, the funds
reserved for equity participation would be used for sub-loans.
3.05      Onlending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk.  SOFIDE would onlend
funds under the investment component to ultimate beneficiaries at a minimum
interest rate of 15.5% per annum and pass on the foreign exchange risk to
subborrowers. Government would onlend the proceeds of the investment
component to SOFIDE at a minimum rate of 8.5% per annum and a commitment
fee of 0.75% per annum on the undisbursed balance of the credit. The
resulting spread of 7 percentage points would enable SOFIDE to attain
adequate profitability, to protect its capital base from erosion by
inflation, and to maintain a strong financial situation.
3.06      Free Limit.  The individual subloan free limit would be raised
from US$300,000 applied under the sixth IDA Credit to US$500,000 in
recognition of the general quality of SOFIDE's appraisals. With regard to
equity participation, as this is a relatively new activity for SOFIDE, the
first five operations would be reviewed by IDA. The aggregate free limit
would be US$12.0 million, representing 35% of the amount of the line of
Credit. With this free limit,it is estimated that about 20-25 subprojects
will require IDA review prior to approval. This is sufficient for the
purpose of effective subproject monitoring by IDA.
3.07    Amortization Schedules.  The subsidiary loan agreement (Government
to SOFIDE) would have a flexible amortization schedule that would
substantially conform with the aggregate of the amortization schedules of
the subloans made by SOFIDE and financed under the proposed IDA Credit,
subject to a maximum of 15 years including a grace period not to exceed
three years. In order to inhibit prepayment, SOFIDE shall impose its normal
prepaymer.t commission on all subloans financed out of this investment
component that are repaid earlier than the initial amortization schedule



- 36 -
agreed upon between SOFIDE and the subborrower. Any amount used by SOFIDE
to take equity participations will be repaid over the 15 year period
referred to above.
3.08    Commitment Period.   The funds would be available for commitment by
SOFIDE until December 31, 1987.
The Technical Assistance/Industrial Policy Studies Component US$2.25
million)
3.09    Amounting to about 6% of the proposed credit, funds from this
component, lent to Government and managed by the Ministry of Planning and
SOFIDE, would finance the total cost of (i) technical assistance to
Government to improve its capability to formulate and implement industrial
sector policy and to improve the statistical data base on the productive
sectors; {ii) policy studies aimed at addressing specific sector issues and
improving the policy environment. Studies selected would have to conform
to the criteria agreed to with IDA in the context of the sixth credit for
SOFIDE (Annex 22); (iii) sector and sub-sector studies aimed at identifying
and preparing projects for possible financing by external donors; and (iv)
data processing and related equipment for INS (the National Institute of
Statistics) to enable it to improve its ability to gather and process
industrial statistics on a regular basis (a maximum of US$200,000 would be
used for this purpose). Annex 24 gives a list of studies and technical
assistance that this component is expected to finance. The studies and
action programs to be financed under this component would enable IDA and
the Government to pursue a more meaningful dialogue on sector issues,
following the major improvements in the macroeconomic policies carried out
in late 1983.
3.10    Terms and Conditions.  Each request for financing under this
component would be submitted to IDA for review and approval along with a
brief justification, detailed terms of reference, cost estimates and
financing plans for the local currency counterpart. Consultants financed
out of this component would be recruited in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. The findings of all the studies undertaken would be discussed
with IDA. Within the context of the supervision of this project, IDA would
also retain the right to review the work and progress of all experts
financed under this component.
3.il    Administration and Charge for Administrative Expenses.  SOFIDE will
be responsible for submitting all the relevant requests for disbursements
ill rc6p-s,-ct of this component to IDA. SOFIDE will charge a one time fee of
3.5% of the approved amount of each study accepted for financing to cover
the expenses it incurs in administering this facility.
3.12      Maximum Amount for Each Study.  In view of the limited amount of
this component, no more than US$300,000 would be allocated to any single
study/technical assistance project.



- 37 -
3.13      Commitment.  The funds under this component would be available
for commitment until December 31, 1987.
Technical Assistance Component to the CEPETEDE (US$0.25 million)
3.14    The remaining Credit funds, about one percent, would be earmarked
for this component. CEPETEDE is emerging as a well run inscitution that is
helping Government, SOFIDE and private enterprises increase the capacity of
staff in the areas of project evaluation and management. It continues to
require, however, IDA's support. The shortage of foreign exchange in Zaire
poses problems to CEPETEDE in obtaining necessary equipment, foreign
experts and overseas training of staff. Therefore, up to US$0.25 million
of the proposed IDA credit would be provided to enable CEPETEDE to: (i)
recruit foreign experts to run short-term high level courses for SOFIDE,
Government and Banque du Zaire officials, and private sector executives in
project analysis and management and on industrial sector policies and
related issues; (ii) provide, on a selective basis, training abroad for
CEPETEDF staff at courses such as those run by EDI and CEFEB (the CCCE
training center in banking studies); and (iii) finance the purchase of data
processing (micro-computer) type equipment and related items and
pedagogical material. This component would assist in the long-term task of
developing Zaire's human resource base. CEPETEDE would also continue to
receive significant assistance from FAC and CCCE in developing into an
efficient and capable training institution.
3.15    The funds allocated for this component would be passed on as a
grant from Government to CEPETEDE and would be available for commitment
until December 31, 1987.  To facilitate administration of the Credit,
SOFIDE has agreed to administer this component on behalf of CEPETEDE and to
submit all disbursement requests to IDA in respect of this component.
SOFIDE would charge a one-time fee of 3.5% of the amounts withdrawn as
administrative fees. The Association would approve all requests for
financing under this component.
C. Project Implementation
3.16      Reporting Requirements.  As it has done under previous credits,
SOFIDE would be required to submit to IDA quarterly reports, which would
include financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears and
notes on subprojects encountering serious operational difficulties. SOFIDE
would also be required to submit its annual report and audited annual
accounts prepared by qualified accountants for its operations, as it has
done in the past (paras. 2.22 and 2.23), and for the technical assistance/
studies and the CEPETEDE components that it has agreed to manage on behalf
of the Government (paras. 3.09 to 3.14).
Procuremenit and Disbursement
3.17      Procurement for the subprojects (US$33.5 million) financed under
the investment component, as well as for goods under the TA/Industrial



- 38 -
Policy Studies and the CEPETEDE components, would be on the basis of
competitive quotations from at least three different suppliers (including
foreign), a procedure acceptable to IDA (pare. 2.21). Given the relatively
modest size if procurement packages, the scope for international
competitive bidding is limited. Selection of consultants under the
TA/Industrial Policy Studies and CEPETEDE components would be made in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
3.18      The proceeds of this project would be disbursed as follows:
(a) On the technical assistance/studies and the technical
assistance to CEPETEDE components:
(i)  100Z of the total cost of technical assistance,
policy studies related to the industrial and
agro-industrial sectors, and eligible equipment up
to an aggregate amount of US$2.25 million; and
(ii) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of staff
training, technical assistance, and supplies
required by CEPETEDE up to an aggregate amount
equivalent to US$0.25 million.
(b) On SOFIDE subprojects:
Xi) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods or
services for eligible subprojects;
(ii) up to 85% of the cost of previously imported
equipment which is purchased locally in Zaire for
the subprojects;
(iii) up to 70% of the cost of equipment produced in
Zaire from previously imported components or raw
materials; and
(iv) up to 55% of the local cost of construction works
included in subprojects and carried out by locally
based contractors.
3.19      The projected disbursement schedule (Annex 23) is based on the
disbursement profile for IDF projects in East Africa modified to reflect
the experience under the relatively quick disbursing fourth and fifth
SOFIDE operations. Disbursements are expected to be completed over 6
years, by December 1990.



- 39 -
Project Benefits and Risks
3.20    The proposed project would provide term investment resources to the
productive sectors in Zaire to help rehabilitate industrial and
agro-industrial projects, improve private transport facilities and restore
agricultural production. It is expected that the investment component
(US$33.5 million) would support investments totalling about US$60.0 million
and would help rehabilitate or improve productive capacity of a much higher
value. It would also assist in maintaining, and possibly increasing,
employment levels in the productive sectors. The project would enable IDA
to continue supporting SOFIDE, the major term lending institution in Zaire,
to improve its effectiveness and institutional strength and thus enable it
to retain financial independence and autonomy. The action program for
portfolio improvement and monitoring (para. 2.36) would also enable IDA to
assist SOFIDE in containing any short-term deterioration in portfolio
quality as a result of the recent macroeconomic policy measures. As in the
past, continued IDA support would enhance SOFIDE's capability to mobilize
additional foreign exchange resources from other external lenders and
enable it to play a more significant role in assisting the recovery of the
productive sectors in Zaire. Finally, by helping improve the capability of
Government in sector policy formulation and implementation, the project
would open the way for Government and IDA to engage in a more meaningful
and comprehensive dialogue with the Zairian Government on a number of
sector issues (such as trade policies, export promotion) and on actions
needed to promote more effectively small-scale industry development in
Zaire.
3.21    The September 1983 policy reforms have removed many of the policy
distortions which had hitherto affected the industrial sector. The
devaluation and floating of the Zaire currency, in particular, have
improved the medium- and long-term outlook for SOFIDE's profitability.
Because of these changes and SOFIDE's proven management, the risks
associated with this project are acceptable. These risks relate mainly to
the likely impact on SOFIDE's borrowers of the difficult economic situation
as Zaire goes through the current adjustment process (see below).
3.22    Cases of corporate distress could become more frequent,
particularly if purchasing power falls further, and thus adversely affect
the quality of SOFIDE's portfolio and overall financial situation. This
risk is however limited (i) because many of SOFIDE's borrowers are long
established companies with good financial resilience; and (ii) because of
the strong action SOFIDE has already taken to improve its supervision and
loan recovery efforts and the comprehensive measures proposed in the
context of this project aimed at limiting portfolio deterioration and which
SOFIDE will implement in close consultation with IDA. This should ensure
that SOFIDE's financial situation will remain creditworthy and that it
would continue to be an effective term lending institution that promotes
economically justified investment projects. Moreover, this risk is amply
justified by the contribution that SOFIDE's operations are expected to make
to increased production of basic manufactured goods and agricultural
products, and to exports.

IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
4.01      This report recommends an IDA Credit of SDR 34.0 million (US$36.0
million) to the Republic of Zaire. SOFIDE would receive US$33.5 million,
CEPETEDE US$0.25 million, and the remaining US$2.25 million would be used
by Government for technical assistance and studies to improve the
formulation and implementation of industrial policies in Zaire. During
negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a)  From Government that it will:
(i) carry out the studies concerning assets
revaluation (para. 1.25(a)), indirect taxation and
earmarked taxes (para. 1.25 (b)), and effective
protection/incentives (para. 1.18) with
consultants whose qualifications and terms and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to
IDA and discuss with the Association the results
of these studies and a program to implement each
study's agreed recommendations;
(ii) onlend to SOFIDE the line of credit on the
conditions spacified in para. 3.05, including an
onlending rate of at least 8.5% per annum; and
(iii)  pass on to CEPETEDE as a grant US$0.25 million to
help it develop its training capabilities
(para. 3.15).
(b)  From SOFIDE that it will:
(i) implement the action program aimed at improving
the quality of its portfolio (para. 2.36);
(ii) relend the proceeds of this credit at terms and
conditions specified in paras. 3.05 to 3.08; and
(iii) exchange views regularly with IDA on the
suitability of its onlending rates (para. 2.28).
(c) Condition of effectiveness:
(i) paying-in of at least Z 100 million of the
proposed capital increase (para. 2.08); and
(ii) signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
(para. 3.03).

SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (SOFIDE)
Statement of General Policy
(Approved by SOFIDE's Board of Directors on February 10, 1970
and amended on March 14, 1973 and December 18, 1978)
The purpose of this Statement is to outline the policy that shall
be applied to the activities of the Societe Financiere de Developpement
hereinafter referred to as the Company, subject to any amendments that may
be made to this policy, after appropriate studies, by the Company's Board
of Directors.
I. OBJECTIVES AND OPERATIONAL CRITERIA
1.        The Company shall assist in the development of soundly managed
enterprises in the Republic of Zaire in all the productive sectors of the
economy. The Company may not, however, engage in activities relating
exclusively to land or housing nor in activities of a purely social,
commercial or consumption nature.
2.        The Company shall assist enterprises which are majority privately
owned. The Company will also assist, up to a limit of 25% of its
commitments, enterprises with juridical personality that have, in fact an
autonomous administration, financial management, accounting system and
control, and in which the State contributes directly or indirectly more
than 49% of their share capital. Those enterprises shall also meet all the
other eligibility requirements set forth in the Statutes and in the present
Statement of Policy.
3.        The Company shall extend its assistance on the basis of economic
and financial criteria only. Enterprises that submit projects to the
Company shall be required to have efficient management, be technically
sound, have satisfactory market prospects for their production, be able to
guarantee a financial return on the investment and generally to contribute
to the economic growth of the country. The Company shall take all these
different aspects into consideration when appraising the projects submitted
to it.
4.        The Company shall make every effort to foster the distribution of
industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market in the Republic
of Zaire. With this end in view it shall subscribe to issues of shares and
bonds in appropriate cases and shall sell shares from its portfolio,
provided that these operations are carried out under satisfactory
conditions and that the enterprises concerned are not prejudiced by such a
sale. The Company shall endeavor to create a market for its own shares in
the Republic of Zaire and to do everything within its power, within the
framework of the law and its own Statutes, to encourage Zairian investors
to participate in its capital.

Annex 4
page 2 of 4
5.        In accordance with Article 3 of its Statutes the Company shall
extend all kinds of assistance, financial and other, in keeping with its
objectives. The Company shall invest in the capital of enterprises and
shall subscribe to issues of shares and other securities. It shall grant
medium- and long-term loans, for periods depending on the type of project
involved, with a appropriate grace period. The Company may also furnish
guarantees in certain cases. It shall endeavour to actively promote the
establishment of new and the expansion of existing enterprises. It shall
give its clients technical assis.ance and advice on the planning, layout
and execution of their projects. These loans and participations may be
granted for construction work, purchase of plant and equipment and for the
constitution of permanent working cap.tal.
II. INVESTMENT POLICY
6.        The Company's assistance in the form of loans or participations
or both forms combined many not normally amount to less than Z 10,000.
However, the Company is prepared to consider requests for financing of
projects which, without reaching this amount, nevertheless present a
definite economic interest.
7.        As a general rule, the total amount of loans granted by the
Company together with its participations and any other commitments of a
financial nature in favor of a single enterprise may not exceed 20% of the
paid-up share capital, the unimpaired reserves and the quasi-capital
contributed by the Government pari passu with the share capital.
8.        The Company shall join with other financing institutions, whether
local, foreign or international, in financing projects whose financial
requirements exceed its capacity.
9.        The Company's total investments in the form of equity
participations may not exceed the total of the Company's share capital plus
unimpaired reserves and the government advance of Z 1 million ranking pari
passu with the share capital.
10.       As a general rule, the Company shall limit its equity
participation in any one enterprise to a maximum of 10% of its own share
capital plus unimpaired reserves and the government advance of Z 1 million
ranicing pari passu with the share capital.
11.       Generally, the Company shall not assume managerial
responsibilities in enterprises it assists and shall limit its share
participations to 25% of the share capital of any given enterprise. It
may, however, by unanimous decision of the Board, exceed this percentage
and even assume managerial responsibility if this is justified by the
circumstances or the nature of the enterprise. The Company may also,
notwithstanding the above restrictions, taken any action it considers
essential to protect its investments.

Annex 4
page 3 of 4
12.       When the Company underwrites an issue of shares or other
securities, it may commit itself for an initial amount in excess of the
limits fixed in the above Articles 10 and 11, as long as it has good
reasons to believe that its final investment will remain within those
limits.
13.       When deciding upon the amount and form of financial assistance it
shall provide, the Company shall take into account all the financial
requirements of the project and the financial situation of the enterprise
in question. In principle, the loans the Company grants shall not together
exceed 50% of the total cost of the project. It may, however, exceed this
limit if there is special justification, such as in the case of an
expansion project.
14.       The Company shall endeavour to maintain a balanced portfolio by
distributing its loans, participations and other commitments among all the
sectors of industrial and economic activity within the range of its
objectives.
III. FINANCIAL POLICY
r
15.       The general aim of the Company's financial policy is to maintain
the value of its own capital, to manage its funds in such a way that it is
at all times to honor its obligations on time and to achieve a profit
margin that enables it to cover its operating costs, form adequate reserves
and distribute reasonable dividends to its shareholders. To this end the
Company shall:
- maintain a satisfactory balance between the maturities
of its own obligations and those of the loans it grants;
- not incur debts of more than one year of term in excess
of five times the amount of its capital plus quasi-
capital;
- generally require appropriate guarantees for the loans
it grants;
- fi2: its interest rates, commissions, and other charges
at a level that will enable it to obtain a satisfactory
return;
- make adequate provisions against potential losses and
build up reserves to a level consistent with sound
financial practices, taking into account the size and
quality of its portfolio of loans and investments as
well as the need to pay adequate dividends to its
shareholders.

IV. ORGANIZATION - SPECIAL PROVISIONS
16.       The Company shall strive to develop and maintain a solid and
well-balanced organization and a management team capable of appraising the
financing proposals put before it, assisting enterprises in the formulation
of their projects and supervising their execution. With this in view it
shall give special attention to the training of its professional staff both
locally and abroad. Professional and other staff shall be recruited solely
on the basis of their professional qualifications.
17.       The Company shall require that its borrowers have an accounting
system which meets the requirements of sound management. It shall, as far
as it is possible, exercise the right to check the activities and inspect
the accounts and books of the companies it finances.
18.       The Company's own accounts shall be kept in accordance with
generally accepted international standards. The Company shall engage the
services of an independent firm of professional accountants of
international repute to audit its annual accounts.
19.       The Company may undertake the management of special funds only on
condition that such management does not, in the view of the Board of
Directors, interfere with the Company's capacity to fulfull its main
objective of promoting and financing productive investments. Such funds
shall only be managed by the Company on condition that it receives a
remuneration to be determined in the light of the service rendered.

SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (SOFIDE)
Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk
In the 1970 Establishment Convention of SOFIDE, the Government
agreed to assume the foreign exchange risk on SOFIDE's foreign exchange
debt up to a ceiling of US$30 million. This provision did not cover the
IDA credits and the OPEC Special Fund loan for which the Government had
provided separate guarantees for the portion of the loan/credits on which
the sub-borrowers did not bear the foreign exchange risk. In 1979, the
Government advised SOFIDE that whereas it would honor its engagements under
the terms of the convention on existing borrowings, in future it would only
assume the foreign exchange risk in specific cases as agreed to in advance
by Government.
A Protocole d'Accord, signed in February 1980, between SOFIDE and
OGEDEP, provided for OGEDEP to repay to foreign creditors all the amounts
due by SOFIDE in respect of borrowings guaranteed by Government and on
which the sub-borrowers do not bear the foreign exchange risk. The
Protocole d'Accord also provides for OGEDEP to cover, on those foreign
exchange borrowings under which the sub-borrower carries the foreign
exchange risk, the residual foreign exchange risk between the time of loan
collection by SOFIDE from the sub-borrower and repayment by SOFIDE to the
external lender. The Protocole d'Accord also establishes that, except in
the case of specific categories of sub-borrowers to be agreed upon with
Government on a case-by-case basis, SOFIDE will seek to pass on to its
sub-borrowers the foreign exchange risk on all foreign debt contracted in
the future.
The mechanism established under the Protocole d'Accord adequately
protects SOFIDE from bearing the foreign exchange risk on its foreign
borrowings and to date it worked well.

Annex 6
SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (SOFIDE)
INVESTMENT STRATEGY STATEMENT
Criteria for Selection of Projects by SOFIDE
Selection of projects shall taken into account economic
conditions, the major problems facing the country and national priorities,
while also bearing in wind the limited resources at SOFIDE's disposal.
In view of the particular difficulties facing Zaire and the
establishment of a floating exchange rate system, SOFIDE shall give
priority to projects meeting the following criteria:
(a) improvement of the balance of payments;
(b) satisfaction of basic needs;
(c) rehabilitation and modernization of industrial
enterprises;
(d) increased exploitation of local raw materials;
(e) employment creation; and
(f) improvement of transport conditions in the interior.
Specifically, SOFIDE shall assist the following projects:
- export-oriented projects;
- rehabilitation and modernization projects;
- projects using local raw materials;
- labor-intensive projects;
- commercial agriculture and forestry projects; and
- transport projects.
The above areas of activity constitute the criteria for the
pre-selection of projects. Appraisal of all projects will then include an
economic analysis, on the basis of which the decision to finance any given
project will be taken. Among the projects meeting the above criteria,
SOFIDE will select for its financing those with the highest economic rates
of return.

above mentioned sectors;
(b) Government to strengthen its capacity to formulate and
implement strategy and policy towards the industrial
and agro-industrial sectors;
(c) analysis of the measures (fiscal, trade related and
other) that would improve existing capacity utilization
in the above sectors; and
