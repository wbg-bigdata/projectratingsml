MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RErONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A TREE CROP PROCESSING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$118.2 million equivalent is submitted for
approval.  The froposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years'
grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and would assist the Government
of Indonesia's efforts to improve the efficiency of rubber and palm oil
*        processing and increase capacity to process output now arising from earlier
smallholder and estate plantings.
2.        Background.  Agriculture remains a key sector of the Indonesian
economy, contributing about one-fourth of GDP and providing employment to 55%
of the labor force. The sector has an important role in trade, contributing
41% of the value of non-oil/natural gas exports. Since 1969, agricultural
growth has averaged about 4Z p.a. and has outpaced population growth by a
significant margin. This impressive performance can be attributed to:
(a) sound macro-economic management through a responsive and flexible exchange
rate policy combined with prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (b) successful
rice intensification programs; and (c) an increased focus on tree crop
development as a major economic activity in the Outer Islands.
3.        The major tree crops (rubber, oil palm and coconuts) together occupy
about 5.5 million ha, or bver 20% of the cropped area in Indonesia. They
provide employment and cash income for some 15% of the agricultural labor
force, account for 16% of agricultural GDP and 20% of non-oil/natural gas
export earnings, and are a base of growing importance for the development of
related processing and manufacturing industries.  Smallholders predominate in
the cultivation of rubber and coconuts, and oil palm is largely grown on
public and private estates, although smallholder production is increasing.
4.        Tree crops are important in the economy of the Outer Islands where
growth in the labor force is hi;h and significant poverty exists, non-
agricultural activities are limited, and there are virtually no cash crop
alternatives that can be developed efficiently on an environmentally sustain-
.       able basis and on a large enough scale to have a major impact.  At current and
projected commodity prices, production of rubber and palm oil is economically
viable, and competitive, reflecting Indonesia's favorable agroclimatic condi-
tions and low average wage rates. Moreover, compared to other sectors of the
economy, such as manufacturing, tree crop development is a more cost-effective
means of generating employment and raising rural incomes in the Outer
Islands: the cost per job created in tree crops is US$3-4,000 compared to an
estimated US$10-20,000 per job in industry. During the Third Five Year Plan
(Repelita III; 1979-84) some 540,000 ha of rubber, oil palm and coconuts were
planted or replanted under Government programs, creating approximately one
million jobs, equivalent to almost 20% of all new jobs in the Outer Islands
during the period. A further 500,000-600,000 ha are being planted during



- 2 -
Repelita IV (1984-89). These planting programs have so far directly benefited
some 400,000 smallholder families (or about 2,000,000 people), up to 80% of
whom were landless transmigrants from the target poverty group in Java and
Bali and from areas surrounding project sites in the Outer lslands.
5.        The current restrained outlook for petroleum revenues ha3 reinforced
the importance of tree crops in contributing to balanced regional development
and poverty alleviation, and to growth in employment and non-oil/natural gas
export earnings. To take full advantage of technical and economic efficiency
of tree crop development in the Outer Islands and the favorable domestic and
export market prospects, Government has to address two major challenges.
First, to protect past investments, existing trees must be properly maintained
and harvested; and the raw material from those trees efficiently processed.
Second, to promote future planting in tree crops, financial, managerial and
institutional issues which have constrained the tree crop planting program in
the past need to be resolved.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has committed about 13$800
million net of loan cancellations to eleven tree crop projects, averaging more
than one project per year during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Due in part
to implementation problems in existing projects, planting targets were scaled
down for Repelita IV and only one Bank-assisted tree crop project has been
approved since 1983. The Indonesia Major Tree Crop Sector Report (No. 5318-
IND; April 1985) and the Indonesia Non-Oil Export Report (No. 6356-IND;
December 1986) both reasserted the importance of tree crops to Indonesia's
economic development, and endorsed Government's long-term strategy of using
tree crops as an effective means of promoting rural employment, non-oil
exports, and regional development. Through the recently approved Tree Crops
Human Resource Development Project, the Bank will assist Goverment in
strengthening the Department of Agriculture's Directorate General of Estates
(DGE). The proposed project would complement the Bank's past and ongoing
support for the tree crop subsector by ensuring that the produce of earlier
investments in the subsector is processed and marketed efficiently. Because
of its world-wide experience in the subsector, Bank support for the proposed
project would also assist in addressing technical, environmental,
institutional and marketing constraints on the efficiency of the processing
sector as a whole.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project would aim to raise the efficiency
of the tree crop subsector, increase smallholder and estate incomes, promote
regional development and increase non-oil exports by: (a) building new
factory capacity to process the raw material from existing nucleus escate and
smallholder tree crop projects; (b) providing technical assistance and other
support to improve processing efficiency, and (c) strengthening the ability of
DGE and related Government agencies (including those concerned with
environmental protection) to provide technical, institutional, marketing and
other support to the tree crop subsector, through technical assistance,
training and studies.
8.        Project Description.  The project's factory component would
construct or expand 11 rubber and 14 palm oil factories, including effluent
control facilities, for existing nucleus estate and smallholder projects in
the Outer Islands without access to existing factories. It would also train



- 3 -
PTP personnel in factory management and operations and provide technical
assistance to the PTPs. All factories would be completed by 1992/93. The
project's support component would train DGE and related agency personnel
concerned vith tree crop processing, particularly for project monitoring and
evaluation; support technical studies to develop and recommend more efficient
processing methods and studies on rubber marketing and long-term tree crop
processing needs; provide start-up funds for preparing future tree crop
projects and introducing advanced tree crop processing technology: and promote
compliance with Government environmental regulations by strengthening
provincial pollution monitoring units and developing action plans to improve
the quality of effluent treatment in existing PTP factories. DGE would have
overall coordinating responsibility for the project and specific responsibil-
ity for the support component. Implementation of the factory component would
be the reaponsibility of 12 PTPs who would own and operate the factories.
9.        The total financing required is estimated to be US$239.0 million
equivalent, including taxes and duties of US$13.9 million and interest during
construction of US$58.6 million. Foreign exchange requirements are estimated
at US$120.1 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$118.2 million equivalent,
49Z of financing requirements, covers US$109 million of the costs of the
factory component and US$9.2 million of the support component. Finance for
the support component would also be provided by Japanese Grant Facility funds
(US$1.8 million). Disbursements would be made against contracts, except for
in-house PTP training (US$3.4 million), and miscellaneous purchases of goods
and services costing less than US$50,000 each which would be disbursed against
statements of expenditure (US$3.0 million). Retroactive financing of up to
US$3.0 million for expenditures after November 1, 1987, will be provided for
start-up activities, particularly those related to factory engineering design
and site preparation. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of US$3 million is included under the
project. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement categories and
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6949-IND, dated September 19, 1988, is being distributed separately.
10.       Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, the following items were reviewed
and agreed: (a) draft financing documents, including Financing Agreements,
Subsidiary Loan Agreements, and Credit Agreements; and (b) detailed formulas
to be used by the PTPs for determining the price paid for smallholder rubber
and oil palm products. The following assurances were also obtained at
negotiations: (a) Government would prepare by June 30, 1989 for each project
PTP an action plan satisfactory to the Bank to address financial and othei
issues; (b) Government would submit to the Bank an action plan by December 31,
1990 to bring existing PTP factories into compliance with environmental regu-
lations; and (c) Government would select and train, for each project PTP, the
relevant factory senior staff and would appoint such persons at least six
months prior to the estimated commissioning date of the relevant factory.
Conditions of loan disbursement are: (a) for each PTP, PTP technical
assistance consultants to be in post; (b) submission of final signed financing
documents for the relevant factory; and (c) for the five PTPs constructing the
first six palm oil factories, commencement of implementation of a preliminary
action plan to address any managerial, financial, and technical issues



-4-
affecting the performance of the relevant PTP.
11.       Benefits. The proposed project would increase smallholder and estate
incomes, )romote economically sound regional development and increase non-
petroleum exports by providing environmentally sound new processing facilities
and increasing efficiency in existing facilities. About 60,000 smallholder
families are expected to benefit from the factories provided by this project
which would all be located in the Outer Islands. At full pr'duction, annual
incremental production from project factories would be about 70,000 tons of
rubber, 340,000 tons of crude palm oil and 73,000 tons of palm kernel, with a
total FOB value of US$175 million. The project would ensure that rubber and
palm oil produced as a result of earlier investments (some in Bank financed
Nucleus Estate and Smallholder projects and all including smallholder
production) are efficiently processed. Improvements in factory operating
efficiency built into the design of these factories and the project's tech-
nical assistance and training components are estimated to increase smallholder
and PTP incomes up to 15Z-252 over the average in existing factories. Through
the project's support component, improvements would be made in environmental
protection, the monitoring and evaluation capability of the Directorate
General of Estates, and tree crop processing technology. The economic rates
of return on the factories range from 18%-130Z, with a weighted average of
61%.
12.       Risks.  The primary project risk is a potential loss of beaefits
resulting from delays in project implementation and meeting the project's
capacity and efficiency objectives due to institutional weaknesses. Project
management arrangements and technical assistance have been designed to
minimize this risk.  In addition, key start-up vtivities related to
procurement, financing arrangements and technical assistance have been
advanced during project preparation. The ultimate success will depend on
whether the proposed measures will be successful in strengthening institutions
and PTPs' management.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
