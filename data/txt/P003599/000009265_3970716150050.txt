EXECUTIVESUMMRY
1. Introduction
Yunnan Province is located in the south west of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and is bordered to
the nordh by Sichuan Province. to the east by Guizhou and Guangi Provinces and to the south and west
by Vietnam. Laos and Mvanmar I Figure 1). The province has a total [and area of 394.000 km2 and a
population of 38 million. * hich is largely nuraL some 81% being involved in agriculture. The provincl
capital and major industnal centre. Kunming. is by far the largest city (population 1.8 million) and
dominates the cconomy ot the province. The next lrgest cities, also significant industrial centes, are
Qujing and GCejiu. %siih populations of 220.000 and 130.000 respectively.
The north west ot- the province is dominated by the south astern Himalayas and incluces the sources of
three major rivers. the Jingshapiang twhich discharges to the Chanljiang (Yangtze)). the Lancangiang
(Mckong) and the Nu;.ang (Salweeni. The north east area includes the source of the Nanpanjiang (Parl
River). The south of the province ts tropical and the central and eastern areas comprise a plateau and
fertile lake basins al an elevation of about 2.OOOm.
Rapid economic erowth over the past 15 years has resulted in severe enviromuental degradation in and
around the three project cities and even in some rural areas. The environment in many areas in the
province is under severe stress. The principal cause of degradation of the water environment in wuban
areas is the lack of effective control of polluting discharges to watercourses.  The situWon is
exacerbated by the substantial underpricing of water and cnvironmental services such as wastewater
disposal which leads to v%asteful consumption and hence pressure on scarce water resources.
This is particularlv the case in the Lake Dianchi Basin. which includes Kunming. where water resous
are particurly lmited and are thweatened in tersm both of water quality and quantity. Lake Dimchi
receives discharges of municipal and indusrial wastewater fxn Kunming and its suburbs.   H ,wee,
the water resources of Lake Dianchi Basin are very limited. per capita run off being of the order of 5%
of the Yunnan and 3%'o of the world average As a consequence of the inadequate water resources for
Kunming the lake provides up to 50%/o of the City's water supplies even in an average rainfill year.
Further increases in demand will result in even more reliance on. and recycling of, the like for supplies
of potable water at a time when its quality wil continue to decline if remedial interventions are not
implemented in time.
The repeated recvclinz of wastewater has resulted in substantial increases m the loads of nutrints,
principally phosphorus and nitrogen'. discharged to the lakce. Te sitlation is exacrbated by the
presence of a number of phospherus and nitrogen-based fertiliser factories in the basin. exploiting the
extensive local phosphate-bascd mineral resources. lbe lake receives discharges of nutrient-rich
wastewater from these factones and also run-off from agricultural areas in its catchmenL As a result of
the high nutrient loads Lake Dianchi is already in an advanced state of cutrophication which is
manifestLd in part in increasing problems in potable water teatnent in Kunming.
Growth in the other urban centres of Yunnan. principally Qujing and Gejiu. coupled with inadequate
control of polluting discharges. is causing similar problems of water quality and pressure on limited
water resources. A major environmental ma.er plan study for the Dianchi Basin. Qujing and G3jiu,
funded by the UK Overseas Development Administation (ODA) is due for completion in 1996. This
study has identified a set of major priority investments aimed at rehabilitation of water quality,
principally in Lak-e Dianchi. and improving the effectiveness of water resource utilisation and dte
management of solid and liquid wastes.

Execuive Swmar
In order to address the above conccrns the Yunnan Enviromnental Project (YEP) would focus on
improving the state of the environmenL principally in terms of water quality, via a range of investments
with the objectives of
*     improving water qualitv. mainiv in Lake Dianchi. and water resources management to allow
sustained safe beneticial use:
*     improving standards of municipal wastes management
*     institution of mcasures to strengthen control of industrial pollution and to improve water and
matenals utilisation:
*     enhancing lacilities for the effective monitoring of enviromnental qualitv in Yunnan: and
*     strengthening of policies and institutional arrangements for water quality managemcnt; water
ard %asevuater facilitics operations, environental regulation and rmanagemnent training.
Technical support and trainine u ould be provided to utility and environment sector agencics in Yunnan
at provincial and municipal levels, including enviromnctnal protection bureaux (EPBs) and monhoring
centres IEMCs. municipal utilitv operations and finance departunents.
'. Administrative and Institutional Ftmmework
The State Environmental Protection Committee is the highest level of authoritv on environmental policy
and includes the State Council and heads of all relevant ministries and agencies- The national
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) functions as the secretariat of SEPC and is responsible for all
aspects of environmental policy although shares authority with other agencies for certain namal
resources.. NEPA sets overall policies and rcgulations govening the provincial and municipal
environmental protection bureaux (EPBs) and implementation of environmental policv is though the
municipal and provincial EPBs. who are responsible for the maintenance of environmental quality.
Specific responsibilitv for water resources in Yunnan lies with the Ynuman Water Conservancy Bueau,
and with Kumning Water Conservancv Bureau for the resoures of Lake Dianchi Basin. Maintnance of
water qualitv is the responsibility of the Yunnan EPB and that in Lake Dianchi Basin of the Kmunming
and other municipal EPBs. These bureaux monitor environental quality, set envinmental and
discharge standards. assess and levv pollution charges and prosecute serious polluters.
3. Project Description
The proposed YEP compnses a total of 30 components. of which The World Bank is proposing to fund
21 as shown in Table I.

4. Basdine Data
4.1 General
Yunnan is among the poorest provinces in the PRC with a per capita income of V3253 (1993).
approxmately 496% ol the national average. Relative to the PRC as a whole, the economy of Yunnan is
dominated by pnmarv production. principally agricultune, with manufacturing accounting for a relatively
smaller proponion ot output. Kunming is a substantial industrial centr  dominating the provincal
economy. and has a per capita GDP of Y 10.200. Tlere is evidence of a shift towards tertiary sector
activities in recent sears.
An importnt teature ot industrv in both Yunnan and Kunning is the dominance of State Owned
Enterpises (SOEs). pnncipaliv at Provincial and Municipal level. These account for about 75% of gross
output compared dith a corresponding figure of 43% for the PRC as a whole. This is an important
factor in environmental terms. because many are loss making. in some cases. such as fertiliser
production. as a consequence of Central Government controls on output prices. As a result many appear
to be unable to fund pollution control measues.
Qujing is the second largest citv in Yunnan. with a population of 220.000. and is located some 156Cm to
the north east of Kunming. Industrv has expanded rapidly in recent years and Qujing is one of dte six
cities in Yunnan designated for high short tenr economic and population growth (the populatio is
expected to more than double by 2010. Industrial activity is based on cigarette production. non-fenus
metallurgv, chemicals and automobile manufacture Qujing is well located on the road and rail networks
for ready access both to Kunming and to other provinces.
Gejin is located to the south of Kunming in a mounaino ara in the southemmost part of Yun_
T'he city has grown largely around the development of the tin mining and processing industies Tih
population of Gejiu city is currentlv 133.000. with a further 80.000 in four satellite towns which house
most of the major industnes.
4.2 Cimate
Yunnan has a northern sub-tropical monsoon climate, with extremes of tempemture modeated by
altiude and latitude. Precipitation is plentifil (averag  I 1OOmn/yr) and the province as a whole is
relatively water rich. with per capita run-off approaching 21 times the National average. However,
regional differences in the balance between rainfall and evaporation and substantial temporal variability
in rainfall result in areas with verv limited water resouces. Lake Dianchi Basin. Qujing and Gejiu are
such amas

capita. but as a result of population growth this will fall in 2020 to 200m3 onaverage and as low as 90m'
in a dmuet vear. The latter would barely be sufficient to support domestic water demand alone.
At present water demands (agricultural. industrial and domestic) in Lake Dianchi Basin exceed supply
by between 177 million m/IT and 578 million m3/yr in average and dry (20 %ile) years respectively.
This suppiv imbalance is corrected by recvcling of water. mainly the dischages of unmtreated wastwater
from Kunming to Lake Dianchi.
Wide tenporal -anations in annual rainfall dictate that water supply depcnds heavily upon reservoir
storage. The pnncipal suppiv source for Kunming is the Songhuaba Reservoir. which has the dual roles
of water supply and tlood protection. The mean annual run off and total storage volume of Songhuaba
Reservoir are 1'4 million m; and 229 million im" respectively. However, because of flood control
requirements (I In 100 year tlood). the effective storage available for water supply is only 110 million
In'. which gives a mean annual vield of 128 million m' (350 000 m3/d) with an assurance rate of 95%Y. In
practice the reservoir is operated at a level I Sm below the operating rule curve because famners have not
received compensation pavments for the loss of land involved.
The reservoir currently supplies water for agricultunal as well as municipal use. It is proposed in fiure
to substitute Lake Dianchi water for use in agriculture to conserve the better qualitv Songhuaba watr for
potable supply.
The majoritv of the water demand in Kunming is met by abstractions from Lake Dianchi. amounting to
480.000 m3id. Lake Dianchi has an average depth of approximately 4.5m and the overall ste
volume is 1.250 million m'. iowever, the eff ctive storage is substantially less than this figur because
of the flood control requirenents. The lake receives run off from approximately 20 river Tho

reduced in the drv season to little more than semi-stagnant. open sewers. A majority of rivers entr the
lake from agricultural areas to the east and south of the bke These when they flow (usually less than 50
days per year) are relatively clean
Flood protection is achieved by the discharge of water from the lake via the sole outlet at Haikou, at the
south west of the lake. to the Tanglangchuan river. The bydraulic capacity of the T  is
limited, and a further flood alleviation measure the Xiyun Tunnel at the north east ofthe lake, has been
constuted to increase the rate of discharg of flood water. In spite of these and other measures aimed
at increasing the effective storage in Lake Dianchi. the increased water demands are such that they can
only be met bv ever increasing recycling of Kunmning municipal wastewater or by the costly alteative
of importing water from another catchment.
4.3.2 Qujing
The principal watercourse in Qujing Municipality is the Nanpanjiang which provides the majority ofthe
water supply to Qujing via three reservoirs on its tributaries. 'Me remainder is obtained fiom
groundwater. These resources are insufficient to meet future demands. for which it will be necessary to
transport water from Du Mu Reservoir. located some 45km east ofthe city.
4.33 Gejiu
Gejiu derives water supplies from a cornbination of three reservoirs to the south of the city and fioin
groundwater and springs. Most of the city's industrv is supplied from Gejiu Lake. an artificial lake
constructed in 1955 with a volume of 5 million m' largey for flood protection and amenity use. The
lake has for manv years received discharges of urban was_twatcr. soil eroded from mining areas above
the city and tailings from tin processing. As a result thee has been a substantial reduction in its
effective volume and self purification capacity. Betwecn 1961 and 1986 sediments were dredged firom
dhe lake and maintained a reasonable storage capacity. This is no longer happeing.

4.42 Dianchi Basin
The principal ecographical features of the Lake Dianchi Basin are shown in Figure 2.
Songhnaba Reservoir: %ater qualitv in is currendy classified as Class [L but the limited data available
indicate increasing nutment concentrations in the reservoir and hence progessive eutrophicad
Although the reservoir catchinent was designaLed a Water Protction Zone in 1981 the contituing lack
of practical control has resulted in increasing farming and nual township expansion in the proteci
Zone.
Lake Dianchi: is divided into two parts. the Caohai (inner lae. 2.5% of Dianchi by area less dtan 1%
by volume) and the much larger Waihai (outer lake 97.5%). The Caohai and the Waihai are now
physically separated by a recentlv completed banage fitted with control gates Municipal and indsrial
wastewater from Kunming is discharged, mainly untreated, into both the Caohai and Walhio Each
receives about 50%/o of the effluent with particularly dire consequences for the Caohai. For flood control
purposes water from the Caohai can be discharge though dther the control gates to the Waihai or via
the Xiyuan Tunnel to the Tanglangchuan catclunent
Kunming STWs: There is currently only one operational wa_twr treanent works in Kunmin&
txating a flow of 55.000m'/d. which discharges ultnately to the Caohai. A firther 3 factories are under
constuction. with a total tratment capacity of 360,000 m'id of which 210,000 m'3d will be dichaged
to the Waihai. In all cases the STWs-will treat a combination of effluent. stonmwater and river water
until the construction of separate drainage systems is completed under YEP. Treatment processes at al
wastewater treatment works incorporate paTial removal of both nitogen and phosphorus. The
detrimental impacts of wastewater dilution by storwatmer on P and N removal efficiency should be
noted.
As noted above the Caohai is particularly polluted. with water quality failing to comply even with Class
V standards. In particular the concentrions of nitogen and phosphorus are high, typically up to 7.5
and 0.9mg/I respecively. Contamination with toxic matter is aLw of concrnL Water quality in the
Waihai has also deteriorated in rcent years. and nirogen and phosphorus concentations are again high,
averaging 1.5 and 0,14 mg/l respectively in 1995.

Exeutve Suunsr
Water is abstracted from the Waihai for trtment at two water treatenet works. However. poor water
quality in terns of aleal growths resulting firom the high nutrient concenwrations are causing severe
treatment difficulties. In panticular. one water intake close to the buundary with the Caohai has been
closed.
Phosphorus: has been 3dentified as the growth-limiting nutrient and therefore the principal focus of load
reduction in wastc%atcr trcatment. A summarv of the potential phosphorus loads to both the Caohat and
Waihai are shown in rabic 4.

It may be seen from Table 4 that the loads are in both cases dominated by point source discharges of
urban and industnal %astewater. Discharges to the Caohai have in the past entered the Wkiha, and
therefore the load to the Waihai would have been greater than that indicated in Table 4. Hoever, the
construction of the barrage and the Xiyuan tunnel has now allowed the diversion in dry weather of water
from the Caohai. pnncipaliv urban wastewater. away from the Waihai to the downstram Tanglng-
chuan river.
In addition to the high nutrient levels in both the Caohai and the Wathai there is concern also at
discharges of oreanic matter (BOC/COD) from municipal wastewater and toxins from industry. High
BOD/COD can result in deoxygenated water and the rec-se of nutrients from sediments causing further
algal growth: and toxins mav reduce the lakes self-cleansing capacity and contaminate aquatic food
chains.
The Tanglanochuan River: receives water discharged from the Waihai at Haikou throughout the year,
either for flood control purposes or to maintain a base flow in the dry season. There is considerable
exploitation of the Taniglangchuan for irrigaed agriculture and by industry. Waste quality in the
Tanglangchuan is poor as a result of discharges of untreated industrial wastewater. Dianchi water is
wastefuliv dischareed from Lake Dianchi simply to provide dilution of this illegal pollution to maintain
even the present level of water quality.

4.4.3 Qujing
Water quality in the service reservoirs and the Nanpanjiang tributaries above Qujing are generally of
good qualitv. typically meeting Class I standard. The Nanpanjiang below the Huashan Reservoir (some
40 km upstream ot' ujine) is also Class I but industries (fertiliser factories and a paper mill) reduce the
qualitv to Class V principallv in terms of high COD and ammonia concentrations. Addition of furdthr
effluents from Qujing does not influence this classification. At the Xianghuiba Reservoir. 45km
downstream of Ouiing the Nanpanjiane has improved to Class III. The stated objective is to improve
water qualitv ol the >.anpanilane in the vicinity of Qujing to Class IV by 2000 and to Class III by 2010.
4.4.4 Gejiu
Gejiu Lake has been senouslv polluted bv long-term discharges of municipal and industrial wastewaer,
with water qualirm tadling to meet even Class V standards. Even during cooler months quiescent areas
appear black and scptic. Sediments are highly contaminated with metals (arsenic, lead and cadmium)
discharged from tin mining and related activities. although there have been dramatic reductions in taxic
metal discharees over the past 20 vears. The objective for Lake Gejiu is to improve water quality to
Class IV. suft-icicnt to support industnal water use and recreation.
4.5 The Causes of Environmental Degradation in Yunnan
The principal underl% ing cause of the deteriorating water quality in the Dianchi Basin and the other
project cities is the % inual absence of effective implementation of existing discharge regulations which
allows uncontrolled dischamte of wastewater (without treaument), from urban and industrial sources The
primary instrument in the PRC for control of industrial pollution is the effluent fee sysm, but the fes
charged are considcrably below levels necessary to have the required incentive effect in terms of
wastewater treatment. Moreover. there is only partial collection of fees. particularly in Kunming, where
the collection rate is onlv oft the order of 400/%. Polluters are not paying for the use of envirmnental
services and these services are suffering accordingly.
4-51 Lake Dianchi: Ecological Degradstion
In the early 1950s. Lak-e Dianchi was classified as an oligo- to mesotrophic clear water lake. Sediments
were largelv covered by macrophytes. The fish communitv consisted mainly of indigenous species and
zooplankton were sutficiecn to suppress algal growth. The sloping shores resulted in different zones of
littoral macrophvte communities that contributed fish breeding sites and to lake cleansing and a large
biodiversitv.
Increased human activitv in the 1960s and 1970s led to domestic and industrial pollution. land abuse,
erosion processes. land reclamation of critical shoreline areas, over fishing and introduction of exotic
edible fish species. As a resulL the lake ecosysten changed into a turbid waterbody. the fish community
became dominated by carps. and the algae by blue-green types Avemge chlorophyil-a values increased
to 120-150 g/I for the Caohai and 20-50 gto in the Waihai. The area of the Caohai has been reduced
from 12 to 8 kImn lor urban land reclamation. faohai sediments have been heavily polluted, especialy
with industrial heavv metals.
Macmphyte coverace has reduced drastically: today there are almost no submnersed macrophytes at all.
Only in a few w estem parts of the Waihai is macrophyte coverage adequate for fish to spawn and grow.
The inner Caohai is often choked bv water hyacinth, closing off large parts of the water column from
light and oxvyen. Clearini of the hvacinth imposes financial burdens on the City and lake users, and
reduces the lakles tounsm potential.
Water qualitv degradation has resulted from a combination of pbysical. chemical and biological
interventions by man over the past few decades. The reasons, causes and consequences of these
interventions are summarised in Table 5 and their interactions illustrated in Figure 3.

&Easw&miy
An important conclusion io be dracwn from an analysis of the causes and consequences of water
qualitv deteriorat(on in Lake Dianchi is that treaong the sources of pollution. will. alone. be
insufficient to return the lake to uis once pristine condition. But such interventions are likely to relard
or reverse the do)wnwwrd trend as is shown in Section 6.1.
To understand the reasons for the deterioration of lake water quality in Lake Dianchi it is necessary to
appreciate the sieniticance and maznitude of the human interventions which have occurred in the
basin during Ihe laIt two or three decades and the environmental impacts they have had. These are
d-scussed in the section 4 6 and itemised below:
* the expansitn *ot the urban population and industrv in the basin.
* the reclamation ot lakeside land and floodplain areas for urban and agricultural use.
* construction ol the lake perimeter dykes.
* the ever increasing human control and intervention in the natural water cycle.
* deforestation lor fuelling steel production and problems of forestry management control and land
allocation.
4.6 Dianchi Basin Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecology
Fish species diversitv in Lake Dianchi declined between the late 1950s and 1985 from 53 to 27 as a
result of protectt e d% ke construction and land reclamation. These activities destroyed the shallow water
areas where t'ish uould normally breed and have nursery grounds. Of the surviving 27 species only 6 are
now of commerctal importance, but the total annual yield has declined much less dramatically dtan
species numbers. Like Dianchi remains the largest fish producer in Yunnan.
The dvke construction and land reclamation activities have contributed to the degradation of Lake
Dianchi in respect of midespread destruction of its littoral zone and of aquatic macrophytes. In addition
deforestation contributed to the phosphorus loading to the lake as a result of soil erosion. which has also
reduced the lake volume. The problems of Lake Dianchi dtrefom derive both fron the increase in the
loads of phosphorus to the lake and from the reduction in its ability to assimilate phosphorus as a result
of the disruption of its natural ecology.
Approximatelv 22% of Lake Dianchi Basin is occupied by cropped land and about 37P/ by forests. The
forsts consist pnncipallv of sub-tropical evergreen broad leafed species but also include areas of
deciduous broad leaved forest, temperate pine forest, shrub grassland. bamboo forest and grassland.
Eucalyptus globudes has been introduced as a plantation species and occurs throughout the basin
There has been considerable degradation of the forest as a result of use of wood as a fuel and of
problerns of forcst management control and land allocation. Nevertheless the proportion of the basin
area accounted for by torest cover remains the same as that in 1975.
4.7 Solid Waste Management
Overall responsibilitv for the collection and disposal of municipal and commercial wastes and saet
sweepings rests with the CitV Appearance Committe (CACs) and the Munict;i: Environmenta
Sanitation Sections (MESSs). Collecton of solid wastes is gencraliv effective. although in some areas
unsightly large quantifies of waste line roadsides and river banks. where it is left to decornpose for
subsequent use as compost.
Disposal of solid wastes has traditionally been to land. principally to numerous large and small open
dumps. and not using acceptable standards of sanitarv laiidfill. Two major sites serving Kunming have
received more than 2 million tonnes over the past 10 yea. T'he open dumps are unhygienic and
unsatisfactorv and are not registered or monitored. Since the dumps are neither lined nor covered. there
are potenial problems of leachate and wind bknln pollution. Ther is also particular concern over the
uncontrolled disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes from industy and hospitals.

Quantities of' municipal solid waste on a per capia basis are declining as a rcsult of the change fiom
coal to gas as a fuel. As a result the organic content is higher. There are informal recycling activities.
but the proportion of waste recvcled is high but quantitatively unknown. The decline in the use of
nightsoil bv farmers in favour of chemical fertilisers has resulted in the disposal of increasing quantities
of nightsoil with the solid -6aste stream. Dewatered sludges fiom the existing Kumnning STI and all
planned works %ill be disposed of to the sanitary landfill sites proposed under the YEP.
S. Consideration of Alternatives
The Yunnan lFriironmental Project is an umbrella programme comprising 19 sub-projects which
together will beemn to tackle the uorsening problems of environmental degradation being faced in
Yunnan. This secetion discusses the consideration of alternatives in the development of the overall
YEP and in the  lecction ot individual sub-projects for inclusion in the World Bank Funding.
5.1 Project Selection
The initial ranking and selection process for inclusion under World Bank funding was based on the
six followine critena:
I. Objective: that the project will achieve the strategic objectives of the YEP and, where relevant,
those of the Dianchi Basin Action Plan. or the equivalent plans for Qujing and Gejiu.
2. Lake: achieves the objective of cleaning up Lake Dianchi. or the Nanpanjiang. or Lake Gejiu,
3. ImWlementarinzn case with which the project can be implemented by the agency responsible.
4. Value: that the projcct represents good value for money, and is the least cost alternative,
5. Rea,y- readiness of the project for design,
6. Bankable: the project is acceptable to the World Bank and other Funding Agencies: this criterion
includes the ability ot the implementing agency to repay the loan.
Those projects with the highest scores were included for World Bank fimding up to the point where
the total cost of the selected projects exceeded the funding available.
5.2 Project Design Alternatves
The majoritv of decisions where alternative design options were available concerned proposed hard-
ware interventions. i.e. those where construction is involved.
For construction interventions, the following options were considered:
* Appropriate rechnoloRy: appropriate for the task in hand. also appropriate for China in terms of
local availability. sophistication. operations and maintenance support;
* Choice of capacifr: treatment capacity at WTWs and STWs particularly-,
* Phasing of sab-projects: choice of order in which sub-projects will be implemented;
* Phksing of expansion within sub-projec: WTWs and STWs and their networks can be
proessively expanded as demand for their services increases with population and economic
growth:
* Site selection: vhere alternative sites are available. and availability is often scarce. the choicc is
for the least cost and m inimal environmental and social impacts.
* M-minimsarioj oJ environmental inpacts including LAR issues: usually resulting from site
selection.
- Proces options within a workss: choice of degree of flexibility in factory operations, the ability to
by-pass process when operating conditions permit, to reduce costs. or varying chemicals used,
* Mtgation opnons: assessing and selecting the best means of mitigating adverse impacts.

Executve Siway
In most cases the approaches adopted for the various project components represent the only realistic
option in terms of resource availabilitv or achievement of the required environmetal objective. Where
multiple options were available the least cost solution achieving the required objective was selected.
In terns oi the rehabilitation of Lakc Dianchi with respect to its trophic state it would not be possible
within a realistic time-tramc to enhance sufficiently the ability of the lake to assimilate phosphorus. The
only realistic approach to improving or maintaining present water quality in the immediate temm is
therefore to reduce the phosphorus loads discharged to the lake and aim to maintain the satw qua.
Achievine this aim inr the Waihai is the prime concern.
Tlhe proposed Kunmine % astewater treatment works processes are based on biological tratment
incorporating ntmroren and phosphorus removal in addition to achieving a high degree of removal of
organic matter fie alternative of a totallv chemically based treatment svstem would not readily be able
to achieve all the discharge standards. particularly in respect of removal of nitrogen and organic matter.
Further removal *ot nutnents from the Waihai by diversion of treated wastewater to the Caobai and
thence via the Xi%.uan tunnel was rejected in view of water resource limitations on the Waihai.
Chemical treatment was, however. preferred to a high rate biological treatment system as an
intermediate solution in both Qujing and Gejiu. The chemical treatment system adopted offers both cost
and operational advantages and can readily be incorporated into the biological treatment system
proposed for the longer termn
Sanitarv landfill %%as preferred to other waste disposal options in all cases. Incineration would not be
appropriate in .iew of the low heat value of the wastes. resulting from either a high inert ash content.
arising from domcstic usc of coal as a tuel, or from a high moisture content Composting was rejected in
view of concerns over adequacy and stability of product market outlets. Moreover, landfill would be
required in any event lor reject materials from other options.
6. Environmental Benefits
The balace of the YEP including the Worl Bazkfwded componnts is subzzt idy positve, and iue
are considerable environmental benefits for Lake DiAncir Basin andfor the cities of Qfjmg and Gejit
TMere will be some adverse impacts during project implementation but these are minor comparcd to the
potentially disastrous impacts of not implementing the YEP. The 'Do Nothing Scenario' is not a viable
option. Principal project benefits are discussed in detail below. Adverse impacts and iTwitigation
measures are discussed in Section 7.
6.1 Lake Dianchi Basin
Two project intervention categories. STWs (urban and rual), and IPC will have direct benefits for
water quality in Lake Dianchi. Other components. WTWs and Solid Waste Managemnct, for
example, will not directly improve lake water quality but will have significant social and
environmentl benefits in other ways.
The primary focus of the wastewater treatment works and industrial pollution control projects is the
reduction of the point source loads of nutrients. principally phosphorus. to Lake Dianchi. particularly
the Waihai.
An assessment of the anticipated overall P removal benefits of from implementation of the Dianchi
Basin projects is summarised in Table 6. The loads referred to in the table relate to conditions obtaining
in the year 2010. the time horizon of the designs for all project components.

phosphorus load by 60 to 80%. depending upon initial phosphorus concnrations which are a function
of the relative contnbution of industrial wastewater and stormwater volume. Removal of organic mattnr
from wastewater will be in the order of 900Me.
In addition the associated seweraee network will collect urban wastewater that currently discharges
untreated to the rivers that traverse Kunming with the great advantage that the STWs will treat effluent
only and not ri er ,ater As a result there will be a substantial improvement in water quality in these
rivers improving both aethetic and possiblv public health conditions.
6.1.2 Rural Tori nships Sewerage
Wastewater tre2tment tir the rural totwnships of Chenggong and Jinning would also be based on
biological treatmcmn ncludint removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The treatrnent proposed will reduce
the phosphorus loads to the Waihai from these sources by in the order of 75%.
6.13 Industrial Pollution Control
The pollution control proposals for the two fertiliser factories. the Kunyang Phosphorus Fertiliser and
the Kunmine Clhemical Fertiliser Factories are based on a combination of process upgrading, watr
conservation and wastewater treatment. The phosphorus load fromn the forToer factory will be reduced
by 56 ttyT (98%) and the nitrozen and phosphorus loads from the atter by 470t/vr (85%/) and 32 tyr
(87/o) respectivelv nie combined load removals will reduce the phosphorus load to the Waia by
90%10.
It will be seen from rable h that the prospective phosphorus loads that would be generated in 2010
preusent a verv substantial increase, some 40% over the 1995 case. The increase is principaily ds a
result of population erowth and increased living standards. including the progressive abandomnent of the
nightsoil svstem.
The existing and proposed interventions (principally wastewater treatment works Nos 2 and 4a, the
fonner constructed with assistance from bilateal funding) could potentially achieve a significmt
reduction in phosphorus load. However. their effectiveness is to some degree reduced by deficiencies in
sewerge systens which presently limit the proportion of the available wastewater collected for
treatment. TXhe values in Table 6 for the 2010 case witl the existing and proposed interventions assumes
that, until the sewerage system improvements are implemented. the treatment works will continue to
eat polluted water drawn trom the adjacent rivers. Thes rivers are in any event open sewers in the dry
season. and it has been assumed that 25% of the annual phosphorus load of the sewage drawn firm the
rivers will escape in storm water during the wet season.
The implemenmtion of the wastewater collection and treatment componems of the projec together with
the pollution control proposals for the two fertiliser factories. should reduce the 2010 phosphorus load
by about 50%. to a level some 23% below the 1995 case. Moreover, it is considered that this simple
evaluation based on total phosphorus undersates the potetial effectiveness of the proposals in two
respects.
This calculation is based on a residual phosphorus concentration in the treated wastewater of Img/Il the
Lake Dianchi dischargc standard. The wastewater treatment works design is based on achieving a
residual phosphorus concentration of not more than lmg/l at all times. and therefore the average
concentration w%ould be significantly lower than Imgll. Table 6 includes also an estimate of the
phosphorus load based on a rcsidual concentration in trcated wastewater of 0.5 mg/l which reduces the
total phosphorus load to the Waihai bv a further 53tIvr below the YEP I mg/I estimate.
In addition. much of the phosphorus associated with the non-joint sources is in the form of insoluble
particulates and theelfore not readily available for algal consumpSion. It has conservatively been
eated that 700o% wor 160 t/yr) of the phosphorus fmom non-point sources is insoluble, leaving an
available input of 91 tny to Lake Dianchi (of which 68tly goes to the Waihai).
DRAFT                            poge 17of 25                          09 Februay 1996



Exe _rite Sws=y
The corresponding reductions to the Caohai are shown also in Table 6. and a similar situation obtains in
respect of the need for sewerage system enhancement to ensue that the proposed vastewater treatment
works Nos I and 3 can be effective in reducing phosphorus loads. Again the implementation of the
project proposals is estimated to reduce the load of phosphorus to the Caohai to significantly below the
1995 case.
In view of these substanttal reductions in phosphorus load it would be expected that there would be a
significant reduction an phosphorus concentrations in the WaihaL. and thcefore a corresponding
reduction in the Later tre3tirent problems relative to those currently experienced. In practice the degree
and rate of recoverV 31ll to a certain cxtent be limited bv the reduced ability of the Waihai to assimilate
phosphorus as a consequence of the disruption of its natural ecology. More imporntly, however, the
substantial load reductions relative to the 2010 "do nothing" predictions would. in the presence of the
YEP intervcntions, prevent water qualitv declining to such levels that treatnent became highly
problematic. Sucth conditions would require very major changes to treatment processes or, in the
extreme case. the verv costlv substitution of Lake Dianchi water resources by import of water from other
camltments
6.14 Kunming Water Supply
The water supply and treatment componeu.ts will not of themselves have a direct benefit on water quality
in Lake Dianchi. The Water Resources Management component wilL however. permit a more optimal
use of the water resources in the basin in that it will increase the use of the higher quality water fom
Songhuaba Reservoir for domestic potmble supply with anticipated financial benefits of tratnent cost
reductions. Additionallv. the initiatives to reduce water demand by tariff and loss reductions, will reduce
pressure on supplies lcading to economnic and cnvirormental benefitL
6.1.5 Kunming Sanitarv Landfill
The two sanitary landfill sites proposed for Kunming will provide capacity for the environmentally
acceptable disposal of solid wastes from Kunmiing for up to 20 years, and thereby reduce the potential
impact on surface and groundwater from the presmt uncontrolled tipplDg of waste. There wil be
coreponding improvements in the efficiency of collection and transport, which will reduce the
environmental degradation and visual pollWion arising fiom unauthorised dumping of waste in urban
Two recent major eanhquakes in Yunnan have heightened feats of sinilar events affecting the Kumning
Landfill sites, one of which is bisected by a large fault Further geological surveys will re-assess the
situation but it must be realised that few areas around Kunming are free frm faults and therefore prone
to seismic activirvt The Do Nothing7 option is still deemed as the worst option even with the risk of an
eardthqake at the proposed sites.
6.1.6 Environmental Management and Monitoring
The principal benefits are in the enhanced ability to:
1. detect long-term trends in selected environmental parameters,
2. check effluent quality into and out of STWs to ensure compliance with local discharge standards,
3. undertake compliance testing for industries.
4. monitor YEP performance. is the environment improving as per expectations?
5. monitor qualit of potable water supplies and check waterworks chemical processing.

6.2.1 Water Supplv
The water supply component for Qujing will alleviate raw water shorges and incresc die assunc
rate. particularly in dr years when as little as only 60Yo of urban demand has been met Network
extensions wall increase the customer base and distribution of water in the city.
6.22 Wastewater Treatment
The wastewater treatment works. zith a capacity of lO0.OOOm3/d. provides only partial teatment in the
immediate term. Iased on chemically assisted primary sedimnentation. It will nevertheless remove a
substantial pollution l0ad. but the longer term water quality objectives for the Nanpanjiang will re
also control of industnal wasiewater.
6.23 Solid Waste Management
The  wastes manazement proposals will provide environmentally sound sanitary landfin disposal
facilities for wastes from Qujing and Zhanyi. replacing the existing largely uncontrolled dump sites
which are known to be polluting groundwater and causing odour problems over the city. The waste
collection improvements, including transfer stations. will enhance collection efficiency and reduce the
degree of flytipping.
6.3 Gejiu
The wastewater and flood protection proposals for Gejiu, in addition to imnproving the capacity to
discharge floodwater from Lake Gejiu. will collect wasewater currently discharged to the lake and
threbv reduce the pollution load that the lake presendy receives. The reated wastewater discharged to
the Zhadian nver coutside the Gcjiu catchment) will provide additional water for irrigation use. Higber
quality water will be supplied to the lae from the existig potable water sources in substition for fte
wastewater supplied for irrigation. This sbsttion will sustain both the water balance and watr
quality improvement in the lake.
7. Adverse Impacts and Mitigation Meiures
Notwithstanding the very substantial positive balance of environmental impact of the project, there are
nevertheless some adverse impacts that require mitigation. These impacts occur both in consruction
and operttional phases of the project components. The principal impacts and the proposed mitigitiou
measures are descnbed in detail below: a summary of impacts and mitigations is given in Table 7.
7.1 Land Acquisition
All YEP components requirm some land acquisition on either a temporary or pemanent basis (Table 8).
Thc total permanent land acquisition requirement is 225 ha. with 163 ha in Lake Dianchi Basin. 60 ba in
Qujing and 1 .8 ha in Gcjiu respectively. The areas of land to be pemanently acquired are dominated by
the landfill site requirements. which accoumt for 125 ha for Kunming, of which 67 ha for one site has
already becn acquired. and 46 ha for Qujing. Water and wastwatr treatment works account for the
balance of land required permanently.
The land acquired for landfill sites is low gmde with little agriculural potential. That for WTWs and
STWs in both Kunming and Qujing is of higher cash value, being located within the urban area. In
Qujing high qualitv arable land is to be acquired.

* compensation for loss of earnings by affected local businesses; use RAP
* provide temporary bridges across open trenches for pedesians
* plan work schedules to minimise the time businesses ar affected. this can be
done by working in short sections so that trenching. laying and refurbishing
will be completed in the section in less than one week
* acquire good information on underground services to avoid damage to
existing sewer. water and gas mains, telephonc and electricity lines
* preparc contingency plans for dealing with damage to other services
* provide adequate sign posting of diversions due to road closures with the
assistance of appropriate local authorities
* plan road closures and diversions to minimise disruption and inconvenience
* ensure trench spoil is removed from site or properly stacked to prevent
fouling of pavements and oads.
Qujing WTW          In addition to the social inpacts lisbtd above, the building of the Du Mu to
Qujing aqueduct will involve considerable tunnelling and spoil production:
* a disposaVreuse plan for this material needs to be drawn up to avoid
pollution of land and water rsources
Noise (all projects)  Noise produced by constuction vehicles and machinery is not prone to efiective
mitigation measures in populated areas:
*   avoidnoiseproducigacidvitiesatunsociablehours especiallynighttime.
Dust (all projects)   Dust caused by eardiworks cannot easily be avoided; the dust so produced can
be raised by wind and veiclks
* mitiate impact by wating and covering after the earthworks are finised.
Traffic congestion   Inappropriate siting of works cntances and exits. or the use of a single access
(all projects)      poinL can produce scvere local congestonm
* plan works layout to avoid congestion:
* provide temporary access roads or mutes if possible:
* route site taffic to avoid areas of congestion.

Landfill site    Leachate controL treament and monitoring:
* the sites must be lined with impermeable material to meet local standards to
prevent contamination of water rsources:
* intercepted leachate must be treated to reduce BOD. pathogens and
suspended solids before release to the environmenL Local effluent discharge
standards are to be observed. lTe treatment pond should have sufficient
capacity to hold leachate plus stornwater flows: this may then result in
evaporation exceeding inflow producing zero effluent outflow.
* leachate outflow composition must be monitored along with local water
resources liable to contamination by the outflow:
Gas control and monitoring:
* production of biogenic gases must be monitored: useful gas (methane) could
be used for local residential heating oras a final resort burned off by an
automatic ignition system to avoid explosions;
Odour.
* odour s  produced are likely to dispersed rapidly by wind in the project
landfill sites. the remote locations also lessens the population affected to
those actually working at the landfill:
Dust:
* will be produced by the fill covering activities and tipping of waste from
delivery trucks; damping the waste on delivery and the cover materid wil
reduce the impacts:
e ensure adequate site water supply for damping operations:
Noise:
,   ddivery trucks and roliers involved in covering are the main souces of ooise
at the landfill: impacts can be mitigated by engine silencers and avoiding
night time wodcing
Transfer and     Noise:
collection       * collections from street bins in residental areas occurs at night and poses a
problem for mitigation: noise can be reduced by caw on the part ofthe bin
handlers and truck drives: little in the way of technical intervention will
reduce the dB level Intnoducing plastic bins would reduce noise levels.
Adverse impacts on villages en rowe to the landfills requires drivers to adjust
their driving to reduce noise;
DusL
* during trnsfer in coal burning areas dust may be a problen; as with noise,
care by the operatives is the main solution:
Trffrc congestion:
* night time operations should alleviate most congestion problems:

7.2 Resettlement
Only in the case of the sites of Sewage Treatment Works No 4b (163 persons) in Kunming and the Gejiu
sewage treatment works (21 persons) will there be any need for any residential resettlement A diled
Resettlement Action Plan and a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) have been prepared, and
resettlement is described in detil in Annex F to the Project ReporL
7.3 Wastewater rreatment Impacts
The principal impact associated with wastewater treatment is the generation of substantial quantities of
treatment restdues i %ludge. grit and screenings). At full development of wastewater treatment facilities
in Kunming the tot al quantitv ot sludee requiring disposal would be in the order of 200 tVd in the form of
dewatered sludcc cale. IEven wherc the quality of sludge would be acceptable for use in agriculttre, it is
unlikely that thcre %bould be sutTicicnt demand for usc in agriculturc to reduce this quantity significantly.
Thc primary disposal route will therefore be by landfill at the new sites serving Kunming. Disposal of
sludge from the %%astewater treatment facilities at Qujing and Gejiu will also be by landfill.
The other main impacts of wastewater treatment are odour and noise, principally frmm aeation
equipment. Problems of odour are minimised in most cases by the absence of primary teatment and
hence the need to process pnmary sludge. Odour will be fiurthcr minimised by rapid disposal of sludge
to avoid storaur and bv providing green belt buffrer zones around the periphey of die sites. Noise
impact will be minimised bv works design to maximise distances from any sensitive receives and
where necessarv h1 acoustic insulation of buildings.
7.4 Solid Waste Disposal Impacts
The major impacts from landfill disposal of municipal waste will be the generation of leachate and of
landfill gas. At all sites groundwater will be protected by provision of synthetic site liners and by
collection of leachate. It is proposed to store leachate for recirculation through the landfilL therey
minimising both the quanuty for disposal and its polluting charcter.
The location of the sites a substantial distanc from significant centres of population, is beneficial in
terms of reducing odour nuisance. However, it also means that it is unlikely that beneficial use of
landfill gas for energzy recoverv will be economic. Landfill gas will thercfore be flared for safety reasons
and for conversion of methane. a potent greenhouse gas. to the less potent carbon dioxide.
7.5 Construction Spoil Disposal
Considerable quantities of excavation spoil will be generated during the construction of all water and
wastewater treatment works, water tmnsmission and seweage systems. In particular dthre will be
substantial amounts of tunnelling spoil fiom tie Du Mu tunnel (93 km) and pipeline (33.3 km) in
Qujing and the tunnel (1.3 kln) in Gejiu. Detailed spoil disposal plans will be prepared, incorporating
wherever possible the beneficial use of spoil as aggrgae or hardcore in construction actividies or
landscaping.
7.6 Industrv Pollution Control Impacts
The production upgrading proposals at the two fertiliser factories include new facilities for production of
sulphuric acid from sulphur. Tail gases from these upgraded production facilities contain sulphur
dioxide and acid aerosols and are to be discharged to the atmosphere. The discharges are via tall stucks,
45m and 60m for the Kunming Chemical Fertiliser- and Kunyang Phosphate Fertiliser Factory
respectively. In the individual environmental assessmenrt for the two factories it is shown by
calculation that the discharges would not result in unacceptable ground level concenwaion of the
pollutants.
A total of 2.67ha of land will be required peranentlyfor facy extsion. (2.06ha at K,mming CFF)I,
no resettlement is involved though 36 people will be ffected (23 at KCFF, 13 at KPFF).

7.7 Other Construction Impacts
A number of other impacts will arise as a result of construction activities, including disruption to taffic
and municipal services. temporary loss of ffriniand. noise and dusL In all cases impact will be
minimised by adherence to defined opeational procedures. liaison with the appropriate audtorities and
appropriate compensation where necessarv. For example noise impact will be minimised by restrictions
on hours of workine and dust from cxcavation and spoil transport by means of water sprays and by
vehicle washing. covenne and controls on loading of vehicles. Disnrption to shop owners and
pedestrians during sewer and water main installation will be mitigaped via standing local procedur.
