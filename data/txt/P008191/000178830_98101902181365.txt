INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXBCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR AN AIRPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Venezuela for the equivalent of $17 million to help
finance the construction of a new runway and related facilities at Maiquetia
International Airport, located close to Caracas. The loan would have a term
of fifteen pears, including three-and-a-half years of grace, and carry in-
terest at 7-4 percent per annum. A Project Agreement would be signed with
the Maiquetia International Airport Authority.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Venezuela received its first loan, for roads, in December 1961.
Since that date total Bank lending, net of cancellations, has aggregated
$328 million, about 45 percent of which has been for electric power and the
rest for roads (30 percent), telecommunications (20 percent) and water
supply8  The last loan in the amount of $35 million, made in June 1971 for
a telecommunications project, is not yet effective mainly because of delays
which the Borrower has encountered in reaching arrangements with official
institutions for the collection of bills for telecommunications services.
A statement on Bank loans and IFC investments as at December 31, 1971 is
attached as Annex I.
3.        Execution of Bank-financed projects in Venezuela has on the whole
been satisfactory except for a water supply project in Caracas (Loan 444-VE)
where the Borrower was unable to obtain an increase in its water tariffs
from the municipalities responsible for rate setting, and consequently the
agreed rate covenant was not complied with. As a result, disbursements on
the loan were suspended for almost two years in agreement with the Govern-
ment and the Borrower, pending a final decision on tariffs. The loan was
closed at the end of August 1970, when the remaining balance of about $4.2
million was cancelled.  Construction on the project is now completed.
4.        IFO has committed $28 million to Venezuela since 1960, covering
investments in six enterprises. The most recent operation was in December
1971 when IFC made a stand-by commitment of $1 million to purchase bonds to
be issued by Dominguez & Cia. Caracas, S.A., a tin can manufacturer.
5.        Venezuela does not receive any significant amount of bilateral
aid other than technical assistance, and borrowing from official sources
is limited to the World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and to export credit agencies in equipmaent-supplying countries.



- 2 -
Assistance from the IDB reached a total of $335 million by the end of 1971,
of which $142 million came from Ordinary Capital, currently bearing an
interest rate of 8 percent per annum, and the balance from the Special
Progress Trust Fund and the Fund for Special Operations. Funds from the
latter now carry an interest of 4 percent per annum. IDB lending through
the mid-1960's had been mainly for housing, water and sewerage and subsis-
tence agriculture, principally from IDB's soft loan window. Since then, IDB
assistance has been directed increasingly towards industry, electric power
and highways, mainly using Ordinary Capital funds, but support for subsis-
tence agriculture, from the Fund for Special Cperations, was resumed in
1971. Venezuela has had access to private capital markets in the past,
having floated a $15 million public bond issue in New York in 1965 and
another $25 million in Germany in 1968. In 1969 and 1970, the Government
obtained almost $200 million from United States and Canadian banks, at
terms of five years and an interest cost averaging one percent over the
U.S. prime rate. In April 1971 the Government negotiated for the state-owned
petrochemical company a $70 million loan with a seven-year maturity in the
BEro-dollar market at a rate of 1i percent above the six months inter-bank
Eiro-dollar rate in London adjusted every six months. However, access to
private capital markets has been limited to borrowing at five to seven-year
terms, and soundings made by the Government in late 1970 in New York indica-
ted there would be difficulty in raising long-term funds in substantial
amounts, and that the terms were likely to be unfavorable.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        The most recent economic report on Venezuela (CA-5a) is dated
October 12, 1970. An economic data sheet is attached as Annex II. In
presenting the telecommunications project last June (President's Report
P-966, dated June 14, 1971), I pointed out that, while Venezuela had the
highest per capita income in Latin America, many sectors of the economy
were still quite under-developed, and that the task of development was made
more difficult by the country's heavy dependence on petroleum, which in
1970 accounted for over 90 percent of exports and three-fifths of govern-
ment revenues, but made little direct contribution to employment.  The
justification for Bank lending in these circumstances has been based
essentially on Venezuelats need for technical assistance in carrying forward
the diversification of its economy and the limited possibilities of borrowing
in private capital markets abroad on reasonable terms. However, the steps
which the Venezuelan Government has taken, beginning just over a year ago,
to increase its tax "take" from oil have considerably eased the fiscal and
balance of payments constraints under which the economy was operating in
1969 and 1970 and have correspondingly improved the possibilities for acceler-
ating economic growth. Another Bank economic mission has therefore visited
the country in September/Qctober to reassess the economic outlook and the
justification for continued Bank lending.



- 3 -
7.        It now seems likely that petroleum revenues and balance of
payments receipts will have increased by about $450 million in 1971, des-
pite a 3 percent decline in output. WIth the higher reference prices now
established for 1972, petroleum revenues In 1972 are estimated to rise by
another $330 million. The 1971 increase alone is equivalent to over 4 per-
cent of GDP and about 20 percent of all the current revenues of the public
sector in 1969. Further smaller increases appear to be assured for the
years after 1972 on the basis of the five-year agreement reached in early
1971 covering the petroleum-producing countries in the Middle East. With
current expenditures rising only moderately, central government savings are
projected to increase from Bs2.7 billion ($600 million) in 1970 to Bs4.3
billion in 1971 and Bs5.0 billion in 1972, while public investments financed
out of central goverrment savings would rise from Bs3.5 billion in 1970 to
around Bs4 billion in 1971 and Bs4.7 billion in 1972 (after allowing for
some shortfall on the budgeted figures because of likely delay's in the
implementation of certain programs). Three-quarters of the budgeted
increase in public investment between 1970 and 1972 is concentrated in
two sectors, transportation (mainly highways) and petroleum (including
the initial expenditure on a large liquid natural gas development). The
remaining increases are mainly in education and in water and sewerage.
8.        Notwithstanding this rapid build-up of public sector investments,
both the central government budget and the balance of payments are likely
to show significant surpluses in 1971 and 1972 and possibly also in 1973.
In fact, official foreign exchange reserves reached by the end of 1971 a
record level of around $1.4 billion(as against $10 billion a year ago)
and may be expected to increase further during the coming year. At the
same time Venezuela should be able to achieve an appreciably higher rate
of growth of GMP than the 5 percent estimated in the last economic report
and, if it uses its resources well, to make an impression on the urgent
problems of employment and urbanization. There will also be less need to
borrow abroad.
9.        The case for continued Bank lending to Venezuela can no longer
rest in part, as it did before oil revenues increased, on the need to cover
a prospective gap in the budget or balance of payments, since no such gap
is now in prospect during the next few years, and the principal factor
limiting development expenditures in the short run is the administrative
capacity of the public sector rather than any shortage of funds. On the
other hand, taking a longer view, there is still as great a need as there
ever was for a diversification of the Venezuelan econony away from oil,
and to the extent that Bank participation in the financing of specific
projects can assist in this task by strengthening public institutions,
supporting sound economic and financial policies and improving the
efficiency of the public sector, I consider that some further lending by
the Bank is consistent with its role as a development institution.



10.       In defining this policy with the Government over the past two
years, the Bank has been guided by the development strategy outlined in
the 1970 Economic Report, which put primary emphasis on the need to con-
centrate infrastructural investments in the "Core Region" of the country,
extending from just east of Caracas to west of Valencia. It is principally
in this region that the base exists for the expansion of industry and
tourism and the creation of new jobs to absorb the urban unemployed and
to relieve under-employment in rural areas. At the same time, as noted
in paragraph 5 above, a main focus of IDB lending is on the agricultural
sector. Ihe proposed airport project, the telecommunications project
recently approved and the project under discussion for the construction of
the Caracas metro are all designed to build up the country's industrial
base and to enable the main centers of economic activity to function more
efficiently. In two cases (the airport and the metro) Bank participation
would help in establishing an important new operating agency on a sound
business footing and in the third (telecommunications) it would contribute
towards strengthening the management and finances of an already existing
institution. Moreover, considerable advantages are expected to accrue in
all these projects from international competitive bidding which would be
difficult to arrange without the Bank's intervention.
11.      IThe Bank has already appraised two other projects in Venezuela,
one for extending medium and long-term credit to commercial livestock
farmers, the other for the improvement and expansion of secondary education.
After some delay, the Government has just been authorized by Congress to
seek external financing for the livestock project, and negotiations have
been substantially completed. The education project has not yet received
Congressional authorization. Preparation of the metro project has been
delayed by a lack of agreement between the Government and the two munici-
palities concerned over the organization and methods of financing and over
the institutional arrangements for transport coordination in the Caracas
area.
12.       All the projects mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, including
the proposed airport project, have been under discussion with the Venezuelan
authorities for periods ranging between one and two years, and pr9Ject
preparation has proceeded on the assumption that, so long as the results of
the appraisal proved satisfactory, Bank financing would be considered. I
recommend therefore that the Bank continue its association with these
projects to the extent that they have the full support of the Venezuelan
Government and Congress, and that, for the rest, future lending be limited
to a few selected projects which would make a significant contribution to
the diversification of the economy and where the Bank could make a substan-
tial impact on institutions and sector policies. This implies a substan-
tially lower level of Bank lending to Venezuela than was expected eighteen
months ago when the Economic Report was discussed with the Government. In
particular, no further lending would be considered in the foreseeable
future for power or highway projects which have accounted for the bulk of
Bank lending to Venezuela in the past.



- 5 -
13.       Venezuela should be fully capable of servicing the proposed
Bank loans.  Its present external debt service ratio is low (around 4
percent), and although the longer-term outlook for petroleum production
is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the service contracts recently
signed with several international oil companies for the exploration of
an area south of Lake Naracaibo offer a reasonable prospect that total
production can be maintained at around the present level for at least the
next five years. Venezuela's competitive position as a supplier of
petroleum has probably not suffered from the recent price increases in
view of parallel developments in North Africa and the Middle East. Never-
theless, as noted in my report of last June, oil exploration in Venezuela
is low by historical standards because the private companies have out back
investments in anticipation of the end of their concessions in 1983, and
the state oil company, with only about 5 percent of present productive
capacity, is not yet in a position to take up the slack. It is therefore
most important that the Government should adopt policies which will encourage
new investments in the petroleum sector, while also pushing ahead with
plans for exploiting natural gas, iron ore and other minerals.
PART III - THE PROJECT
14.       This would be the second airport project financed by the Bank.
It is part of a master plan for the development of the Maiquetia Inter-
national Airport. The Government approached the Bank for financing of the
project in the first half of 1970. An appraisal mission visited Venezuela
in December 1970 and found that the engineering and economic work were not
sufficiently advanced to allow for appraisal of all aspects of the plan.
It was subsequently agreed with the Government that the plan would be
executed in two parts: the construction of a new runway, taxiways and
associated facilities (Part I), and the construction of a terminal build-
ing complex and related facilities (Part II). The proposed project
confines itself to Part I.  A second project, which would comprise Part II,
is tentatively scheduled for appraisal during the second half of 1972.
Negotiations for the proposed Part I project took place in December 1971.
The negotiating team was headed by General Rafael Alfonzo Ravard, Governor
of the Bank for Venezuela.
15.       The project consists of the construction at Maiquetia Interna-
tional Airport of (a) a new paved runway 3,500 m. x 45 m. with parallel
and connecting taxiways, (b) control tower, (c) runway and taxiway lighting
and navigation aids, including an Instrument Landing System (IES), and
certain improvements in existing facilities. It also includes consultants'
services for the detailed design of the terminal complex to be built in
the second phase of the master plan, and for strengthening management and
accounting of the Airport Anthority.  The total estimated cost of the pro-
ject is about $54.5 million, of which $1.1 million represents the cost of



- 6 -
land to be acquired for the project against the issue by the Government
of 7 percent nine-year bolivar bonds. QC the remaining $43.1 million,
the foreign exchange component is estimated at $19.5 million. The proposed
$17 million Bank loan would finance 87 percent of the foreign exchange
component. The Government would finarnce the remaining 13 percent of the
foreign exchange costs and the whole of the local currency expenditures.
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III, and Maps 1 and 2
show the locations of airports in Venezuela and neighboring countries and
the layout of Maiquetia International Airport.
16.       The project has a three-fold objective. First, it aims at
providing important infrastructure for the industrial and tourist develop-
ment in the Core Regioin, thereby contributing to the diversification of
the economy.-   The Maiquetia Airport constitutes the focal point from
which the main domestic and international air routes radiate. In 1969 it
handled 95 percent of all the international traffic of the country and 46
percent of all domestic passenger traffic, involving some 50,000 commercial
aircraft movements and close to 1.3 million passengers. The Maiquetia
Airport is thus one of the busiest in South America and the Caribbean.
However, Caracas remains one of only two aviation centers in the world
handling over half million international passengers a year which does not
have an airport equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS).A/ This
guidance equipment, which is needed to meet the international safety
standards for the operation of the current generation of jet aircraft,
cannot be installed on the present runway due to the nature of the terrain.
The new runway, which will also be longer than the existing one to permit
departure of flights with longer stage lengths, will have a different
orientation to the existing one, thus avoiding terrain obstruction and
enabling the installation of an ILS system. The project will therefore
produce benefits primarily in the form of improved safety in handling the
increasing traffic at the airport.
17.       Although jet aircraft have used the present airport for a
number of years, the existing safety standards do not meet those recom-
mended by the International Civil Aviation Crganization and the United
States Federal Aviation Agency. Moreover, the International Air Transport
Association, representing the major airline operators, has been pressing
1/ In this context, it is recalled that the Bank is executing agency for
a UNDP-financed master plan and feasibility study for the tourism
development of the Los Caracas-Higuerote area near the Maiquetia
Airport.
2/  The other is Wellington, New Zealand.



for ILS to be installed on all runways regularly used by international
air services. Thus, the operation of Venezuela's principal airport
involves greater risks than are generally accepted under present standards
adopted on a worldwide basis, and the Government's new plan to bring
Maiquetia up to accepted standards appears justified. Project appraisal
has shown that there is no alternative site near Caracas where the recog-
nized airport safety requirements could be met at less costs and clearly
Venezuela's main international airport could not be restricted to the
types of aircraft (propeller aircraft) that can use it safely.
18.       The second objective of this project is the establishment of a
sound organization for the operation of the airport. Until now, the airport
has been managed by the Civil Aeronautics Ebard of the Ministry of Comiunica-
tions, but coordination between the various divisions of the Ministry at
the airport, the headquarters unit and the other Ministries providing
services at the airport has been ineffective. Because of diffused respon-
sibilities and lack of strong management, the services at the airport, as
well as planning and financial management, have been inadequate.  The
Government recognized the undesirability of making a major investment in
the airport in these circumstances, and it is now setting up an Airport
Authority as an "autonomous institute"., in accordance with a recently
enacted law. In line with the objective of establishing a sound organiza-
tion, funds have been included in the proposed loan for management and
accounting consultancy services to help the Authority in establishing and
implementing sound financial planning and accounting methods and the
introduction of a management information system.
19.       Institutional arrangements call for the Government to construct
the airport project, through its iMinistry of Public Works, and for the
transfer to the Authority of the present airport and the new facilities to
be constructed. By the time the Bank became involved in the project,
enabling legislation to borrow had been passed by Congress, and the Govern-
ment was considering legislation to establish the Authority. Although the
Bank would have preferred to make the proposed loan directly to the Authority,
in line with its normal practice, this was not practical since it would have
entailed the resubmission of the enabling legislation to Congress. A
special law would also have had to be passed reappropriating some $10 mil-
lion of the Ministry of Public Workts 1971 budget to the Authority for the
initial works on the project. In view of this, and considering that the
execution of the project will be the responsJbility of the Government,
through the Ministry of Public Works, it is prcposed that the Bank enter
into a Loan Agreement with the Government and a Project Agreement with the
Authority. This arrangement would permit the Bank to maintain a direct
contractual relationship with the institutions responsible both for build-
ing and for operating the airport.
20,       The third objective is the determination of the airportfs capacity
(i.e., assuring that the size and design standards of the airport are in



- 8 -
line with a reasonable forecast of demands) and the establishment of
pricing policies scaled to the cost of providing these services at the
airport, but which would permit a substantial part of the project
benefits to be recaptured by the Venezuelan economy. Ihis is particularly
important in Venezuela where there has been a tendency for public works to
be over-designed and for user charges to be set below costs.
21.       Additional work needs to be done before the proper size, design
and phasing of the terminal building complex can be determined. It was
for this reason that, rather than delay the entire project by at least one
year, the Government agreed with the Bank to split the project into two
parts, as indicated in paragraph 14 above.
22.       The Government agrees that user charges should be set at levels
which will ensure that an adequate share of the total economic benefits
from the airport investment will be retained within the Venezuelan econoyn,
and should recover the cost of the investment over its economic life.   The
proposed project provides for a consultant's study designed to establish
the basis for the level and structure of user charges required to satisfy
these objectives from 1974 onwards, when the new investments come into
service   The present level of charges will satisfy the minimum rate of
return on nat fixed assets in operation agreed with the Bank of 6 percent
and 8 percent in 1972 and 1973 respectively. The required minimum rate of
return from 1974 onwards will be agreed with the Government and the Airport
Authority when the results of the consultant's study on user charges and
additional information on future traffic trends are available.
23.       The Authority is expected to obtain substantial cash surpluses
from user charges, but will retain only cash required for its operations.
The balance will accrue to the Government and will more than cover the
service on the proposed loan. The Government will make available to the
Authority funds required to finance future expansion.
24.       Retroactive financing is included in an amount of about $1.6
million, to cover the first part of the main earth moving contract ($1 million)
and the engineering and consulting services before signing of the proposed
loan ($0.6 million)0 These works are an important and integral element of
the project, and delaying them would have seriously affected the timing of
the construction of the new runway.
25.       In view of Venezuela's favorable fiscal and balance of payments
situation, it is proposed that the loan should have a term of fifteen years,
including three-and-a-half years of grace, instead of the twenty years
which would be normal for a loan for an airport runway.
