IlEiMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A SMALL RURAL OPERATIONS PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for SDR 7.1 million (US$9.3
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a
project for Small  Rural Operations.   The project would  be cofinanced  by
Switzerland for SF10.8 million (US$7.8 million equivalent).
2.        Backaround.    Past experiences  with rainfed  projects in  areas
with rainfall of 600 mm/year or less (including IDA-financed Dosso and
Maradi II projects) have been disappointing. In recognition of these
failures, an SPPF-financed rural sector study has been launched to reassess
the agricultural potential of the meager resource ba3e, and to devise
measures  to  realize  such  potential.   In  addition,  a  survey  of  the
agricultural research system is well under way, aiming to prioritize
research themes and to make the research institutions more effective.
Since the natural resource endowment of the rainfed farming area is quite
variable, site-specific small rural operations (SR10) provide effective
development opportunities where local relief, soil, market or other
conditions are favorable, and if institutional capacity to exploit such
opportunities exists. Accordingly, with FAO/CP assistance, a project has
bten prepared including a feasibility study of selected models of SROs, and
the undertaking  of  three pilot  SROs  under  a PPF.   While  these  three
operations did not fully meet expectations, important lessons have been
learned about the need for careful preparation with the beneficiary
comunity and effective follow-up by local staff. Subsequent IDA-financed
SROs in the Maradi II project and similar operations in other projects
financed by other donors have proven to be reasonably successful.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA is helping the government  to
carry out structural adjus2tment measures which aim, among other things, to
improve the efficiency of resource use in the rural sector. The supply
response to the adjustment program will, however, depend on technically and
economically viable solutions for long-term development of the rural sector
and on the institutional capability to assist farmers in maximizing their
long-term resource potential.  The proposed project aims to strengthen  the
institutional capability to exploit potential where local conditions are
favorable, albeit on a small scale, by making use of existing technologies,
to improve  rural  income  and  to protect  the  fragile  environment.   In
addition, IDA has a major role to play in helping the Government to
harmonize  rules   to   be   applied  to   SROs,   particularly   regarding
beneficiaries' contributions and arrangements for renewing medium-term
equipment, since the other donors already active in SROs are reluctant to
take the lead.

4.        Project  Obiectives.    The  proposed  project  would  help   the
Government improve its institutional capability to prepare, appraise,
execute and evaluate small rural operations (SROs) as well as to provide
effective extension  once  SROs  become  operational.   The  project  would
strengthen the capabilities of the provincial and district technical staff
who would assist farmers in the design, preparation and execution of SROs.
The project is seen as the first phase of a program of IDA support to SROs
which would eventually have a national scope.
5.        Prcject Description.  The proposed project would seek to  achieve
the above objectives by financing: (a) equipment, vehicles and operating
costs associated with preparation/appraisal/execution of SROs by the
provincial and district staff;   (b)) training for  the technical staff  in
project  analysis  and  extension  and  for  beneficiaries  in   functional
literacy; (c) technical assistance needed to support a decentralized
financiil management system and to strengthen project analysis capability
at the provincial levels; (d) in grant form, investment proposals submitted
by  farmers  which  meet  the  selection  criteria,  including   bottomland
improvements, small irrigated perimeters, soil conservation and watershed
management, social forestry and village tree nurseries; (e) complementary
studies to improve preparation capabilities. The project, to be carried
out over 5 years, provides funds for civil works; vehicles, equipment and
furniture; agricultural inputs: conaultants' services, studies and audits;
operating costs; training; and goods and services for unidentified SROs.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$18.0 r.illion equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$7.9 million (44Z).  A breakdown  of
costs and financing plan are shown  in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods  of
procurement and disbursements, and the  disbursement schedule are shown  in
Schedule S.  A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank  Croup  operations  in  Niger  are   given  in  Schedules  C  and   D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6910-NIR dated February 22, 1988 is also attached.
6.        The Government recognizes  that the  proliferation of  procedures
and institutional set-ups in the Ministry of Planning is not an ideal
situation and agreed to IDA's proposal to conduct an organizational study,
aiming to recommend ways to harmonize procedures imposed by different
donors, including the possibility of creating an autonomous structure of
funding. The study is being financed by Swiss bilateral funds and started
in December 1987, according to the terms of reference and by the consultant
approved by IDA. The project's organizational structure would be amended
once a decision on a new organizational structure is made by the Government
in consultation with IDA. Until then, the project will be coordinated and
supervised by a unit in the Directorate of Regional Development and
Micro-realization (DDRM) in the Ministry of Planning, which is currently
responsible for  promoting SROs.   Provincial and  district Governors  will
play a decisive role in the approval of proposed SROs and in mobilizing
technical services for assisting local groups in the preparation and
implementation of SROs. This is in line with the decentralization policy
of the Government and the Governors have been increasingly empowered with



decision-making and execution responsibilities that were formerly the
prerogative of central ministries.
7.        Agreed Actions.   The principal  actions on  which agreement  has
been reached with the Government are thats (i) as a condition for the
provision of medium term assets, including anizals, to any group of
producers, the group would open and pay into its Capital Replacement
Account an amount of at least 52 of the delivered cost of such assets, and
such payments would be vekified by the DDRM unit; (ii) the Governrent would
convene regular meetings at least once a year with local representatives of
the donors involved in SRO-type operations, to discuss their investment
programs, rules and  procedures, evaluation  of past  activities, etc.,  in
order to improve coordination and programming; and (iii) upon completion of
the organizational study, the Government would review with IDA the
recommendation of the study and not later than December 31, 1990, the
Government  would  carry  out   those  recommendations  approved  by   IDA.
Conditions of Effectiveness are that (i) the project accounting system and
procedures satisfactory to IDA have been established and that the Financial
Director has been recruited; and (ii) the Government has presented to IDA
the first year program of SROs to be financed after project start-up.
B.        Justification.  Given the decline of uranium revenues and Niger's
limited resource base, the development of agriculture is essential to
future growth. Small rural operations, designed to be rasponsive to local
conditions, and for which appropriate technology is available, appear to be
tbe most feasible means of generating income in the short-term. In the
meantime, the quest for medium-term approaches to rural income generation
will le pursued through improving national services, particularly research
and extension.
9.        Risks.   The  technical  risks   associated with  the   proposed
investment  are  minimal  because   they  involve  well-known  and   simple
techniques. The project, however, faces a few other risks. First, low
motivation and poor qualifications of local staff may slow the pace of
development. The risk is expected to be minimized by substantial training,
which has already started, combined with the increasingly effective
authority of the Governors. Second, assets created under the project may
not be  adequately maintained  because beneficiaries  lose interest.   This
risk would be reduced by insisting on the cash downpayment for medium-term
assets and by establishing a development contract between beneficiaries and
local authorities laying down all the obligations and responsibilities. In
addition, work would be designed in such a way that maintenance would not
require skills, materials and tools not readily available at the village
levels. Finally, coordination with other donors and NGOs may prove
difficult. This risk would be reduced by regular coordination meetings to
be held by the GovLrnment and by the organizational study to recommend how
the harmonization of rules and procedures imposed by various donors would
be achieved.

20.       Recommendation.  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit would
comply with the articlos of agreement of the Association and recoumend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
