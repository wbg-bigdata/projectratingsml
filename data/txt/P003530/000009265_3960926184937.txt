MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SHAANXI PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China for US$50.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 20 years maturity including a 5 years grace
period at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
the expansion and improvement of the highway network.
2.        Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. The most serious transport need is for dramatically
expanded road capacity, especially in rural areas where increased agricultural
and small-scale industrial production have created an urgent demand for better
farm-to-market transport services. Road transport will also face a growing
share of the demand for passenger transportation from the increasingly mobile
population. In the railway subsector, the network capacity has severely
hampered delivery of energy supplies (i.e. coal), and even with recently
initiated investments in rail line electrification and new line construction,
it will take several years to alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas
and coastal cities. China also needs to substantially expand its port and
waterways facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth capacity and container handling capacity. China's Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes al. these sectoral needs. By the end of
the plan period, freight traffic is projected to be 45% higher than in 1985,
and passenger traffic 60% higher, with a disproportionately greater share of
the increase falling on road transport. To meet these needs, substantial
investments are envisioned, especially in highway network expansion, new rail
lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing lines, and more berths
at coastal ports. The Plan also proposes to secure efficiency gains in
transportation from operational improvements; these include the development of
integrated transportation networks, in particular for coal transportation and
for import/export trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Plan envisions significant institutional changes in the
sector, including and extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises and delegating authority to
local managements. The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives
for development of the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with
financial and technical assistance. Three railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA,
2540-CEA and 2678-CHA, and Credit 1680-CHA) are assisting the expansion of
capacity on key routes and the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger
coaches and signalling equipment. Four port projects (Loans 2207-CHA, 2689-
CHA, 2907-CHA and 2977-CHA) will effect improvements at Tianjin, Shanghai,
Huangpu and Dalian Ports. The two Bank Group financed highway projects in
China (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA and Loan 2811-CHA/Credit 1792-CHA)
involves the construction and improvement of national, rural roads and the
first expressway in China.



- 2 -
3.        While all transport modes in China are in urgent need of expansion
and modernization, road transport presents the most difficult challenge. Road
freight traffic has increased at about 17% per annum between 1980 and 1986
mainly due to the burgeoning market economy, and passenger traffic has grown
at about 16% per annum. Road congestion was already a serious problem in the
early 1980, and has now grown worse near major cities. Increased road capa-
city is urgently needed.  Furthermore, of the approximately 942,400 km roads
in 1985, only some 195,000 km, or 21%, have asphaltic or concrete pavements.
These pavements are generally of poor quality; most have exceeded their design
life and are deteriorating rapidly with the increasing traffic. Accordingly,
the highway mode is receiving increased attention under the Seventh Five-Year
Plan (SFYP). The SFYP for the highway subsector is to upgrade at least 80,000
km of existing road and to construct about 60,000 km of new roads, of which
1,580 km would be 4-lane expressway or Class I standard.
4.        The main objectives for highway development in the 1980's are to
provide adequate capacity in the heavily congested corridors, to upgrade and
improve the existing network and to expand the network in remote rural
areas. The proposed new Sanyuan-Tongchuan Highway in Shaanxi Province is part
of the plan for high standard road investment and would be a continuation of
the Xi'an-Sanyuan Highway being financed under Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA,
Bank's first highway project in China. The rural road development in Shaannan
(Southern Shaanxi Province), the poorest part of the province, serves the
objective of rural road network expansion and rural development. There is
also an urgent need in the province for more modern techniques in the
planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Government is seeking Bank Group
assistance in removing the transport bottlenecks impeding economic growth.
The strategy for the Bank's involvement in the highway subsector is to meet
the most urgent needs of road network expansion and to suggest a program of
studies on key policies issues so as to provide a sound basis for future
investment planning. The Bank's involvement in the highway subsector
particularly in terms of policy, institutional and technical matters under the
first and second highway projects, aims at helping to modernize the subsector
by bringing the Bank's experience to bear on the problems and by expediting
the introduction of advanced technology to solve them; on going studies in
these projects cover important problems related to roads financing, road
safety, road congestion and the methodology for evaluating existing road
pavements. The proposed project, besides providing adequate road capacity in
this most congested corridor of Shaanxi Province, would provide continued
support in these matters and encompass new tasks related to road pavement
strengthening, maintenance and planning. The project is one of the four
highway projects currently being prepared to focus Bank assistance at the
level of four provinces simultaneously.
6.        Project Objectives.  The proposed Sanyuan-Tongchuan Highway would
help expand transport capacity in the heavily congested corridor between the
provincial capital of Xi'an and the important coal mining district and city of
Tongchuan. The rural roads improvement and flood repair program would help
the development of the poorest areas in Southern Shaanxi Province. Specific
policy, institutional and technological objectives to be addressed by the



project would be: (a) to improve road planning techniques by setting up a
computerized road data bank; (b) to evaluate existing paved roads And to
prepare a pavement strengthening and maintenance management programa; (c) to
assist in staff training program; (d) to continue assistance to modernize
design, construction, and materials' specifications and contract
documentation; and (e) to carry out a road safety program.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed project would be carried out by
Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD), under the overall responsi-
bility of the Shaanxi Provincial Government. The project would include:
(a) construction of a 67 km new highway (about 51 km of Class I and 16 km of
Class II) connecting Sanyuan with the city of Tongchuan (49 km with normal
contractor construction and 18 km with force account construction through an
archaeological area); (b) expansion, improvement and repair of the rural road
network in southern Shaanxi; (c) evaluation of the existing paved roads to
prepare a program for strengthening, betterment and maintenance; (d) staff
training; and (e) assistance to SPTD in improved road planning by setting up a
computerized data bank.
8.        Estimated project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement methods and estimated disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable for key project processing events are shown in Schedule C and
Schedule D gives a statement of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and IFC operations in
China. Maps showing Shaanxi Provincial Transport Network and the Sanyuan-
Tongchuan Highway are attached.  A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7167-CHA dated
March 12, 1988 is being distributed separately.
9.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations Shaanxi provincial government
agreed that: (a) the findings of the road safety study done by Ministry of
Communications (MOC) under the first Bank's highway project (Loan 2539/Credit
1594) be implemented in Shaanxi; (b) a representative from the Chinese
Provincial Archaeological Institute would on site full time during the
construction of the 18 km section of the road that passes through an area of
great archaeological significance; and (c) the road pavement evaluation, road
data bank, and staff training programs be carried out according to terms of
reference and timing agreeable to the Bank. An assurance was obtained during
negotiations from Shaanxi provincial government that Shaanxi carry out the
resettlement under the project in accordance with the plan agreed with the
Bank.
10.       Benefits.  Traffic already exceeds capacity of the existing road,
speed is low and the accident rate is high. Economic benefits under the
proposed project are expected mainly from the vehicle operating cost savings
due to: (a) shorter road distance; (b) improved road quality; and (c) reduced
congestion on existing road. The ERR for the Sanyuan-Tongchuan highway
investment would be 28% and for the rural roads would range from 16X to 25%.
11.       Risks.  Possible delays in completion of the section of road passing
the area of archaeological importance could delay completion of project. To
minimize the risk,the Bank has agreed with SPTD to use force account on this
section to allow more flexibility in rescheduling construction work in order
to use resources more efficiently in the event of archaeological finds. It

was also agreed that a representative from the Archaeological Institute would
be assigned to the site.
12.       Recotrmendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.

/a As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR
credit balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the
dollar and the SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a
dollar amount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Notes:  (1)  The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report
on all Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice
yearly and circulated to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
(2) Subsequent to the above data of Statement A, a loan of $63.0 M and a credit
of SDR 19.8 were approved for the Huangpu Port Project, and a credit of
SDR 123.8 was approved for the Third Rural Credit Project.
