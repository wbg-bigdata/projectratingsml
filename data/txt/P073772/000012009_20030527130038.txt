Project 
Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The primary 
development 
objective 
of 
this 
project 
is 
to 
support 
health 
sector 
decentralization 
in 
four provinces 
for 
sustainable 
financing 
and client-centered 
delivery 
of 
health 
services. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
are 
to: 
(i) 
improve financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
essential 
health 
services 
in 
the 
provinces 
of 
Jambi, 
East 
Kalimantan, 
West 
Kalimantan, 
and 
West 
Sumatera 
to 
enhance 
access 
to 
care, 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
health 
outcomes 
at 
the 
district 
level; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
health 
work 
force policy, 
management and 
development 
in 
a decentralized 
context 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
allocational efficiencies 
and 
equity 
in 
the 
distribution 
and 
use 
of 
health 
resources 
in 
the 
districts. 
A 
corollary 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
empower 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH), 
the 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education (MONE), 
and 
the 
Indonesian 
Medical 
Association 
(IMA), 
the three 
key 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
sector, 
through: 
(i) 
assistance 
to 
redefine their roles 
and 
responsibilities 
vis-a-vis 
health 
work 
force 
policy, planning 
and 
management; and 
(ii) 
building 
their institutional 
capacity 
for 
effective 
stewardship 
in 
fulfilling 
the 
functions 
of 
policy 
malung, 
legislation, regulation, 
quality 
assurance/control 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
provinces 
and 
districts. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
There 
will 
be 
two 
sets 
of 
performance 
indicators.  Project-specific 
sector 
indicators 
include: 
0 
health 
outcome 
indicators 
of 
Infant 
Mortality 
Rate 
(IMR), 
Under-five 
Mortality 
Rate 
(USMR), 
Maternal 
Mortality 
Ratio 
(MMR), 
and 
other 
locally 
relevant 
disease-specific 
indicators 
(Tuberculosis, 
Malaria, 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rates); 
tracer 
health 
services 
indicators, 
including 
proportion 
of 
pregnant 
women 
receiving 
at 
least 
four 
ante-natal visits, 
proportion 
of 
births 
attended 
by 
slulled 
health 
personnel, 
immunization 
coverage rate; 
and 
health 
services 
utilization 
indicators, 
including 
outpatient 
visit 
rate, 
admission 
rate, average 
length 
of 
stay, 
bed 
occupancy 
ratio. 
0 
Data 
to 
estimate 
these 
indicators 
will 
be 
disaggregated 
by 
sex 
and other socioeconomic variables 
(education, 
rurallurban, 
income 
quintile, 
etc.) 
for 
a 
thorough 
monitoring 
of 
inequalities 
in 
health 
outcomes. 
Project-specific indicators 
are 
largely institutional 
and 
organizational 
in 
nature, 
as 
follows: 
1. 
preparation and 
use

Document number:

Date 
of

CAS 
discussion: 
Progress 
Report, dated 
September 
16,2002 
This 
project 
is 
about 
malung 
decentralization 
of 
health 
services management, 
financing 
and 
delivery more effective by: 
(i) 
establishing 
new regional institutions 
and 
mechanisms 
for 
improved 
health 
sector governance; 
(ii) 
redefining 
accountability 
for 
regional 
decision 
malung 
and stewardship 
so 
that 
both 
clients 
and 
provider 
representatives can 
have a 
voice 
in 
system 
management; 
and 
(iii) 
allocating 
resources 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
health 
needs 
and 
preferences 
through 
district 
health 
services 
planning. 
As 
such, 
its 
scope 
and purpose 
concur 
with 
the basic 
tenets 
of 
the Indonesian 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
and 
its 
latest 
progress 
report. 
The 
CAS 
draws 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
equal 
opportunity 
and 
access 
for 
the 
poor 
to 
health 
and education 
services 
through 
greater 
community 
involvement, 
transparency 
and 
institutional 
strengthening 
in 
a decentralized 
setting. 
It 
underscores 
the 
importance 
of 
providing 
demand-responsive 
services, 
especially 
to 
the 
poor, 
to 
reduce 
poverty. 
EAP's 
Indonesia health 
sector strategy, also 
in 
line 
with 
the 
CAS, 
emphasizes 
decentralization 
as 
the 
new 
framework 
for, 
inter 
diu: 
(a) 
raising 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
providers 
in 
terms 
of 
training 
and 
capabilities: 
(b) 
building 
accountability 
by 
giving 
providers 
feedback; 
and 
(c) 
creating 
a 
facilitator function 
to 
help 
the 
poor articulate their 
voice. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Banks 
and the 
regional 
HNP 
strategies 
set 
two 
objectives that 
have 
direct 
bearing 
on 
the 
project 
idea, 
namely 
(i) 
enhancing performance 
of 
health 
systems, 
and 
(ii) 
improving 
health 
outcomes 
of 
the 
poor. 
They 
also 
refer 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
setting health 
policy 
agendas 
in 
times 
of 
decentralization 
and 
of 
building 
appropriate 
incentive 
mechanisms 
to 
increase 
system performance, 
key 
recommendations 
in 
line 
with 
two 
of 
the 
main 
components 
of 
the 
proposed 
project. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
health 
care 
financing 
and 
delivery, 
brought 
along 
two 
potential 
challenges, one 
internal 
and 
another 
external, 
that 
are 
likely to 
exacerbate 
inequalities 
in 
health 
and 
in 
access 
to 
health 
care, 
particularly 
in 
poorer 
regions. 
The internal 
challenge 
is 
intrinsically linked 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
decentralization: 
while 
in 
theory decentralization 
is 
expected 
to provide 
a 
unique opportunity 
to 
bring 
accountability 
closer 
to 
people outside 
Jakarta, 
and 
to 
redefine 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
at 
each 
level 
of 
government 
with 
regard 
to 
human 
resources development, 
financing, 
and 
service management 
and delivery, 
it 
may 
also 
pose 
a threat 
to 
sustainability 
in 
the 
financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
social 
services 
without 
the 
oversight 
role 
of 
a 
central authority 
and 
a 
regulatory 
framework 
that 
explicitly 
binds 
regions 
to 
finance a 
defined 
package 
of 
essential 
health 
services. 
This 
is 
especially 
true 
in 
remote and 
less 
wealthy districts 
where 
technical 
Sectorul 
context. 
The 
decentralization 
of 
key 
government 
functions 
in 
January 2001, 
including 
-4- 
Page  9
skills, 
competences, 
and managerial 
capacities 
are 
scarce; 
and 
where inadequate 
financing, 
low 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
lack 
of 
consumer 
confidence have 
long 
been the 
defining 
features 
of 
the 
publicly-run 
health 
services. 
Simply 
put, 
health 
services management and 
delivery 
at 
the grass-roots 
level 
are 
feared 
to 
be 
disrupted 
without 
political, financial 
and 
technical 
support. 
As 
for 
the 
external 
challenge, 
Indonesia, 
as 
in 
many 
other 
low 
and 
middle 
income 
countries, 
is 
likely 
to 
be overwhelmed 
with 
increased market 
pressure 
and expectations 
of 
the 
well-to-do 
to 
import 
and 
use 
hard 
and soft health 
care technologies 
which 
are 
often 
perceived 
as 
synonymous 
with 
higher 
quality 
of 
care. 
Further, the 
pending 
free movement 
of 
labor 
across 
ASEAN 
countries 
will 
surely 
open 
new 
possibilities 
for 
capital, 
medical know-how 
and 
shlled 
professionals 
to 
enter the 
decentralized 
Indonesian 
health 
care 
market 
to 
serve 
the 
very 
same 
segment 
of 
the 
population.  The 
net 
impact 
on 
the 
long 
run 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
more competition 
and 
better 
quality 
of 
care. 
However, 
the 
short- and 
medium-term implications 
of 
this, 
especially 
in 
poorer districts, 
is 
not 
clear. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
allocational inefficiencies, higher administrative 
costs 
and 
fragmented 
regulatory 
framework. 
Proponents 
of 
decentralization 
argue 
that 
bringing 
decision 
makmg 
closer 
to 
where the 
services 
are 
produced 
and 
delivered 
would 
inherently 
increase 
pluralism 
and 
transparency 
in 
sectoral 
governance, 
and 
thus 
improve 
overall 
effectiveness and 
allocative efficiency. 
Indeed, the 
health 
system 
governance 
in 
Indonesia 
has 
traditionally 
been technocratic 
and 
highly 
centralized, 
with 
very 
little 
input 
from 
other 
stakeholders, 
thus 
not 
responsive 
to 
their 
needs 
and 
preferences.  Others argue 
that 
decentralization 
is 
not 
a 
panacea, 
and 
it 
could 
be counter-productive 
if 
new 
responsibilities 
are 
not 
matched 
with 
equal 
privileges and 
if 
local 
management 
capacity 
is 
not 
strengthened. 
The 
challenge, 
therefore, 
is 
to 
capitalize 
on 
the 
opportunities 
that 
decentralization offers 
while 
avoiding or alleviating 
the 
risks 
that 
it 
may 
entail. 
In 
Indonesia, 
there 
are 
two 
key 
opportunities inherently 
linked 
with 
decentralization: 
1. 
Moving 
away 
from 
a 
top-down 
and technocratic 
mode 
of 
policy 
making 
and 
regulation 
to 
a 
more pluralistic 
mode 
involving 
civil 
society 
and health 
care 
professionals 
while 
seizing the 
momentum 
to 
introduce 
and experiment 
with 
novel 
financing, 
management 
and 
service 
delivery 
models 
and 
mechanisms. 
This 
would 
entail: 
(i) 
laying 
the 
groundwork 
for 
tripartite 
health 
work 
force 
planning 
and 
management, 
including 
provincial/district 
health 
authorities, 
representatives 
of 
the 
medical 
professions 
and 
of 
the population/consumers; 
and 
(ii) 
setting 
up 
institutions 
and 
mechanisms 
for 
professional self-regulation and 
public 
oversight 
over 
ethical medical 
behavior and 
practice. 
2. 
Aligning 
the scope 
and 
mix 
of 
services 
to 
be produced 
locally 
in 
accordance 
with 
variations 
in 
health 
and 
health 
care 
needs 
across 
the 
country and 
the 
"purchasing 
power" 
of 
regional 
authorities. 
Burden 
of 
disease 
and 
inequalities 
in 
health 
and 
health care. 
Like 
many 
countries 
of 
South-East 
Asia 
in 
socioeconomic and 
epidemiological 
transition, Indonesia 
is 
facing 
the 
dual 
burden 
of 
communicable and non-communicable 
diseases. 
While 
health indicators 
in 
Indonesia have 
improved 
over 
the 
last 
20 
years, 
other countries achieved 
better health 
outcomes 
with 
the 
same 
level 
of 
public 
spending 
(e.g., 
the 
Philippines), 
or 
with 
less 
spending 
(e.g., 
China). 
Infant mortality 
rate 
(IMR: 
40.9 
per 
1000 
live 
births 
in 
2000), 
under-five 
mortality 
rate 
(USMR: 
51.4 per 
1000 
live 
births 
in 
2000) 
and 
maternal 
mortality ratio 
(MMR: 
470 per 
100,000 
live 
births 
in 
1995) 
remain 
over 
the 
regional 
average. 
While 
tuberculosis, 
malnutrition, 
malaria and 
anemia 
in 
pregnant 
women 
remain 
endemic, 
other 
problems 
related 
to 
changing 
lifestyles 
such 
as 
tobacco 
use, 
injuries 
and 
accidents, 
and 
HIV 
sero-positivity 
are 
on 
the 
rise. 
-5- 
Page  10
Despite 
considerable 
reductions over 
the 
last three 
decades, 
inequalities 
in 
health remain: 
national 
averages 
of 
infant mortality 
or 
under-five 
mortality hide 
a 
more 
complex 
picture 
with 
large 
variations 
across 
provinces, 
but 
most 
importantly 
between 
the 
rich 
and the 
poor: 
for 
instance 
the 
poorest/richest 
quintile ratio 
(p/r 
ratio) 
for 
infant mortality 
and under-five 
mortality 
rates 
are 3.4 
and 
3.7, 
respectively. 
Similar 
gradients 
exist 
by 
gender 
and 
area 
of 
residence. 
Inequalities 
in 
access 
to 
health 
care 
across 
different income 
groups 
are 
especially worrisome, 
though 
not 
surprising. 
First, 
Indonesia 
spends 
relatively 
less 
on 
health 
care, 
about 
1.8% 
of 
its 
GDP, 
or 
about 
US$17 
per capita (US$54 
in 
international 
dollars).  Indeed, 
Indonesia 
is 
one 
of 
the least endowed 
in 
the 
region 
in 
terms 
of 
physical 
and 
human 
resources 
for 
health 
care, 
with 
0.7 
bed 
per 
1,000 
population, 
and 
0.13 
physician 
and 
0.7 
nurse 
per 
1,000 
population, respectively. 
According 
to 
the baseline 
data 
collected 
in 
37 
districts 
in 
four 
provinces, 
in 
21 
districts 
ante-natal 
care coverage 
defined 
as 
four 
visits 
before delivery 
and 
birth 
attendance 
by 
skilled 
health 
staff remain 
below 
80%. 
The 
average 
number 
of 
physician visits 
remains 
below 
one 
per 
capita 
annually. 
At 
present, the 
problem 
of 
inequalities 
in 
health 
and health 
care 
is 
further 
compounded 
by 
the 
increase 
in 
high-risk 
behaviors 
(smolung, 
commercial 
sex, 
alcohol 
abuse, etc.), 
food 
insecurity 
and 
inadequate 
nutrition, 
especially 
amongst the 
poor, 
and 
by 
the 
decrease 
in 
government outlays 
and/or 
inter 
and 
intrasectoral allocations 
despite 
higher 
unit 
prices 
and 
unit 
costs 
of 
health 
services. 
Further, 
decreased demand 
for 
care, 
especially 
for 
private 
care, 
despite 
increasing 
needs 
is 
likely 
to 
worsen 
illness 
outcomes 
in 
terms 
of 
higher 
co-morbidity, 
severity and 
mortality 
as 
a 
result 
of 
reduced 
affordability 
of 
higher 
costs 
of 
drugs 
and 
medical 
care. 
Second, 
health 
spending 
is 
not 
equitable, 
and 
most 
importantly 
not 
well 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor. 
One 
study showed that almost 
40% 
of 
the 
subsidies 
benefit 
the 
richest 
30%, 
while 
30% 
assist 
the poorest 
40%, 
all 
this 
in 
an 
environment 
where 
75-80% 
of 
health 
expenditures 
are 
private, 
75% being 
out-of-pocket. 
Indeed, 
the wealthiest 
20% 
of 
the 
population 
were 
found 
to 
be 
3 and 
1.5 
times 
more 
likely 
to 
use 
inpatient and 
outpatient 
public 
health 
services, 
respectively,  than the poorest 20%. 
People, 
especially the poor, 
appear 
to 
have reduced 
the 
use 
of 
preventive health 
care and/or 
are 
delaying 
seeking 
care 
in 
case 
of 
illness, 
and/or 
resorting 
to 
self-treatment. 
The 
pooresth-ichest 
quintile 
ratio 
for 
immunization 
coverage 
stands at 
0.56, 
and 
at 
0.6 
for 
access 
to 
treatment 
of 
acute 
respiratory infections, 
0.08 
for 
ante-natal 
care 
visits 
to 
a 
doctor, 0.24 
for 
delivery 
attendance 
by 
medically 
trained 
person 
and 
0.8 
for 
use 
of 
modem 
contraceptives. 
Third 
is 
the 
under-utilization 
of 
public 
health 
services despite 
decades 
of 
continuous 
investment 
to 
expand geographic 
accessibility. 
A 
proponent and 
avid follower 
of 
the 
primary 
health 
care 
movement, 
Indonesia 
has 
over 
the last 
three 
decades 
endowed 
itself 
with 
a 
network 
of 
health facilities, 
from 
Jakarta 
to 
the remotest 
areas, 
by 
building 
more 
than 
7,000 
health 
centers 
(approximately 25% 
with 
beds), 
21,000 
sub-health centers 
and about 
240,000 
health 
posts. 
Yet, increased 
availability 
of 
health 
facilities 
has 
not 
resulted 
in 
increased 
utilization. 
The 
contact rate remains 
below 
30%. 
This 
infrastructure 
is 
complemented 
with 
some 
400 
public 
hospitals at 
all 
levels 
and 
numerous 
mobile 
health 
units. 
Nonetheless, there 
has 
been 
a 
steady 
decline 
in 
the 
bed/population 
ratio 
over 
the 
last 
decade, 
new 
investments 
not 
catching 
up 
with 
population growth 
and aging. 
More 
worrisome 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
those 
who 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
get 
sick 
and 
to 
have 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
recent economic 
crisis 
(the 
poor, 
fixed 
income, 
women 
and elderly) 
seem 
to 
have opted 
for 
self-treatment instead 
of 
using 
public 
health 
services 
despite 
reduced 
disposable 
income, 
a 
sign 
of 
lack 
of 
confidence 
in, 
or 
satisfaction 
with 
public 
health 
services, 
and 
perceived 
low 
quality. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, the 
wealthier and the better 
insured 
seek 
health 
care abroad: 
according 
to 
a 
new 
study 
on 
private 
health 
care 
in 
Indonesia, 
in 
2000 
approximately 
160,000 
patients 
received 
care 
overseas 
at 
an 
estimated 
cost 
of 
US$300 
million, 
more 
than the 
total public 
health 
budget 
for 
that 
year. 
This 
may 
also 
be 
partly 
due 
to 
limited 
development 
of 
the 
capital intensive 
privately 
provided 
inpatient 
care, 
due 
to 
a 
number 
of 
reasons 
including 
lack 
of 
financial 
incentives, 
lack 
of 
risk 
pooling 
through 
private 
insurance, 
high 
taxation 
and 
affordability.

Many 
of 
the health 
sector 
issues, 
such 
as 
unsustainable 
public 
health 
financing 
and inefficiencies 
in 
service 
provision 
mostly 
stem 
from 
the 
structural and organizational 
issues 
that 
have 
for 
long 
compromised 
system performance. 
The 
latter included: 
(i) 
full-scale 
commitment 
to 
developing 
a 
normative primary 
health 
care 
network without 
enough 
innovation, 
small-scale 
experimentation 
and 
adaptation 
through 
trial 
and 
error; 
(ii) 
too 
much 
reliance 
on 
putting 
together the hardware, 
with 
less 
emphasis 
on 
institutional 
mechanisms 
and 
"software"; 
(iii) 
chronic under-funding 
of 
government 
health 
services; 
(iv) 
allowance 
for 
part-time private 
practice 
of 
salaried 
health 
professionals 
on 
government 
payroll; 
(v) 
top-down planning 
and 
budgeting, 
partly 
because 
of 
lack 
of 
skills 
and 
competence 
at 
lower 
levels; and 
(vi) 
high 
degree 
of 
reliance 
on 
uniformly-applied, normative 
and 
rigid 
service 
delivery 
procedures/algorithms 
with 
limited flexibility 
for 
local 
tailoring. 
Health 
workforce 
deployment: 
skills 
mix and 
distribution 
of 
doctors, midwives and 
nurses. 
There 
are 
approximately 
44,000 
doctors 
in 
Indonesia, 
including 
some 
9,000 specialists, 
or 
about one 
doctor 
per 
6,000 
to 
7,000 
population. 
More 
than 
80% 
of 
graduates 
are 
absorbed 
by 
the 
PTT 
program, a 
three-year 
compulsory contractual 
arrangement 
whereby 
new 
doctors 
are 
assigned 
for 
practice 
in 
a 
primary 
health 
care 
setting. 
Salaries 
paid 
varied 
considerably 
according 
to 
locale, 
but 
they were 
in 
general 
very 
low. 
Since 
decentralization, 
salaries 
are 
higher 
but 
continue 
to 
depend 
on 
locales. 
In 
Jakarta 
a 
physician 
receives 
Rp 
1.5 
million 
monthly, 
in 
Jambi 
Rp 
1.2-1.3 
million, 
in 
Kalimantan 
Rp 
2-2.5 
million. 
Despite 
the 
PTT 
policy, 
many 
remote 
localities remain 
under 
serviced, 
with 
less 
than 
one 
physician per 
puskesmas. 
The 
realities 
of 
remote 
practice 
can 
be 
onerous: 
on-call responsibility 
- 
often 
24 
hours, 
seven 
days 
a week that can 
lead 
to 
bum 
out; 
an 
inadequate 
environment 
for 
service 
delivery 
including 
inadequate 
diagnostic and treatment equipment 
relevant 
to 
local 
population 
needs; 
isolation 
and 
insufficient 
access 
to 
other 
general 
practice 
doctors; 
lack 
of 
specialist 
services 
and 
long 
distances 
and 
inadequate 
transportation 
to 
a 
referral 
center; 
and restricted 
mobility 
during 
personal time, 
poor 
living 
conditions 
and 
social 
amenities. 
While PTT 
doctors 
are 
allowed 
to 
supplement 
their 
salary 
income 
by 
seeing patients 
during 
off-hours 
in 
their 
private 
practice, 
the 
practice 
increases 
workload, 
distorts equity 
- 
especially 
in 
communities 
with 
high 
poverty 
levels, 
limits 
additional income 
doctors 
can earn, 
and 
does 
not 
address 
the 
non-financial 
issues 
that 
equally affect physician 
morale, 
motivation 
and 
desire 
to 
serve 
in 
remote 
areas. 
The 
competence, 
quality 
and 
status 
of 
first-line 
health 
service 
workers 
are 
critical.  The 
ratio 
of 
General 
Practice 
(GP) 
doctors 
to 
specialists 
in 
Indonesia 
is 
about 
four to 
one. 
GPs 
have 
ill-defined 
roles 
that 
seem 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
situation. 
In 
health 
centers 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
assume 
the 
role 
of 
a 
primary 
health 
care 
team 
leader, 
but 
typically 
spend 
most 
of 
their time 
on 
administrative work. 
In 
hospitals, they 
may be 
left 
alone 
to 
do 
nothing more 
than 
triage, 
or 
be required 
to 
cover 
for 
or 
even 
replace specialty 
doctors. 
Their 
training 
does 
not 
equip 
them 
well 
for 
any 
of 
these 
tasks. 
Nurses 
and 
midwives 
seem 
to 
have a 
more active practice 
than general 
practitioners 
(although 
nurses 
do not 
have 
license 
to 
practice). 
Health 
facilities 
are 
staffed 
by 
nursing 
and 
midwifery 
personnel 
trained 
mainly below 
university 
level. 
Sixty 
percent 
of 
the 
nursing 
work 
force 
comprises 
vocational 
level 
nurses 
with 
three 
years 
of 
training 
post 
junior 
high 
school. 
This 
vocational 
level 
was 
initiated 
in 
1975 
and 
is 
now 
being 
curtailed.  The 
remaining 40% 
of 
nurses 
- 
and 
significantly 
fewer 
midwives 
- 
graduated 
with 
a 
three-year 
diploma 
post 
high 
school and 
at the 
baccalaureate 
level. 
The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
midwives 
(96%) 
are 
trained 
at 
a 
one-year 
diploma 
level 
and almost 
4% 
are 
trained 
at 
the three-year 
diploma, 
professional 
midwife 
level. 
Health 
workforce 
production. 
In 
Indonesia, 
there 
are 15 
publicly 
and 
25 
privately 
financed 
medical 
schools, 
producing 
approximately 
2,500 
doctors and 
training 
around 
500 
specialists 
in 
some 
24 
specialties 
every 
year.  Student 
fees 
comprise most 
of 
the costs 
of 
under-graduate 
education and 
post-graduate 
residency 
training. 
Nonetheless, despite 
its 
limited 
resources, 
GO1 
still 
spends 
around 
US$13,000 
per 
student 
enrolled 
in 
public 
medical 
schools, 
and 
about 
US$2,000 
for 
those 
in 
private 
-7- 
Page  12
medical 
schools. 
Tuition 
fees 
for 
medical 
education 
range 
from 
about 
Rp 
18 
- 
65 
million for 
the 
combined 
four-year education 
in 
basic 
medical 
sciences 
and 
two-year 
clinical 
training, 
depending 
on 
whether 
the 
training institution 
is 
public 
or 
private. 
At 
present, there 
exists 
little 
cooperation between the 
Faculties 
of 
Medicine 
and 
MONE 
which 
are the ‘producers’ 
of 
health 
professionals and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Provincial Health 
Departments 
which 
are 
the ‘consumers’ 
of 
those 
professionals.  Undergraduate 
medical 
education 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
separate 
components: an academic 
one 
(pre-clinical) 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
MONE 
and delivered 
by 
basic 
sciences 
departments 
and a 
professional 
one 
(clinical) 
under the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
provided 
by 
specialists.  Post-graduate 
education 
or 
specialty 
training 
is 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
professional 
associations. 
Until 
recently, 
the 
Consortium 
of 
Health 
Sciences (CHS), composed 
of 
representatives 
of 
MONE, 
MOH, 
IMA 
and 
Faculties 
of 
Medicine, had 
a 
role 
in 
designing, 
implementing 
and 
monitoring medical curricula 
and 
programs. 
A 
joint 
MONE-MOH 
decree 
in 
March 
2001 
dismantled 
the 
Consortium 
of 
Health 
Sciences, 
and 
delegated 
medical 
education 
to 
the 
Indonesian 
Medical 
Association 
and 
the 
Professional Associations 
of 
Specialists 
who 
now 
exert considerable 
influence 
on 
training 
of 
undergraduate 
medical 
students. 
The 
future 
Medical 
Council 
- 
a 
draft 
law 
is 
before 
the 
Parliament, 
albeit for quite 
a 
while 
-- 
is 
expected 
to 
put 
in 
place 
adequate mechanisms 
to 
assure 
better 
communication between 
these 
stakeholders. 
Until 
recently, 
graduates 
from 
privately-financed 
medical 
schools 
had 
to 
sit 
through national 
examinations 
conducted 
by 
a 
publicly-financed medical 
school 
to 
obtain 
a license 
to 
practice. 
This 
policy 
was 
deemed 
unfair 
by 
some 
private 
medical 
schools 
where 
under-graduate 
training 
is 
longer 
and/or 
more 
stringent 
than 
their 
public 
equivalents, and 
the 
requirement increased 
the 
workload 
and 
stretched 
the 
capacity 
of 
public 
medical 
schools, 
creating 
long 
waiting 
times 
and reports 
of 
unethical 
practices 
in 
scheduling and 
tahng 
individual 
exams. 
However, 
the 
decision 
to 
remove 
the 
requirement 
left 
Indonesia 
without 
any 
national 
examination mechanism 
for 
ensuring 
a 
common 
standard 
for 
undergraduate 
medical 
education.  Since 
public 
universities, 
with 
their medical 
schools, 
are 
moving 
toward 
autonomous 
board 
governance 
status, 
and 
private universities 
already have 
such 
status, 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
national 
examination 
to 
certify 
the 
competence 
of 
new 
graduates 
is 
a 
major 
stumbling 
block 
in 
assuring 
standardization 
in 
medical 
education and 
licensing. 
Residency 
toward 
a specialist 
degree 
typically 
requires 
seven 
or 
eight 
semesters 
of 
further 
training 
conducted 
at 
university 
teaching hospitals 
with 
input 
from 
the 
relevant 
Medical 
College 
of 
Specialists. 
The 
fees 
are 
estimated 
to 
amount 
approximately 
Rp 
28-32 
million, 
but 
is 
markedly 
higher 
in 
more 
prestigious 
settings 
and 
for 
more 
coveted 
specialties. 
By 
decree, 
certification 
is 
awarded 
by 
the 
Colleges 
of 
Associations 
of 
Specialists. 
Despite 
high 
tuition 
fees, 
the requirement 
for 
compulsory 
service 
in 
remote 
areas, 
relatively 
modest 
official 
salaries 
of 
doctors and 
low 
prospects 
for 
specialty 
training, 
the demand 
for 
medical 
school 
education 
appears 
strong. 
To 
be 
a 
GP, 
and 
more 
so, 
to 
hold 
a 
speciality 
designation, remains 
socially 
and 
economically 
valuable. 
The 
MONE 
is 
constantly 
pressed 
to 
approve 
the 
development 
of 
new 
medical 
schools. 
The 
establishment 
of 
medical 
schools 
is 
a 
major 
undertaking 
that 
requires 
extensive investment 
in 
human 
as 
well 
as 
physical 
resources. 
However, 
investments can 
only 
be 
effective 
if 
they 
are 
accompanied 
by 
a 
nation-wide 
effort 
to 
regulate and 
assure 
quality 
of 
production 
of 
doctors through 
improved 
quality 
of training, 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
content and 
methodology, 
more 
stringent 
regulation 
of 
the 
medical 
profession that 
would 
require 
closer 
collaboration between 
MOH, 
MONE 
and 
IMA. 
The health workforce 
issues 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
for 
all 
health 
workers, 
not 
just 
for 
doctors, 
midwives 
and 
nurses. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
the 
full 
range 
of 
health 
workers 
is 
treated affects 
the 
-8- 
Page  13
performance 
of 
the 
sector 
and the 
ability 
of 
its 
workers 
to effectively 
treat 
and 
care 
for 
patients. 
In 
addition, 
strengthening capacity 
for 
human 
resource management 
in 
health 
needs 
to 
be 
linked 
with 
wider 
civil 
service 
reforms.  Reforms 
in 
health 
sector 
personnel 
administration require 
linkage 
to 
the 
larger 
context 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
civil 
service 
as 
a 
whole 
if 
they 
are 
to 
be 
acceptable. 
The 
MENPAN 
(civil 
reform 
initiatives) 
has 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
characterizing 
the 
personnel 
administration 
system 
in 
government, 
and 
proposed a 
framework 
for 
reforming 
the 
government-wide 
civil 
service personnel 
system 
in 
the 
context 
of 
decentralization 
which 
is 
applicable 
to 
the 
health 
sector. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
however, 
there 
is 
an 
urgent need 
to 
increase 
both 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
medical 
doctors 
given 
the 
current 
shortage, the 
inequalities 
in 
their distribution, 
and the 
increasing number 
of 
medical 
faculties 
and 
the 
demands 
for 
establishing 
more 
since the onset 
of 
decentralization. 
Government strategy. 
In 
1999 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
has 
approved a 
new 
long 
term 
health 
strategy, 
"Healthy 
Indonesia 
2010" 
based 
on 
four pillars 
for 
national health 
development: 
(i) 
the 
"healthy 
paradigm" 
reflecting 
a broader understanding 
of 
health 
and 
emphasizing health promotion; 
(ii) 
"professionalism", focusing 
entirely 
on 
human 
resources 
development; 
(iii) 
Community 
Managed 
Health 
Care 
Program 
(JPKM) 
and 
what 
is 
needed 
to 
lay 
the 
legal groundwork 
and 
adequate 
funding; 
and 
(iv) 
decentralization, 
particularly 
definition 
of 
boundaries, management 
guidelines and 
the associated 
human 
resource 
policies. 
Since the 
onset 
of 
decentralization, 
MOH 
has 
begun 
the 
process 
of 
self-adjustment, 
or 
more 
specifically, 
of 
redefining 
its 
key 
responsibilities 
which 
will 
include: 
(i) 
developing 
overall 
sectoral 
mission 
and 
vision; 
(ii) 
building 
up 
its 
advisory and 
technical capacity 
for 
support 
to 
provinces and 
districts; 
(iii) 
monitoring 
and safeguarding 
inter-regional equity 
in 
health 
financing 
and adequate 
funding 
of 
essential 
health 
services; 
(iv) quality 
assurance 
and 
control 
through regulation; 
and 
(v) 
surveillance, 
prevention 
and 
control 
of 
communicable 
diseases 
and 
food 
and 
drug 
safety. 
Understandably, 
such 
a 
major 
change 
in 
responsibilities 
brings 
along 
major 
institutional 
changes 
and restructuring. 
Key 
changes 
include: 
(i) 
closure 
of 
provincial 
and 
district 
MOH 
offices; 
(ii) 
establishment 
of 
a 
new 
autonomous 
agency 
for food 
and 
drug 
control; 
and 
(iii) 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
Decentralization 
Unit 
to 
strengthen 
its 
technical 
and managerial support 
to 
provinces and districts, 
and 
to 
define 
performance 
indicators 
and 
minimum 
service 
delivery 
standards. 
As 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education, 
two 
strategies 
need 
to 
be 
emphasized, 
both 
structural 
and 
in 
relation 
of 
redefining 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
MONE, 
IMA 
and 
the 
Universities. 
First 
is 
the 
intent to 
pursue self-govemance 
of 
Universities 
beyond 
the 
experimental 
phase whereby 
six 
universities 
were 
given 
autonomous 
status. 
Second, 
is 
the 
increased delegation 
of 
matters 
related 
to 
medical 
education 
to 
IMA, 
and 
its 
constituent 
organs. 
Hence the 
Collegium 
of 
Medical 
Doctors, 
set 
up 
under 
IMA 
in 
2001, 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
designing, 
implementing 
and evaluating 
the 
new internship 
program 
for 
primary 
care 
physicians, 
and 
of 
setting 
up 
the 
national medical 
education 
for 
new 
graduates. 
In 
addition 
there 
are 
several 
reform 
attempts, 
all 
toward 
improved quality 
of 
under-graduate 
and 
graduate 
medical 
education 
such 
as 
program-based 
learning 
for 
improved 
critical clinical 
skdls 
and 
practice 
and 
standardized admission and 
licensing 
examinations.

Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
obvious place 
to 
start 
is 
by 
improving 
health 
facilities 
where 
health 
sector 
workers 
provide 
treatment 
and 
care: 
from 
small 
rural 
puskesmas, 
to district 
and 
provincial 
hospitals. 
The 
reality 
is 
that 
buildings 
and 
equipment alone 
do 
not provide 
treatment and 
care 
- 
people 
do. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt that 
investment 
in 
physical 
capital 
is 
required 
in 
many 
places. 
But 
treatment 
and 
care 
itself 
is 
problematic. 
Infant 
and 
maternal 
mortality 
rates 
in 
Indonesia 
remain 
very 
high 
because 
there 
is 
limited 
access 
to quality 
services 
from 
health 
professionals. 
Most 
maternal 
deaths 
occur 
in 
hospitals, 
not 
in 
the village. 
GPs have 
limited 
training 
and 
competency 
to 
manage 
obstetric 
emergency 
cases. 
Most 
of 
the 
sick children 
are 
seen 
and 
treated 
by 
nurses 
who 
are 
not 
trained 
to 
diagnose 
and 
give 
prescriptions. 
The 
training 
and 
legally 
mandated 
division 
of 
professional responsibilities 
and 
coordination 
of 
service 
provision 
between 
doctors, 
midwives 
and 
nurses 
is 
very 
important 
for 
quality 
patient 
care, 
notably 
in 
integrated maternal 
and 
child 
healthcare 
services. 
The training 
of 
health 
professionals 
needs 
significant modernization and 
strengthening, 
and central 
and 
local 
authorities and 
professional 
bodies have 
inadequate 
capacity 
to 
manage 
their 
health 
work 
force 
in 
the interest 
of 
better 
care. 
With 
or 
without improved 
facilities 
and 
new 
equipment, 
what 
truly 
makes 
a 
difference 
is 
the 
knowledge and 
experience 
health 
workers 
bring 
to 
their 
patients, 
how 
they relate 
to 
them, 
their 
clinical 
practice 
methods 
and 
procedures, 
how 
their 
work 
is 
organized 
within 
and 
across 
health 
disciplines, 
how 
they 
are 
paid, 
how 
they 
are 
treated 
as 
employees 
and 
professionals, 
how 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
services 
is 
ensured 
and 
how 
errors and mistakes 
are 
handled, 
how 
they 
advance 
their 
knowledge and professional 
interests 
while 
protecting 
the 
public 
interest, and 
how 
all 
health 
professionals 
are 
produced, 
organized and 
managed 
in 
Indonesian 
society. 
Without priority 
investments that 
address 
these 
major 
human 
capital 
issues, 
investment 
in 
buildings 
and equipment alone 
will 
not 
improve 
health. 
They 
will 
only 
generate 
monuments that 
remind 
local 
communities and their 
elected 
officials 
of 
their 
failure 
to 
improve 
health 
status, 
treatment 
and 
care, 
and burden 
taxpayers 
with 
ongoing 
and 
future 
operating cost 
obligations 
that 
benefit 
providers rather 
than 
consumers 
of 
care. 
There 
is 
much to 
be 
done 
to 
achieve the 
vision 
of 
Healthy 
Indonesia 
2010. 
For 
many, the 
most 
As 
its 
predecessors 
Provincial 
Health 
Projects 
I 
(PHP-I) 
and 
11 
(PHP-II), 
this 
project 
is 
set 
to 
make 
health 
sector 
decentralization 
successful 
and 
sustainable, 
institutionally 
and 
financially. 
Particularly important 
is 
to 
avoid 
any shortage 
of 
funds 
and 
disruption 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
the 
primary 
health 
care 
and 
public 
health 
services, 
including 
communicable 
disease 
control. 
It 
also 
attempts 
to 
seize 
the 
opportunity provided 
by 
decentralization 
to 
strengthen 
regional 
governance. 
This 
will 
include 
new 
planning 
and 
management mechanisms 
and 
tools, 
but 
also 
new 
institutions 
to 
increase transparency 
and 
client 
involvement. 
Among key 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
are: 
(i) 
enhancing 
performance and 
effectiveness 
of 
local 
health 
services; 
(ii) 
meeting 
the 
newly 
emerging 
work 
force and 
training 
needs 
at 
the 
local 
level; 
(iii) 
doing 
away 
with 
normative and prescriptive 
system 
authority 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
more pluralistic 
and 
demand-driven mode 
of 
decision 
malung 
and 
management; 
and 
(iv) continuing 
and 
improving 
on 
various 
innovative 
practices 
such 
as 
the 
Jamkesnas, 
contract-based 
hiring 
of 
doctors, 
health 
cards 
for 
the poor, 
clinical 
algorithms, deconcentration 
of 
spending 
responsibilities, improvement 
of 
health 
information 
system, 
and 
training 
and 
health 
education. 
The 
key 
sectoral 
issues 
with 
implications 
across 
the three 
levels 
of 
governance are 
human 
resources 
development 
and 
sustainable 
financing. 
A 
revision 
of 
the 
human 
resources 
development 
policy 
governing 
doctors, 
nurses 
and midwives, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
civil 
reform 
initiatives 
is 
one 
component. 
Another 
is 
the 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Medical 
Council 
to 
regulate 
medical 
practice, a 
college 
of 
family 
doctors 
for 
certification, 
and/or 
realignment 
of 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
existing 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
new 
Collegium 
under 
JMA 
that 
has 
replaced 
the 
Consortium 
of 
Medical 
Sciences. 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a need 
to 
critically 
review 
the 
whole 
process 
of 
medical 
education 
from 
entry to 
post-graduate 
practice, and 
identify 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
its 
various 
determinants, 
financial or 
otherwise, 
to 
determine 
the 
key 
factors 
amenable 
to 
policy 
change 
and 
intervention. 
This 
would 
require 
- 
10- 
Page  15
focusing 
on: 
(i) 
the 
input, 
or 
the 
selection 
process; 
(ii) 
throughput, 
or medical 
education 
program 
management 
and 
its 
components 
(faculty, 
curriculum, 
teaching methods and the infrastructure); 
(iii) 
output, 
or board 
examination 
and licensing; and 
(iv) 
management 
of 
the 
teaching institutions 
themselves, 
including 
research 
as 
an 
integrated 
activity. 
As 
for 
health financing, 
the 
project 
will 
explore, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
JPKM 
model 
advocated 
by 
Healthy 
Indonesia, other 
options 
such 
as 
community-based 
and 
voluntary health 
insurance, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
more 
recent 
national health 
insurance 
initiatives. 
Last 
but 
not 
least, 
is 
to 
help 
the 
sector 
to 
find 
the 
right 
balance 
in 
the 
division 
of 
responsibilities 
across 
the 
three 
levels 
of 
governance, and 
to 
endow 
them 
accordingly 
with 
the 
right 
mix 
of 
human, 
physical 
and 
financial 
resources 
and 
the mechanisms 
to 
implement 
a 
fluid 
interface 
in 
terms 
of 
advocacy, 
technical 
assistance 
and 
information. 
For 
instance, 
it 
is 
particularly 
important, 
given 
the 
existing 
laws, 
that 
an 
adequate 
role for 
the 
provincial level 
be defined 
where economies 
of 
scale 
are 
particularly 
promising 
for 
regulation and 
quality control 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
food 
hygiene, 
communicable 
disease 
control, health 
education, 
training, 
information 
management 
and 
health 
work 
force 
policy 
and planning.

Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown) 
: 
Kalimantan, 
West 
Kalimantan, 
and West 
Sumatera.  These 
provinces 
are 
interested 
in 
alleviating 
the 
financial 
and 
managerial 
uncertainties 
of 
the 
ongoing decentralization 
process, 
and 
in 
seizing 
the 
emerging opportunities 
for 
sustainable 
health 
care 
financing 
and equitable 
access 
to 
higher 
quality 
of 
care.  Therefore, 
this 
project 
intends 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
in 
selected 
provinces through 
institutional 
support, 
and 
increased 
investment 
in 
health 
financing 
and 
human 
resources. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
will 
build 
on PHP-I 
and 
PHP-II 
underway 
in 
other 
provinces 
while 
adding 
a 
new 
component 
of 
human 
resources 
development. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
project 
will 
have 
three 
components, each 
applicable 
to 
all 
three 
levels 
of 
governance: 
(i) 
improved 
health 
system 
stewardship, 
including policy 
and 
planning, 
management 
and system 
regulation; 
(ii) 
sustained 
and expanded 
health 
services 
financing 
and delivery; 
and 
(iii) 
strengthened 
health 
workforce policy, 
management 
and 
training. 
This 
combined 
platform 
will 
be 
used 
to improve 
health 
workforce quality 
and 
effectiveness 
as 
well 
as 
to 
address 
service 
delivery 
and resource 
mobilization 
issues.

project's 
components

3. 
Benefits 
and 
target population: 
in 
47 
districts and cities 
in 
four 
provinces 
by 
improving 
the 
availability 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
and 
by 
making them 
socio-culturally, 
geographically, 
organizationally and 
financially more 
accessible 
to 
the people. 
It 
will 
also 
benefit 
current 
and 
future 
health 
care 
providers through 
new 
and 
improved 
training 
opportunities 
and 
updated 
recruitment, 
retention and 
personnel 
management 
policies 
and 
practices, 
including financial 
and 
career 
incentive 
schemes. 
In 
addition, 
it 
will 
benefit medical 
students 
and faculties through 
improved 
management 
of 
medical 
faculties, 
improved training 
of 
new 
medical 
graduates 
and 
post-graduates 
and 
development 
of 
skills 
to 
use 
new 
communication 
and 
information 
technologies. 
Finally 
it 
will 
benefit 
the 
whole 
sector 
through 
increased 
allocational 
and 
technical 
efficiency 
by 
institutionalizing 
a 
pluralistic 
mode 
of 
system stewardship and 
management. 
Primarily, 
the 
project 
will 
benefit 
some 
13.7 
million 
residents, 
including 
the three 
million 
poor,

Institutional 
and 
implementation arrangements: 
be 
implemented 
during 
the 
first 
year 
at 
district, 
provincial 
and central 
levels were 
identified 
during 
project 
preparation and 
confirmed 
at 
Appraisal. 
Thereafter, 
all 
activities 
will 
be 
based 
on 
plans 
developed and approved annually 
by 
regional 
authorities 
as 
follows: 
Components 
A 
and 
B 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be implemented 
by 
district 
and 
provincial 
health offices 
(Dinas 
Kesehatan), 
respectively, under 
the 
overall direction 
and oversight 
of 
District 
Health 
Councils (DHC), Joint 
Health 
Councils 
(JHC), 
and 
Technical Review 
Teams 
(TRT). 
The 
funding 
mechanism 
to 
be 
used 
at 
the 
district 
level 
will 
be 
block 
funding 
through 
District 
Funding 
Allocations. 
Component C 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
central 
MOH 
and 
MONE 
in 
partnership 
with 
IMA, 
and 
under guidance 
and oversight 
of 
an 
Inter 
Agency 
Coordinating 
Committee 
(IACC) 
and a 
Technical 
Review 
Committee 
(TRC). 
See 
Annex 
2, 
Attachments 
2-3 
for 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the management 
structure 
for 
project 
activities 
at the 
district, 
provincial 
and central 
levels, 
and 
a 
project 
management 
organizational 
chart. 
Project coordination 
will 
be 
similar to 
that 
in 
PHP-I 
and 
PHP-II. 
A 
Central 
Project 
Coordinating 
Unit 
will 
be 
established 
in 
MOH 
(CPCU-MOH), 
and 
headed 
by 
a 
full-time 
Executive 
Secretary. 
Its 
main 
role 
will 
be implementation 
of 
the 
MOH 
components, and 
coordination 
of 
all 
activities 
across central, 
provincial, 
and 
district 
levels. 
A 
sub-coordination 
unit 
will 
be 
established 
in 
MONE 
(CPCU-MONE), 
headed 
by 
a 
Project Coordinator, 
to 
ensure 
proper 
project 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
MONE 
component. 
Staffing 
of 
both 
CPCUs 
include 
a 
planning officer, 
a procurement specialist, a 
financial 
officer,  and a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
officer.  The 
CPCUs 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
procurement, 
disbursement, 
and 
accounting 
for 
the central level, 
but 
will 
also oversee 
and 
coordinate 
project 
implementation 
by 
Provincial Coordination 
and 
Implementation 
Units 
(PCIU)  and 
District 
Implementation 
Units 
(DIU). 
Project launch 
is 
expected 
to begin 
in 
September 2003, 
and last 
for 
five 
years. 
The 
activities 
to 
Project implementation 
will 
be guided 
by 
a 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
(PMM) 
detailing 
procurement and 
financial 
management, 
while 
implementation 
of 
the 
DFA 
will 
follow 
the 
District 
Funding 
Allocation Manual 
(see 
Annex 
2, 
Attachments 
4-6 
for 
the 
DFA 
preparation 
and 
approval 
process chart, 
DFA 
manual outline, 
and a 
detailed description 
of 
the 
criteria 
that 
districts 
will 
use 
to 
prepare proposals 
for 
funding). 
At 
the 
moment, 
GO1 
has 
two 
options 
for 
channeling 
project 
funds 
to 
the 
district, 
i.e., 
either 
through 
the 
provinces, 
or directly 
to 
the 
districts.  Channeling 
funds 
through the 
provincial level 
will 
allow for 
stronger supervision 
of 
project 
implementation 
as 
the 
province 
will 
be 
able 
to 
transfer 
money 
to 
the 
district 
level 
in 
tranches, based 
on 
physical 
progress 
and 
cash 
flow 
requirements 
as 
indicated 
in 
the 
Project 
Management 
Report (PMR). 
For 
activities 
at 
the 
provincial 
and 
central 
levels, 
the 
PCIUs 
and 
CPCUs 
will 
provide 
financial, 
procurement, and 
implementation 
reports 
according 
to 
the agreed 
PMR 
format and 
with 
the 
same 
schedule 
as 
detailed 
in 
the 
Project 
Management 
Manual.  The 
CPCUs 
will 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
compiling 
all 
PMRs 
for 
submission 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
State 
Audit 
Authority 
(BPKP) 
will 
conduct 
an 
annual 
financial 
and implementation audit.

Annual 
Planning 
and Budgeting. 
District Level 
District 
master 
plans 
have been 
prepared 
during 
project 
preparation. 
The 
plans 
are 
based 
on 
comprehensive 
situation 
analyses 
covering 
community 
health 
status, 
existing 
inputs 
for 
service delivery, 
public 
health 
problems, 
and 
public 
as 
well 
as 
private 
sector response 
to 
existing 
health 
problems. 
These 
master plans 
will 
be 
updated 
each 
year, 
and 
will 
be 
submitted 
for 
review along 
with 
yearly detailed 
work 
plans. 
The 
work 
plan 
will 
document 
all 
health interventions 
in 
the 
district 
in 
a 
particular 
year 
listing 
all 
funding 
sources. 
It 
was 
agreed 
during 
Negotiations 
that 
the 
annual 
budget 
allocation 
for 
health 
will 
follow 
a 
financing 
plan 
designed 
to 
reach 
Rp 
51,000 
per 
capita 
in 
year 
2002 
prices, 
or 
15% 
of 
the 
total 
APBD 
(local 
Government 
funds) 
of 
the 
district, 
excluding 
the 
resources 
allocated 
for 
civil 
works 
and 
equipment, 
as 
per 
the 
agreement 
in 
principle 
between 
MOH 
and 
the 
regions. 
The 
District 
Health 
Office 
will 
coordinate 
the 
work 
of 
the districts 
in 
proposal 
development, 
and, 
upon 
approval 
by 
the 
DHC, 
will 
submit 
the 
proposal 
via 
the 
DIU 
and the 
PCIU 
to 
the 
JHC. 
The 
TRT 
will 
review 
the 
suitability 
of 
the proposals 
and 
will 
prepare an 
executive 
summary 
of 
its 
findings 
for 
JHC’s 
consideration. 
After 
the 
JHC 
gives 
its 
approval 
to 
the proposals, the 
PCIU 
will 
send the proposals 
to 
the 
Bank 
for final 
approval. 
The 
whole 
process 
will 
be 
elaborated 
in 
detail 
in 
the 
District 
Funding 
Allocation 
Manual, 
including 
careful 
timing 
to 
ensure 
that the 
process meets 
GOI’s 
time 
frame 
for 
DIP 
preparation. 
Provincial 
Level 
The 
provinces 
and 
the center 
will 
prepare 
their 
annual 
plan 
according 
to 
the schedule 
prepared 
by 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Planning, 
MOH. 
The 
provincial 
planning 
unit 
will 
work 
with 
the 
PCIU 
to 
coordinate 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
provincial 
proposal. 
The proposal 
will 
reflect 
support 
to 
district 
level 
activities. 
Moreover, 
it 
will 
include 
activities 
that 
because 
of 
economies 
of 
scale and/or 
the 
systemic 
nature 
of 
the 
activities should be implemented 
at 
the 
provincial 
rather than the 
district 
level. 
The 
provincial 
proposal 
is 
subject 
to 
approval 
by 
the JHC. 
Central 
Level 
Central 
implementing 
units 
within 
MOH 
(including 
MA) 
and 
MONE 
will 
prepare 
their 
annual 
plans 
and 
will 
submit 
the 
plans 
via 
the 
CPCU to 
the 
TRC for 
review 
and comments. 
Based 
on 
the 
TRC 
inputs, 
IACC 
will 
then approve 
the 
central 
plans.

As 
described 
above, 
financial 
management, 
procurement and disbursement 
responsibilities 
will 
be 
integrated 
at 
district, 
provincial 
and 
central 
levels depending 
on 
the nature 
of 
project 
activities 
being 
implemented 
at 
the respective 
level. 
This 
structure 
for 
project implementation 
and 
management 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project 
which 
emphasizes 
capacity 
building 
of 
the 
MOH 
and 
MONE 
and other 
government 
agencies 
at 
different

The Indonesian 
Pilot 
for 
Enhanced Disclosure 
of 
Information 
being pursued 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
revised 
Information Disclosure Policy. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Banks 
revised 
disclosure 
policy, 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
were approached 
for 
piloting 
enhanced 
disclosure 
if 
the 
governments 
of 
these 
countries were interested 
in 
participating. 
During 
the 
CAS 
consultations 
and 
other 
discussions, 
both 
the 
GO1 
and 
civil 
society 
expressed 
keen interest 
in 
substantially 
greater 
access 
to 
information on 
Bank 
activities 
to 
allow 
full 
public 
discussion 
of 
project 
implementation 
and 
its 
findings 
in 
particular. 
An 
agreement 
has 
been 
reached 
to 
include 
Indonesia 
in 
the 
pilot for 
enhanced 
disclosure 
to 
enable 
civil 
society oversight 
leading to 
greater transparency 
and 
openness. 
The 
Pilot for 
enhanced 
information 
disclosure 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
revised Disclosure Policy, 
as 
per 
an 
agreement 
with 
BAPPENAS 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Borrower 
on 
an 
approach 
to 
enhanced 
information 
disclosure. 
This 
approach 
consists 
of 
the 
following 
arrangements: 
(a) 
Agreement 
on 
building 
disclosure 
of 
information 
during 
project 
preparation 
into 
project 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
a 
set 
of 
projects 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
initial 
phase 
of 
the 
pilot. 
This 
agreed 
set 
consists 
of 
four 
projects, 
including 
the 
proposed 
Health 
Workforce 
and 
Services 
Project. 
(The other 
three 
projects 
are 
the proposed 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Irrigation 
Sector 
Management 
Project, 
the proposed 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project, 
and 
the proposed 
Third 
Kecamaten 
Development 
Project.) 
Annex 
13 
provides 
for 
more detailed 
information on 
these 
arrangements. 
Specific 
issues 
that 
has 
been agreed 
upon 
regarding 
enhanced 
disclosure 
include: 
(i) 
final 
annual audit reports issued under 
pilot 
projects 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available 
by 
both 
the 
Borrower 
and 
the 
Bank: 
(ii) 
the 
mid-term 
reports 
of 
pilot 
projects 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available 
by 
the 
Borrower: 
and 
(iii) 
the 
procurement 
process, 
where the 
Borrower 
has 
agreed 
that 
additional 
information 
concerning 
parts 
of 
the procurement 
process 
in 
pilot 
projects 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available. 
The draft 
development 
credit 
agreement 
for 
the 
Health 
Workforce 
and 
Services 
Project 
includes specific 
undertalungs 
to 
effectuate 
these agreements. 
These 
undertakings 
would 
eliminate 
the 
need 
for 
GO1 
approval 
to 
be 
obtained 
prior 
to 
the 
public 
release 
of 
such 
information. 
(c) 
For 
documents 
other than 
those 
referred 
to 
in 
sub-paragraph 
(b) 
above 
which 
are 
currently 
not 
disclosed 
without 
Borrower 
consent 
the 
Bank 
will 
continue 
to 
consult 
GO1 
prior to 
disclosure 
of 
such documents. 
GO1 
may 
consider 
moving 
to 
a 
more 
general 
practice 
of 
automatic 
release 
of 
such documents 
after 
the 
Government 
completes 
its 
review 
of 
enhanced 
information 
disclosure 
concerning 
the 
public 
provisions 
of 
services 
that 
it 
is 
currently 
undertaking. 
In 
this 
regard the anti-corruption 
guide 
for 
task 
teams 
and 
the 
anti-corruption 
annex 
(13) 
based 
on 
this 
guide 
(together 
with 
the covenants 
on 
disclosure 
of 
audits, 
mid-term review 
report 
and procurement 
documents) 
are 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
the 
adoption 
of 
enhanced 
disclosure, and 
more 
open 
and 
transparent practices. 
Agreement 
to 
utilize 
an 
IDF 
grant 
to 
support 
activities 
for 
developing 
GO1 
policies 
for 
increased 
information 
disclosure under 
all 
government projects 
in 
Indonesia. 
A 
GO1 
implementation 
team 
has 
been established, 
and 
a 
Bank 
counterpart team 
has 
also been 
formed.  Start-up 
activities 
for 
administrative 
arrangements 
and preparation 
of 
terms 
of 
reference 
of 
consultants under 
this 
grant have been 
initiated.

The 
pilot 
will 
be 
reviewed after 
two 
years 
to 
lead 
to 
recommendations 
to improve upon 
Bank's 
disclosure 
policy. 
On-granting 
Arrangements. 
This 
project 
is 
considered 
by 
GO1 
as 
a 
non

A 
baseline survey 
was 
conducted 
during 
project 
preparation. 
The 
PIPS 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
project 
implementation, 
monitoring, and 
supervision. 
A 
list 
of 
outcome, 
output 
and 
input 
indicators 
have been 
prepared 
by 
all 
districts 
with 
their 
respective baseline 
values. 
The 
monitoring

evaluation 
officers 
of 
the 
DIUs, 
PCILJs, 
and CPCUs 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
monitoring 
and supervision 
activities. 
The 
project's 
implementation 
progress 
will 
be 
monitored 
through 
the semi-annual 
project

reports. 
These 
reports 
will 
contain 
essential 
data 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
components 
and 
sub-components, 
and 
additional 
analysis

information 
will 
be 
gathered 
through 
field 
visits 
during

of 
project 
objectives 
will 
also 
be 
assessed 
through 
a 
Mid-term 
Evaluation, 
to 
be 
carried out 
by 
June 
30,2006,  and 
through 
a

that 
will 
be produced 
by

Joint 
Project 
Supervision 
with 
PHP-II. 
The 
MOH 
has 
agreed 
to 
consider 
ways 
to 
enhance 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
PHPs 
with 
the 
HWS 
to 
increase 
both 
effectiveness and 
efficiency, 
and 
to 
better 
take 
stock 
of 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
previous 
projects. 
One 
option 
is 
to 
conduct supervision 
of 
HWS's 
central 
MOH 
level 
activities 
together 
with 
the 
joint 
PHP-I 
and 
PHP-11 
supervision 
missions. 
Another 
option 
is 
to 
broaden 
participation 
in 
the 
supervision 
workshops 
to include 
provincial 
representatives 
from 
all 
three 
projects 
to 
share 
experiences, 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
JHCs 
and 
TRTs, 
and 
the 
way 
and 
means 
district 
budgets are 
allocated through 
the 
provincial 
filter. 
Finally, 
stocktalung 
of 
progress 
with 
the 
institutionalization 
of 
annual plans 
and 
district 
funding 
allocations 
could be 
jointly 
reviewed 
to 
identify 
bottlenecks 
and 
how 
districts have 
been able 
to 
resolve 
operational 
issues. 
D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
1. 
Continue 
developing projects 
designed 
and 
implemented 
at 
the 
central 
level: 
This 
option 
is 
no 
longer viable 
for 
three 
main 
reasons: 
(i) 
there 
is 
no 
more 
a 
legitimate organizational and 
financing 
model which 
would 
allow 
top-down 
project 
design and 
implementation; 
(ii) 
decentralization 
seems 
to 
be 
tahng 
hold with 
consequent 
changes 
in 
the perceptions, attitudes and 
behavior 
of 
public 
authorities 
at 
all 
three levels 
of 
governance 
in 
terms 
of 
power 
sharing and 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
which 
will 
make 
it 
very 
difficult to 
implement 
center-driven 
projects; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
Bank 
has 
already 
moved 
away 
from 
center-driven 
project 
design 
and preparation 
with 
the 
most 
recent 
provincial 
health 
project framework 
and 
change 
of 
course 
at 
this 
stage 
will 
not 
be 
politically 
acceptable. 
2. 
Wait 
until 
"the 
dust 
settles": 
During 
the 
recent economic 
crisis 
it 
has 
become 
clear 
that 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
hard-pressed 
and 
unable 
to maintain 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
funding 
to 
provide health 
care 
services, 
let 
alone cover 
additional 
expenses 
brought 
about 
by 
decentralization, 
such 
as 
increased 
in-service 
training 
needs 
and 
loss 
of 
economies 
of 
scale due 
to 
duplication 
of 
some 
essential 
services 
at 
all 
levels. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
time 
to 
seize 
the 
momentum 
to: 
(i) 
introduce 
and 
experiment 
with 
novel 
policy 
development, 
financing, 
management 
and 
service 
delivery 
models and 
mechanisms; 
and 
(ii) 
redefine 
the 
scope 
and 
mix 
of 
services 
to 
be 
produced 
locally 
in 
accordance 
with 
variations 
in 
health and health 
care

needs 
across 
the 
country.  Decentralization 
has 
provided 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
to 
do 
away 
with 
top-down 
and 
technocratic mode 
of 
policy 
making 
and regulation, 
and 
to 
adopt a 
more pluralistic 
mode 
involving 
civil 
society and 
health 
care 
professionals. 
3. 
tuned 
to 
the 
training 
of 
health 
professionals, 
mainly 
physicians, 
it 
has 
become 
increasingly 
clear that 
capacity-building 
alone 
could not 
improve quality 
of 
health 
care 
if 
it 
is 
not 
accompanied 
with 
concurrent 
changes 
in 
the 
organizational 
models 
and 
incentive 
schemes. 
Further, the recent 
decentralization 
has 
added 
an 
additional 
necessity 
for 
revisiting existing institutional 
mechanisms 
and establishing 
new 
ones 
for 
long-term 
sustainability 
and 
maximum yield 
from 
capacity-building activities. 
Therefore, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
ongoing decentralization 
process, 
it 
was 
decided that 
the 
project 
scope 
be 
expanded 
to 
include 
the 
other 
two 
functions 
of 
health 
services management and 
delivery. 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
Central 
Component, 
however, 
is 
expected 
to 
accrue 
across 
Indonesia 
as 
it 
focuses 
on 
human 
resources 
development 
with 
nation-wide implications. 
Focus 
on 
and 
emphasize 
capacity 
building: 
While 
the 
original 
project 
concept 
was 
more 
4. 
other 
provincial 
health projects 
to 
increase the 
total 
number 
of 
provinces 
thus 
covered 
to 
nine. 
While 
in 
the 
future 
there 
may 
be 
more provinces 
interested 
in 
taking 
part, 
it 
may prove 
difficult to 
include 
more 
provinces 
at 
this 
stage 
given 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
the 
health 
care 
functions 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
project, 
implementing 
agencies 
and the 
level 
of 
authority/responsibility. 
One 
consequence 
will 
be 
the 
added 
complexity 
of 
having to 
deal 
with 
more 
than one 
counterpart. 
Another 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
the added 
difficulty/complexity 
in 
enrolling 
provinces 
and 
districts 
one 
by 
one 
through 
a 
longer consultative 
process, 
albeit coordinated 
by 
provincial 
authorities. 
Finally, 
the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank 
(ADB) 
is 
also 
set 
to 
prepare 
another 
project 
on 
decentralization 
of 
health 
services 
covering 
at least 
five 
other 
provinces. 
Broaden 
geographic 
coverage: 
As 
mentioned before 
this 
project 
will 
complement the 
two 
5. 
Provincial 
Health 
Project 
111: 
The 
PHP 
model 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
viable 
and 
is 
readily 
embraced 
by 
central, 
provincial 
and 
district 
authorities 
alike. 
In 
many 
ways, 
HWS 
is 
alun 
to 
and 
follows 
the 
lead 
of 
Provincial 
Health 
Projects 
I 
and 
II, 
its 
predecessors. 
In 
terms 
of 
scope 
and 
purpose, 
both 
projects 
intend 
to 
protect 
essential 
health 
services 
for 
the 
poor 
and 
to 
strengthen 
decentralized 
management 
through 
institutional 
build-up. 
At 
the 
district 
and 
provincial 
levels, they 
are 
substantively 
similar 
in 
their 
focus 
on 
decentralized 
financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
health 
services, 
albeit 
covering different 
provinces. 
PHP-II, 
like 
HWS, 
also 
has 
a 
strong central 
component, 
focusing 
on 
institutional 
development, 
albeit 
mostly 
on 
strengthening 
of 
communicable 
disease 
control, 
health 
research 
and 
capacities, 
and 
food 
and 
drug 
control. 
In 
addition to 
expanding 
PHP-like 
coverage 
to 
four 
more 
provinces and 
47 
districts and cities 
therein, 
HWS 
also 
goes 
further 
in 
building 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
at 
the 
Central 
level.  However, 
HWS 
goes 
beyond 
the 
MOH 
and 
provincial 
and 
district 
health offices 
to include 
MONE 
and 
IMA 
in 
its 
aim 
to 
strengthen 
human 
resources 
development 
on 
a 
longer time 
horizon 
through 
investment 
in 
formal 
higher 
education. 
Hence, 
in 
addition 
to 
supporting 
the 
Human 
Resources 
Empowerment 
Board 
of 
MOH, 
it 
expands 
to 
the 
Directorate 
General 
of 
Higher 
Education 
in 
MONE 
and the 
MA, 
the 
other 
two key 
stakeholders 
in 
health 
workforce policy, 
development, 
management 
and empowerment. 
This 
added 
layer 
is 
essential 
to 
design and 
carry 
out 
key 
human 
resources 
reforms and 
new 
regulations 
pertaining 
to 
vocational, pre-service and 
in-service training, 
higher 
education, 
licensing, 
certification 
and registration 
of 
providers, setting 
professional 
standards 
of 
medical 
practice, 
workforce 
deployment, 
retention, 
and 
financial 
and 
nonfinancial 
incentives, 
all 
key 
to 
building 
local 
capacity 
for 
successful 
decentralization 
with 
a 
longer 
horizon.

Two 
key 
lessons 
from 
previous 
experience 
are 
reflected 
in 
the proposed

design: 
(i) 
the 
need 
to 
have a broader system-wide

(e.g., 
PHP-I 
and 
PHP-11) 
instead 
of 
disease- 
or 
issue-specific 
(e.g., 
Nutrition, 
HIV/AIDS) 
approaches 
when designing health 
sector 
projects; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
need 
to 
emphasize 
local level 
and 
tailor 
project 
design 
accordingly 
for 
improved 
effectiveness 
(e.g., 
HP-IV 
and

(PHP-I) and 
North 
Sumatera,

and Banten 
(PHP-II), 
respectively. 
An 
additional goal 
is 
to 
help 
MOH 
restructure 
itself 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
roles 
in 
a decentralized 
setting. 
While 
it 
is 
too 
early 
to 
draw 
lessons 
from 
project 
implementation 
in 
a decentralized 
health 
care 
environment 
as 
such, 
these 
two 
projects 
have 
laid 
the 
ground 
work 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
in 
terms 
of 
project 
design 
and 
preparation, 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
functions covered (financing, 
delivery 
and 
capacity 
building), 
the 
level 
of 
intervention (district 
level 
for 
planning, 
management 
and service 
delivery; 
provincial level 
for 
public 
health 
functions),  the 
institutional 
mechanisms (joint 
and 
district 
health 
councils) 
and 
allocation 
of 
block 
funds. 
PHP-I 
pursues 
health improvement 
goals 
within 
the 
institutional 
setup 
defined 
by 
Laws 
22 
and 
25 
and accompanying 
measures 
and regulations. 
The PHP framework 
facilitates health 
sector 
decentralization, 
in 
part 
by 
fostering 
cross 
district 
cooperation 
in 
health 
development 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Joint 
Health 
Council 
(JHC) and a 
Technical 
Review Team 
(TRT) 
in 
each 
province. 
The 
project 
adopts 
a sector-wide 
approach. 
About 
70% 
of 
the 
funding 
is 
channeled 
to 
the 
districts 
through 
a 
block 
funding 
mechanism 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
district 
health improvement and 
reform 
proposals. 
The 
proposed 
project 
incorporates 
similar institutional 
design and 
funds 
channeling 
mechanism. 
PHP-I 
also finances 
reform 
efforts 
through 
the 
work 
of 
task forces 
established 
at 
the 
provincial 
level. 
The 
human 
resource 
development 
task 
force 
in 
Yogyakarta 
province, 
for 
example, has 
formulated 
alternative 
models 
for 
implementing 
regulatory 
functions, and 
drafting 
of 
standards 
of 
competence 
for 
doctors, 
midwives 
and 
nurses. 
It 
has 
also 
established 
criteria 
for 
recruitment 
of 
members 
of 
a 
council 
for 
improved 
quality. 
An 
assessment 
of 
Yogya’s 
health 
workforce 
indicated 
that the 
PHO 
was 
more 
than 
40% 
overstaffed.  Recommendations 
for 
downsizing 
were 
submitted 
to 
the 
Joint 
Health Council 
of 
the 
province 
for 
follow-up.  The 
proposed 
project 
will 
adopt 
similar 
approaches 
in 
the 
four 
provinces. 
The 
design 
of 
PHP-11 
follows 
that 
of 
PHP-I. 
But 
unlike 
its 
predecessor, 
PHP-11 
explicitly 
sets 
Rp 
42,000 
per 
capita (Year 
2001 
prices), 
as 
the 
desired spending 
level 
for 
health 
at the 
district 
level. 
This 
target 
is 
based 
on 
estimation 
of 
a 
minimum 
spending 
needed 
to 
attain 
a 
significant improvement 
in 
health. 
PHP-11 
also 
includes 
the 
training 
of 
staff 
from 
the schools 
of 
public 
health 
or 
equivalents 
in 
project 
provinces 
to 
improve 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
schools 
and 
their 
graduates 
in 
supporting health 
development 
efforts.  Other 
features 
of 
PHP-11 are 
strengthening 
of 
communicable 
disease 
control, 
including 
epidemiological surveillance 
and outbreak 
response, 
food 
and 
drug 
quality 
assurance 
and 
control,  upgrading 
of 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
health 
services. 
This 
project 
also 
uses 
the 
same 
spending 
targets 
(Year 2002 
prices) 
and 
similar training 
activities. 
The 
Fifth Health 
Project 
(Loan 
4374-IND; 
effectiveness 
date: 
September 
1998) 
The overall 
goal 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
increase the 
efficiency 
and 
productivity 
by 
improving 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
both private 
and 
public 
sectors, 
and 
the 
autonomy and 
accountability 
of 
health 
professionals 
through 
skill-building. 
It 
also 
introduced quality 
assurance 
and 
control 
mechanisms such 
as 
licensing 
and support 
to 
professional 
associations 
in 
Central 
Java, 
Central 
Kalimantan 
and South 
Sulawesi. 
HP-V 
anticipated 
GOI’s decentralization 
initiatives 
in 
its 
focus 
on 
improving 
the 
capacity 
of 
province 
and 
district

staff 
and 
introducing 
methods 
for

performance 
review, 
service 
quality 
assurance, 
and 
workload 
assessment 
linlung 
it 
with 
innovations 
in 
staff 
deployment. 
The project 
also 
empowers 
selected 
professional 
associations 
by 
strengthening organizations 
across 
levels, 
piloting 
new 
registration 
systems, 
designing 
continuing medical 
education 
systems, 
and 
drafting 
a 
law 
on 
health 
council. 
However, 
the 
initial 
design 
did 
not 
encompass 
local 
government 
involvement 
and 
district 
service 
reform 
as 
important 
elements 
for 
supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
Law 
22 
and 
25. 
The 
proposed 
-19- 
Page  24
project 
addressed 
similar health 
workforce 
issues 
with 
stronger emphasis 
on 
involvement 
of 
provincial 
and 
district 
governments. 
The 
Fourth Health 
Project (Loan 
3905-IND; 
closed 
on 
31 
March 
2001) 
The 
main 
goal 
of 
the 
Fourth 
Health 
project 
was 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
provincial 
and 
district 
health offices and health 
centers 
to 
plan 
and 
implement health 
programs and 
deliver cost-effective 
and 
high 
quality 
services. 
The project 
was 
assessed 
satisfactory 
at 
closure, 
and 
its 
sustainability 
was 
deemed 
highly likely. 
One 
key 
lesson 
learned 
relates 
to 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Special 
Assistance 
Fund, 
a 
kind 
of 
block 
grant, 
which 
in 
theory 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
linked 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
development 
plans, 
but 
which 
in 
practice 
was 
used 
liberally on 
the basis 
of 
ad 
hoc 
decisions. 
Another 
lesson concerns the 
use 
of 
performance-based 
incentives 
which 
needs 
to 
be 
based 
on 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
professional behavior 
rather 
than 
limiting 
it 
to 
the 
most 
basic 
criteria 
such 
as 
attendance 
and 
time 
spent 
in 
the workplace. 
On 
the 
positive 
side, 
HP-IV 
introduced 
a number 
of 
innovative 
experiments 
including 
private 
family 
practice, 
use 
of 
non-medical 
administrators, 
managed care 
(JPKM), 
clinical 
algorithms 
and 
rational 
use 
of 
drugs. 
The 
last 
two 
tools 
were 
particularly 
well 
received, 
and they 
are 
now 
part 
of 
in-service 
training 
curriculum 
nation-wide 
with 
plans 
to 
introduce 
them to 
formal 
medical 
education, 
worthy 
of 
consideration 
during 
review 
of 
medical curricula 
in 
this 
project. 
It 
is 
also 
worth 
noting 
that 
although 
there 
were considerable 
variations 
in 
terms 
of 
project implementation and impact 
across 
project 
sites, 
including 
East 
Kalimantan, 
one 
of 
the 
proposed provinces 
for 
this 
project, 
the latter's 
involvement 
in 
this 
project 
was 
very 
much 
conditioned 
by 
their 
favorable 
experience 
with 
HP-IV. 
Safe 
Motherhood 
Project (Loan 
4207-IND; 
effectiveness 
date: 
September 
1997) 
This 
project 
aims 
at 
improving 
maternal health 
status 
through 
improved 
demand 
for 
and 
utilization 
of 
quality 
maternal health 
services 
in 
Central 
and East 
Java. 
Two 
key 
features deserve 
attention: 
(i) 
integrated 
district 
plans 
because 
they 
are 
used 
to 
identify 
under-served 
population 
groups 
and 
training 
needs 
of 
midwives, 
doctors and 
managers; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
use 
district 
block 
grants 
by 
the 
Central 
government and 
how 
it 
affects 
project financing, 
including 
counterpart 
funds. 
The 
project 
has 
used 
different 
instruments 
to 
establish 
attractive 
and 
sustainable 
work 
conditions 
for 
village 
midwives, 
who 
are 
key 
providers 
of 
services 
potentially beneficial 
to 
poor 
women.  One 
of 
the measures 
piloted 
has 
been 
performance 
contracts, 
in 
which 
private midwives 
at the 
villages 
were contracted 
by 
the 
district 
government 
to 
provide 
midwifery 
services 
for 
the 
poor 
through 
a voucher 
system, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
they 
were 
given 
support 
to 
build 
up 
their private 
practices. 
This 
pilot 
scheme 
has 
proven 
to 
be effective 
in 
improving 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
services 
reaching 
poor 
clients. 
The project 
has 
also used 
different 
means 
to 
promote 
the 
acceptance 
of 
these 
front-line 
health providers 
in 
local 
communities. 
For 
example, 
use 
of 
coupons 
by 
poor 
households 
has 
been shown 
to 
be 
effective 
in 
inducing 
demand 
for 
healthcare and 
in 
empowering 
poor 
clients. 
These achievements 
are 
timely 
and 
relevant 
to 
challenges 
faced 
by 
budget-constrained 
districts 
that 
are 
responsible 
for 
providing 
services 
intended 
for 
the 
poor. 
Broadly 
speaking, 
the 
proposed 
project 
will 
take 
stock of, 
and 
build 
on 
the 
Fourth 
and 
Fifth 
Health 
projects, 
mostly 
concerning 
medical 
and 
in-service 
training 
and 
quality 
of 
care, 
and the 
Provincial 
Health 
Projects 
with 
regard 
to 
financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
health 
services 
in 
a decentralized 
context 
so 
as 
to 
buildstrengthen 
the 
organizational and 
institutional 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
service 
continuity 
and 
safeguard 
public 
health 
functions and activities. 
Finally, 
the 
Quality 
of 
Undergraduate 
Education 
(QUE) 
Project, 
an 
education 
sector 
project 
focusing 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
higher 
education 
in 
Indonesia, 
has 
also 
been 
reviewed 
for 
potential 
lessons 
regarding 
the 
medical 
education component. 
While 
QUE 
project 
design 
has 
been 
assessed 
as 
appropriate, 
including 
strategies such 
as 
competency-based 
curriculum, 
early 
clinical 
exposure, 
community-oriented 
medical 
education 
and 
quality 
assurance, 
lack 
of 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
appears 
to 
have 
hampered 
effective 
implementation. 
To 
prevent 
that 
from 
happening 
again, 
-20- 
Page  25
both 
Andalas and 
Mulawarman 
Universities 
have 
been 
directly 
involved 
in 
project 
preparation, 
and 
views 
and 
opinions 
of 
both 
faculty 
and 
students 
have 
been sought 
through 
focus 
group 
discussions, 
student 
surveys 
and 
SWOT 
analyses. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
its 
national 
development 
plan 
(PROPENAS). 
This 
project 
has 
generated 
high 
level 
of 
interest 
from 
central, 
provincial 
and 
district 
governments. 
"Healthy Indonesia 
2010", 
the 
official 
health 
policy 
statement 
of 
the 
GOI, 
has 
Human 
Resources 
Development 
as 
one 
of 
the 
four 
pillars 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal. 
Accordingly, 
MOH 
is 
very keen 
to 
overhaul 
its 
human 
resources 
policy 
and 
management, 
and 
has 
recently 
established 
the 
National 
Board 
for 
the 
Development 
and 
Empowerment 
of 
Health 
Human 
Resources. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education 
has 
for 
some 
time 
been 
advocating 
for 
Bank's 
involvement 
in 
reforming medical 
education. 
It 
has 
also 
recently 
disbanded 
the 
Consortium 
of 
Health 
Sciences 
(CMS), 
the semi-autonomous agency 
originally 
mandated 
to 
advise 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
MONE 
on 
curriculum 
development, 
by 
shifting 
this 
responsibility 
to 
IMA 
and 
MOH. 
The 
central project 
proposals that 
have been 
prepared 
by 
MOH 
and 
MONE 
take 
account 
of 
these 
recent 
developments. 
GO1 
has 
consistently 
emphasized 
Human 
Resources 
Development 
as 
a development 
objective 
in 
At 
the 
sub-national level, 
the 
selection 
of 
participating 
regions 
has 
thoroughly 
been a 
bottom-up 
process, 
including 
visits 
by 
the 
Bank 
project preparation team 
to 
governors, 
bupatis, 
DPRD 
health 
committees 
and 
Bappedas. 
Project 
preparation 
was 
only initiated 
in 
those 
regions where 
there 
was 
ownership, 
and 
a 
formal 
commitment 
expressed 
in 
the 
way 
of 
a 
letter 
of 
interest 
sent 
to 
Bank, 
each 
signed 
by 
governors 
and/or 
bupatis, 
and 
countersigned 
by 
DPRD 
chairmen, 
indicating their 
willingness 
to 
pay their 
share 
of 
loan 
repayment 
once the terms 
and 
conditions have 
been 
jointly 
agreed 
to 
by 
MOF. 
Their 
commitment 
has 
been tested 
and 
confirmed 
through 
the establishment 
of 
project 
preparation 
teams 
and 
drafting 
of 
regional 
proposals and PIPS 
in 
all 
regions, 
and 
by 
active 
participation 
in 
project-related 
workshops and 
training 
sessions. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
This 
project 
follows 
the 
lead 
set 
by 
previous health 
and 
higher 
education projects 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
design 
and 
key 
components such 
as 
district 
fund 
allocations, support 
to 
professional 
associations 
and 
competency-based 
medical 
curriculum 
development, 
to 
name 
a 
few.  Furthermore 
it 
expands 
its 
remit 
by 
combining 
health 
workforce 
and 
services 
in 
a 
new 
decentralized 
governance setting. 
It 
also extends 
its 
outreach 
by 
introducing 
Jambi, 
a 
new 
comer 
to 
Bank's 
health 
operations 
in 
Indonesia. 
The 
main 
value 
of 
Bank's support 
lies 
in 
its 
systemic 
and sector-wide 
approach 
to 
decentralization, 
covering 
all 
key 
functions 
of 
health 
care, 
namely 
human 
resources 
development, 
financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
basic 
health 
services. 
This 
support 
is 
very 
much 
in 
line 
with 
the 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Health 
Strategy 
note 
(Report 
No. 
21319-IND) 
which 
focuses 
on 
policy 
choices 
in 
an 
era 
of 
decentralization 
and economic constraints. 
In 
addition, 
Bank's 
support 
to 
the 
health 
sector 
in 
Indonesia 
remains consistent 
in 
its 
scope 
and 
coverage 
of 
policy 
issues, emphasis 
on 
strengthening 
local 
services, 
and 
cumulative 
and complementary 
in 
its 
coverage 
of 
key 
provinces 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
preceding 
two 
PHPs. 
As 
such, 
this 
string 
of 
projects 
is 
likely 
to 
foster a smooth 
transition 
to 
decentralized 
health 
services 
delivery 
and 
reduce 
the constraints 
in 
terms 
of 
financial 
and managerial 
capacity.

(see 
Annex

The 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
project 
covers the 
following: 
(a) 
country 
assistance strategy goals 
and 
Indonesian 
health 
sector strategy goals 
supported 
by 
the 
project; 
(b) 
rationale 
for 
public 
sector 
involvement 
and 
poverty impact 
of 
the 
project; 
(c) 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
of 
project 
interventions; 
(d) 
risk-sensitivity 
analysis; 
and 
(e) 
fiscal impact 
of 
project 
interventions. 
While 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to yield 
several 
benefits, 
many 
of 
which 
manifest 
itself 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
the 
benefit 
cost 
ratio 
for 
the 
project 
was 
calculated 
using 
a conservative estimate 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
improved 
health 
status 
of 
the 
population 
in 
project 
provinces 
through 
improved 
use 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
at 
the 
district 
level. 
These 
conservative 
estimates 
yield 
a 
benefit 
cost 
ratio 
of 
16.9. 
Several 
scenarios were 
considered 
which 
resulted 
in 
benefits 
which 
are 
75%, 
50%, 
25%, 
and 
10% 
of 
the base 
case. 
For 
all 
cases 
other 
than 
where 
very 
limited 
project 
benefits 
were 
assumed 
(10% 
of 
the 
base 
case), 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
project 
benefits 
was 
positive. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$  million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The financial 
assessment 
addressed the 
following 
issues: 
(i) 
the 
current 
financial 
flows for 
health 
from 
various 
sources 
to 
districts; 
(ii) 
mechanisms 
in 
place 
to 
oversee 
and 
manage 
local 
funds 
and 
transfers 
for 
health; 
(iii) 
provincial 
and 
district 
health 
accounts, 
namely documenting 
past 
spending and 
estimating 
prospective outlays; 
(iv) 
an 
appraisal 
of 
the 
affordability 
of 
counterpart 
funds 
by 
provincial 
and 
local 
governments 
during 
implementation; and 
(v) 
sustainability 
of 
funding 
for 
project 
activities 
beyond 
the 
closing 
date 
in 
participating 
provinces 
and 
districts. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
Currently, 
in 
the 
four 
provinces 
supported 
by 
the project, 
there 
is 
wide variation 
both within 
and 
across 
provinces 
in 
health 
spending 
per 
capita. 
In 
most 
districts 
however, 
health 
spending 
is 
low 
- 
in 
West 
Sumatera 
district 
health 
spending 
varies 
between 
5% 
and 
7% 
of 
district 
budgets, 
in 
Jambi 
it 
varies 
between 
3% 
and 
8%, 
in 
East 
Kalimantan 
between 
1% 
and 
4% 
and 
in 
West 
Kalimantan 
between 
5% 
and 
10%. 
In 
order 
to 
make substantial 
impact 
on 
key 
health indicators however 
substantial 
increase 
in 
health 
spending 
per capita 
would 
be required. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
funds 
to 
districts and provinces 
on 
a 
need 
basis 
to 
support development spending 
to 
achieve 
increased 
health 
outcomes. 
To 
avoid 
a 
large 
project 
size 
and 
a 
sharp 
drop 
in 
spending 
in 
2009, 
government 
health 
spending 
would 
have 
to 
increase 
during 
project 
implementation 
period 
in 
order 
sustain 
and 
deepen 
project 
benefits.  Increase 
in 
government 
health 
spending 
in 
the 
project 
districts 
is 
a 
key condition 
of 
the 
project. 
This 
will 
be 
monitored 
closely 
as 
a 
key 
performance 
indicator 
through 
the development 
of 
district 
health 
accounts 
on 
a 
biennial 
basis 
will 
the 
district 
health 
accounts 
for 
2002 
providing 
a baseline. 
The 
actual 
increase needed 
per 
district 
will 
be 
revisited 
during 
the 
mid 
term 
review 
based 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
- 
22 
- 
Page  27
district 
fund 
allocations 
and 
the 
experience 
of 
the previous 
two 
provincial 
health 
projects. 
3. 
Technical: 
There 
are three 
technical 
aspects 
that 
the 
project 
will 
mainly 
address: 
(i) 
human 
resources development 
policy 
and 
management, 
through 
building 
capacity 
of 
the 
key 
actors, 
namely 
the 
recently 
created 
Human 
Resources 
Development 
and 
Empowerment Board. 
This 
Board 
which 
has 
structured 
itself 
to 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
a decentralized 
health 
sector, 
and 
increased 
regionalization/globalization 
and 
information 
technologies 
and 
their 
use 
in 
education, 
training 
and 
medical 
practice. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
help 
planning 
for 
human 
resources, 
especially 
medical 
doctors. 
Other 
professions, 
especially 
nursing, 
will 
also 
be incorporated 
in 
the 
plan 
for 
a 
more 
thorough 
view 
of 
health 
care 
in 
its 
entirety. 
(ii) 
institutional 
foundation 
of 
the medical 
and 
other 
health 
professions, 
will 
be 
reformed 
on 
the basis 
of 
detailed 
analyses 
of 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
all 
the 
institutions 
and 
stakeholders 
involved. 
As 
such, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
medical council 
for 
regulating 
the 
profession, a 
revision 
of 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
existing 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
erstwhile 
CMS 
and 
IMA 
is 
planned 
to 
better 
respond 
to 
changing 
needs 
and 
preferences 
of 
the 
medical 
community, 
mainly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
licensing, 
registration, 
certification 
and accreditation, especially 
with 
regard 
to 
private 
practice.  Comparable 
initiatives 
will 
be 
undertaken 
with 
the 
nursing 
and 
midwifery 
professions, 
according 
to 
their 
readiness, 
under 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
MOH 
and 
introducing 
self-regulation 
in 
a 
parallel way to 
empower 
all 
health 
professionals. 
(iii) 
decentralized 
health 
sector 
management 
envisages 
a 
move 
away 
from 
top-down 
and technocratic 
system 
stewardship, 
regulation 
and management towards 
a 
more 
pluralistic 
management 
through 
setting 
up 
new 
institutions 
such 
as 
JHCs 
and 
DHCs 
which 
will 
include 
representatives 
of 
not only 
government 
agencies, 
but 
also 
professional 
associations 
and 
consumers.  One 
key 
aspect 
of 
the 
new 
setup 
is 
the

are 
to 
operate 
under 
the

and 
standards 
in 
competing 
for

in 
a

A 
prerequisite 
for 
the

is 
the

Institutional: 
Indonesia 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
decentralizing 
its 
administrative 
structure. 
According 
to 
Law 
22, 
responsibility 
for 
health 
has 
now 
been 
devolved 
to 
district 
level. 
However, 
the 
roles and responsibilities 
of 
each 
level 
of 
government 
with 
regard 
to 
various 
functions 
of 
health 
care, 
especially 
for 
human 
resources, 
public 
health and health financing, 
are 
still 
unclear and need 
to 
be 
worked 
out.  Further, 
this 
project involves 
multiple 
partners and 
beneficiaries 
from 
both 
the 
public 
and 
non-governmental 
sectors, 
including 
professional 
associations, and 
project 
activities 
are 
spread 
over 
three 
layers 
of 
governance. 
Therefore, there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
a 
thorough 
ongoing institutional 
assessment 
during 
the 
project 
to 
maintain 
clarity 
in 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
each 
of 
these 
organizations 
in 
the 
implementation 
and 
to 
assist

Key 
executing 
agencies 
include 
local 
governments 
in 
Jambi, 
West 
Sumatera, 
East 
Kalimantan 
and West 
Kalimantan, 
and 
MOH 
and 
MOM 
at 
the 
central level. 
Most 
of 
the 
project 
activities 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
district 
governments. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Management 
arrangements 
are 
designed 
to 
take 
into 
account 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
Bank 
financed 
projects, 
particularly 
the PHPs. 
The 
project 
will 
have 
one 
management 
unit 
at 
each 
level 
with 
assigned 
implementation 
and 
management 
roles 
that 
are 
consistent 
with 
the mandates and 
roles 
of 
the 
different implementing 
agencies. 
The 
project 
will 
be implemented 
mainly 
at 
the 
district 
level. 
The 
roles 
of 
DNs, 
PCNs, 
CPCUs and advisory and 
control/oversight 
bodies 
at 
each 
level 
(DHC, 
JHC, 
TRT, 
TRC 
and 
IACC) 
have 
been 
defined. 
The composition 
and 
staffing 
of 
these 
units 
will 
be 
subject 
to Bank 
approval. 
The 
necessary 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
ensure 
that 
these 
units 
are 
able 
to perform 
the agreed 
functions effectively. 
The 
roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
skills 
of 
the 
Project 
Directors, 
Project 
Managers, 
Executive 
Secretaries 
at 
each 
level 
are 
also 
well 
defined. 
The 
candidates 
selected 
for 
these 
positions 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
World 
Bank 
approval, 
and 
no 
modifications 
will 
be 
made 
to 
their roles 
without Bank 
approval.

A 
CPAR 
was 
recently 
conducted, 
and the

on 
March 
27, 
2001. 
The 
key 
procurement 
issues 
identified 
in 
the 
CPAR 
relevant 
the 
this 
project include 
differences 
in 
the 
required 
Bank 
procurement 
procedures 
and 
the 
applicable 
local 
procedures. 
The 
provisions 
suggested 
in 
the 
CPAR to 
address 
this 
issue 
will 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
legal 
agreements. 
A 
procurement

assessment has 
been 
conducted 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
project 
in

with 
the 
instructions 
issued 
by 
OCSPR. 
A 
procurement

has 
also 
been developed 
and

fiduciary 
environment 
in 
Indonesia 
remains weak 
despite 
a 
political 
commitment 
to 
improve fiduciary 
practices. 
Responsibilities 
are 
unclear, 
with 
legislative and 
regulatory 
instruments 
often 
vague 
and inconsistent, 
all 
the 
more 
so 
after 
the onset 
of 
decentralization. 
According 
to 
Transparency 
International, Indonesia 
ranks 
amongst the 
most corrupt 
on 
the 
"Corruption 
Perception Index".

Office; 
and 
(ii) 
Directorate 
General 
of 
Higher 
Education 
(DGHE), 
MONE, 
including 
a 
visit 
to 
the 
Medical 
Faculty, 
Andalas 
University.  The 
assessment 
concluded 
that 
pending 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
issues 
mentioned 
in 
the 
Proposed 
Action 
Plan 
the 
project 
will 
satisfy 
the 
Bank’s financial 
management 
requirements 
as 
stipulated 
in 
OP/BP 
10.02. 
However, considering 
that the 
Implementing 
Unit 
has 
experience 
with 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Report 
(FMR) 
based disbursement, 
it 
is 
recommended that 
FMR 
be 
used 
by 
the 
project 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
the disbursement since 
it 
provides 
better 
monitoring 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Below 
are 
the 
financial 
management 
risks, 
and 
how 
they 
will 
be 
addressed 
per 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
PHP-I: 
(i) 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
(PMM) 
and 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
Manual 
(DFAM) 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
project 
implementation, especially 
in 
anticipating 
potential 
problems. 
The 
PMM 
will 
include 
organizational 
structure, 
job 
description, budgeting, procurement, and guidelines 
for 
record 
keeping. 
The 
FMR 
will 
constitute 
the basis 
for 
disbursement 
and 
will 
cover preparation and 
recording 
of 
financial 
statements, 
fixed 
assets 
management, 
internal 
control, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation mechanism 
for 
the 
project 
management system, 
auditing 
arrangements 
and 
governance 
and disclosure

for 
the 
project. 
DFAM 
describes 
funding 
allocation, proposal 
preparation 
process, 
organization 
structure and 
job 
descriptions, 
flow 
of 
funds 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation, 
including 
the 
mechanism 
for 
interim 
audit. 
(ii) 
Since 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
are 
meant 
to 
be followed 
by 
all 
project coordination 
and 
implementation 
staff, 
training 
on 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
will 
also 
be 
carried out 
for 
proper 
project 
implementation. 
The 
training 
is 
expected 
to 
cover 
both 
procurement and 
financial 
management, 
including 
the 
preparation 
of 
FMR 
for 
the 
relevant 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff. 
(iii) 
The 
selection 
and 
proper 
compensation 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretary(ies), 
ProjecdSub-Project 
Manager(s) 
and 
treasurer(s) 
are 
also 
critical 
for 
the 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
PMM 
and 
DFAM. 
(iv) 
Supervision 
of 
project 
implementation 
at 
the 
DIU 
level 
is 
equally 
important 
in 
instituting 
proper 
financial

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
(Please 
see 
Annex 
11 
for 
more 
details.) 
Potential environmental 
and 
human health 
impacts 
examined 
in 
completing 
the 
environmental 
review 
(ER) 
corresponded 
to 
planned: 
(a) 
construction 
of 
new 
small 
hospitals and 
health 
centers, 
and renovation 
of 
existing 
health 
care 
facilities 
(HCF); 
(b) 
health 
care 
waste management 
(HCWM) 
practices at 
HCF; 
and 
(c) 
possible 
use 
of 
insecticides 
in 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs. 
Findings 
are 
summarized 
by 
activity 
as 
follows:

Health 
Care 
Facility 
Civil 
Works 
- 
Review 
of 
planned 
HCF 
construction 
and 
renovation 
confirmed 
that 
these 
activities 
do 
not 
pose any serious 
environmental 
concerns. 
New 
constructions 
are 
limited to 
two 
Class 
C hospitals 
with 
50 
beds 
and 
15 
healthhub-health 
centers.  These 
would 
trigger 
additional 
full 
assessment 
under Indonesia’s 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
(EM), 
or 
AMDAL, 
requirements. 
Recognizing 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
civil 
works 
will 
involve only minor 
renovations 
to 
existing facilities 
at 
the 
district 
and 
village 
level 
and construction 
of 
modest-sized 
new 
structures 
(Le., 
a 
typical 
village 
health 
care 
post 
has 
a 
total 
floor 
space 
of 
approximately 
36 
m’), 
anticipated 
construction-related 
environmental impacts 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
minimal 
and 
are 
readily 
addressed 
through 
the 
application of available 
mitigation 
measures. 
Potential environmental 
and 
occupational health 
concerns 
relating 
to 
planned 
civil 
works 
at 
the 
district 
level 
(e.g., 
construction and

of 
sub-health 
and

were also 
examined 
in 
completing 
the 
ER, 
and corresponding 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
incorporated 
into 
the 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP). 
(b) 
Health 
Care 
Facility 
Operations 
- 
Potential 
human 
health 
and 
environmental 
threats associated 
with 
medical 
waste generated 
by 
HCF, 
particularly 
infectious 
waste, 
were subject 
to 
thorough 
review 
in 
completing 
the 
ER. 
It 
was 
determined that 
risks 
associated 
with 
medical 
wastes are 
well 
defined and 
can 
be 
readily 
addressed 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
best 
HCWM 
practices 
encompassing: 
(i) 
waste 
minimization, 
recycling, 
and 
reuse; 
(ii) 
proper 
handling, 
storage, 
and transportation; 
and 
(iii) 
treatment 
of 
waste 
by 
safe 
and environmentally 
sound 
methods 
as 
detailed 
in 
the 
EMP. 
The 
need 
to 
address 
liquid 
waste 
in 
planning 
HCF 
construction and 
renovations 
was 
also 
examined 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ER. 
Recommendations 
concerning 
appropriate 
waste water treatment 
practices 
necessary 
to 
minimize 
human 
health 
risks 
associated 
with 
discharge 
of 
untreated 
or 
inadequately treated 
sewage 
are 
incorporated 
into 
the 
EMP. 
(c) 
all 
chemicals expected 
to 
be 
used 
as 
part 
of 
the 
HWS 
project 
have successfully 
passed 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization’s  Pesticide 
Evaluation 
Scheme 
(WHOPES). 
Insecticides 
favored 
for 
residual 
space 
spraying and 
larviciding 
in 
Indonesia have been 
selected 
primarily on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
relatively 
low 
toxicity 
and comparative 
effectiveness 
and 
are 
considered 
to 
pose 
a 
very 
low 
risk 
to 
humans 
if 
used 
correctly. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
environmental 
toxicity 
of 
insecticides 
used 
in 
vector 
control 
programs 
represents 
a 
potential 
concern that 
must 
be considered 
in 
project planning 
and implementation. 
Detailed 
review 
of 
occupational health 
and 
environmental 
safeguards 
in 
place 
for 
vector 
control 
programs 
in 
Indonesia 
provided 
assurances 
that 
existing 
stringent 
policies 
and 
procedures 
will 
be 
effective 
in 
ensuring that 
risks 
associated 
with 
possible 
improper handling 
or 
disposal 
of 
chemical 
insecticides 
are 
negligible. 
Recommended 
enhancements 
to 
existing 
guidelines 
covering 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
Pesticide Management and 
Monitoring 
Plan (PMMP). 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
(Please 
see 
Annex 
11 
for 
more 
details). 
Recommended 
mitigation 
measures 
intended 
for 
application 
during 
project planning 
and 
implementation 
are 
detailed 
in 
an 
EMP 
and 
PMMP. 
Recommendations 
contained therein 
were 
developed 
in 
close 
consultation 
with 
the 
implementing 
agencies, 
and 
will 
be implemented 
and 
monitored 
together 
with 
the 
other 
project 
activities 
and 
evaluated 
both 
at 
mid-term 
and at 
final 
evaluation. 
GO1 
adoption 
of 
the 
EMP 
is 
covenanted 
in 
the 
legal 
agreement. 
Main 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
the 
EMP 
and 
PMMP 
are 
summarized 
below: 
Pesticide 
Use

Best environmental 
and 
occupational health 
practices 
must 
be 
followed 
during 
civil 
works 
to 
minimize or 
avoid 
any 
potential 
adverse 
impacts. 
A 
comprehensive 
environmental managemendmonitoring 
plan 
(Le., 
referred 
to 
as 
a 
UKLAJPL) 
shall 
be 
prepared 
for 
all 
new 
HCF 
construction 
andor 
renovation 
of 
existing facilities 
to 
ensure 
that any 
potential 
construction 
and 
operational 
phase 
environmental 
issues 
are 
identified 
and that appropriate 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
adopted 
to 
minimize or avoid 
adverse 
impacts 
(see 
Annex 
11). 
Health 
Care 
Facility 
Operations 
- 
Environmental 
issues 
posed 
by 
health 
care 
waste 
(HCW) 
generated 
during 
hospital 
and 
health 
center 
operations 
are 
readily 
resolved through adoption 
of 
appropriate 
HCWM 
systems encompassing 
all 
aspects 
of 
waste generation, 
collection 
and 
segregation, 
transportation, 
storage, 
and 
safe disposal. 
In 
implementing 
the 
HWS 
project, 
it 
is 
crucial 
that every

participating 
HCF 
(i.e., 
comprising 
C 
and 
D 
hospitals, 
district 
health and 
sub-health 
centers, 
and 
village 
health 
posts) adopt adequate waste 
handling 
and 
disposal 
infrastructure 
and 
management 
systems 
that 
meet accepted standards 
for 
HCF 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Reflecting 
the 
broad 
range 
of civil 
works 
proposed 
under 
the 
HWS 
project, 
it 
is 
recognized that 
responses 
to 
potential HCW-related 
concerns 
should be 
commensurate 
to 
the 
type 
of 
facility 
concerned 
(e.g., 
minimal 
HCWM 
practices 
are 
appropriate 
for 
traditional village 
health 
posts 
whereas 
more 
sophisticated and comprehensive practices 
are 
essential 
for 
Class 
C and 
D 
hospitals). 
Particular attention 
shall 
be 
given 
to 
selecting 
HCWM 
systems 
that 
both 
fully 
comply 
with 
existing 
Indonesian regulations and guidelines and 
which 
reflect new 
developments 
in 
HCWM 
(e.g., 
although 
incineration 
is 
currently 
the 
required method 
for 
solid 
medical 
waste treatment 
in 
Indonesia, 
autoclaving offers many 
advantages 
and 
is 
recommended 
as 
an 
alternative 
method 
for 
treating infectious 
solid 
wastes 
in 
small 
hospitals and 
health 
centers 
which lack 
access 
to 
approved 
incineration 
facilities). 
Existing 
comprehensive 
guidelines 
for 
HCF 
operations 
promulgated 
by 
the 
MOH 
reflect 
current best practice and 
should 
be 
strictly 
adhered to. 
Health 
care 
facilities shall 
also 
demonstrate 
ongoing compliance 
with 
all 
regulatory 
monitoring 
requirements 
(i.e., 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
of 
liquid 
wastewater discharges, 
air 
emissions 
from 
incinerators)  and 
maintain 
proper 
documentation 
for 
audit and 
review 
purposes. 
To 
assist 
HCF 
in 
operationalizing 
best 
HCWM 
practices, 
it 
is 
recommended that 
additional 
resources 
be 
devoted 
to 
human 
resource 
development and 
institutional 
strengthening 
(e.g., 
awareness 
building 
training 
for 
all 
health 
and 
auxiliary 
staff, 
preparation 
of 
standard 
operating 
procedures, 
adoption 
of 
environmental 
management 
systems 
to 
demonstrate 
good 
environmental 
performance, capacity 
building 
in 
compliance monitoring). 
It 
is 
further 
recommended that 
additional 
authoritative 
reference materials 
(e.g., 
guidance 
documents 
and 
training 
materials available 
from 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization 
represent 
an 
excellent 
resource) 
covering 
discrete 
HCWM 
topics 
be 
made 
available 
to 
health 
care 
practitioners 
and administrators. 
Pesticide 
Management 
and 
Monitoring Plan 
Review 
of 
ongoing 
malaria 
and 
vector 
control 
programs 
in 
Indonesia 
indicated 
that 
existing 
occupational 
and 
environmental health 
safeguards 
are 
comprehensive and 
that best management 
practices 
are 
being followed 
in 
program 
implementation. 
For 
this 
reason, 
recommended 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
primarily 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that 
safeguards 
already 
in 
place 
are 
strictly 
adhered 
to 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
future 
vector 
control 
programs 
funded 
under 
the 
HWS 
project. 
Gap 
analysis 
was 
completed 
on 
existing 
guidelines 
pertaining to 
current pesticide 
use 
in 
the 
four 
participating 
provinces and 
specific 
aspects 
of 
program planning 
and 
implementation 
with 
a 
view 
to 
identifying 
technical 
and 
administrative 
aspects 
that 
would 
benefit 
from 
selective 
enhancements. 
To 
this 
end, 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
the 
PMMP 
focus 
on 
reinforcing 
occupational 
safety 
and 
environmental 
protection 
through 
the 
incorporation 
of 
additional 
safeguards encompassing: 
(i) 
pesticide 
procurement, 
storage 
and 
distribution; 
(ii) 
occupational 
safety 
and environmental 
protection training to 
health 
care 
workers 
involved 
in 
space 
spraying 
and 
larviciding; 
(iii) 
dissemination 
of 
environmental 
awareness 
educations 
materials 
to local 
communities; 
and 
(iv) oversight 
of 
safeguards 
application 
during 
field 
operations.

with 
the 
planned project activities 
and 
to solicit 
inputs 
with 
a 
view 
to 
crafting 
appropriate 
mitigation 
and 
remediation 
measures. 
Interviews 
were 
completed 
with 
key 
government 
agencies 
including 
the 
MOH, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
(MOE),  and 
provincial/district 
health and 
environmental 
officials to 
identify 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
planned 
new 
HCF 
construction, 
renovation 
of 
existing facilities, and pesticide 
use 
in 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs. 
Field 
visits 
to 
representative 
HCF 
at 
the 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
review 
current 
operational 
practices and 
assess 
potential 
site-specific 
environmental 
issues. 
Follow-up 
consultations 
with 
central 
government 
environment 
and 
health 
agencies 
and 
participating 
provinces/districts 
were 
held 
to 
review, 
discuss, 
and reach 
agreement 
on 
the 
project’s environmental 
issues 
and 
recommendations 
intended 
to 
prevent, 
minimize or 
mitigate 
any adverse 
impacts and 
to 
improve 
environmental 
performance. 
Additional 
consultations 
were 
completed 
with 
health 
care specialists 
from 
international 
organizations and 
representatives 
from 
nongovernmental organizations 
to 
solicit 
inputs 
on 
specific 
issues 
such 
as 
HCWM 
practices, 
and 
pesticide 
use 
in 
vector 
control 
programs. 
A 
complete 
list 
of 
contacts 
is 
provided 
as 
an 
Annex to 
the 
ER 
report. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have been 
established 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment’? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Mtigation 
measures 
prescribed 
in 
the 
EMP 
and 
PMMP 
are 
expected 
to 
fully 
address 
all 
human 
health 
and 
environmental 
impacts 
associated 
with 
implementation 
of 
project 
activities. 
Although 
no 
significant 
environmental 
impacts have been 
identified 
for 
planned 
HCF 
construction and rehabilitation, 
provisions 
have been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
EMP 
to 
document 
potential 
environmental 
risks 
and 
to 
apply 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures 
during 
project 
implementation. 
Follow-up 
assistance 
to 
the 
GO1 
will 
include review 
of 
their intended implementation 
strategy 
and 
approach 
to 
ensure 
that 
environmental 
safeguards 
are 
properly 
applied 
throughout. 
Ongoing 
technical 
feedback 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
HWS 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable environmental 
safeguards 
relating 
to 
planned 
HCF 
civil 
works. 
Gap analysis 
of 
existing 
guidelines 
and 
training 
materials 
for 
the 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs 
revealed 
no 
concerns 
pertaining to project 
implementation. 
Adoption 
of 
minor 
recommended 
revisions contained 
in 
the 
PMMP will 
provide additional 
assurances 
that 
human 
health 
and 
environmental 
concerns 
relating to 
these 
programs 
are 
fully 
addressed. 
Satisfactory implementation 
of 
all 
recommended 
safeguards 
will 
be 
evaluated 
both 
at 
HWS 
project 
mid-term review 
and 
final 
evaluation.

Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify 
the project’s 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
A 
Stakeholder 
Analysis 
identified 
the roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
various consumer 
protection 
and 
community-based organizations, and 
existing 
health professional 
associations 
in 
health facilities 
management, 
curriculum 
development, self-regulation,  peer-review, 
licensing, accreditation 
and 
sanctioning. 
A 
Study 
on Health 
Care Seelung 
Behavior 
was 
undertaken 
to 
identify 
community 
health-care 
seeking 
behavior, 
including 
the 
minoritiedethnic 
group 
in 
the 
project province 
areas, 
and 
identify 
basic 
health 
status 
indicators, 
which 
would 
be 
used 
to effectively 
design 
and 
target 
project 
activities 
and 
provide 
a 
basis 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate

All 
documents 
related 
to 
the 
project’s 
social 
analysis are 
located 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
See 
Annex 
12 
for 
the 
Isolated Vulnerable 
Peoples 
Development 
Strategy. 
Key 
social 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
project 
objectives 
are 
decentralization, 
inequalities 
in 
access 
to health 
services, 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
Decentralization 
The 
decentralization 
of 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
public 
health 
care 
from 
the 
central 
government 
to 
the 
districts 
has 
lead 
to profound 
changes 
in 
the 
way 
that 
these 
services 
are 
financed, 
planned 
and delivered. 
While 
decentralization 
presents an 
opportunity 
for 
government 
to 
become 
more 
accountable 
and responsible 
to 
local 
needs, 
many 
provincial 
and 
district level 
agencies 
lack 
the technical, 
managerial, and 
financial 
capacity 
to 
plan 
and 
manage 
health 
services. 
Without 
additional 
assistance 
in 
improving local 
capacity 
there 
is 
the 
potential 
for 
degradation 
in 
health 
services 
and 
consequent 
reduced health 
status 
of 
the 
population. 
Decentralization, 
if 
implemented properly, 
can 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
services 
by 
bringing 
decision 
making 
closer 
to 
local 
communities, and 
by 
reducing 
the “leakage” 
of 
government 
funds 
through corruption. 
It 
is 
expected that there 
will 
be 
a 
greater 
role 
for 
consumers 
in 
health 
policy 
making, 
planning, and system 
management 
through 
the 
participation 
of 
consumer 
organizations and other 
stakeholders 
in 
District 
Health 
Councils, 
Joint 
Health 
Councils, and 
Technical Review 
Teams, 
the 
latter 
two 
being 
provincial level 
organizations. 
Access 
to Health 
Services 
Despite many 
years 
of 
investment 
in 
primary 
health 
care, 
large 
variations 
in 
access 
to 
health 
services 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
still 
exist, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
Isolated 
and 
Vulnerable 
Peoples 
(IVP). 
Lack 
of 
access 
to 
health 
services, 
inequitable 
distribution 
of 
health 
care subsidies, 
and 
under-utilization 
of 
public 
health 
care services 
all 
increase 
the 
burden 
of 
disease 
on 
the 
poor. 
Government 
resources 
are 
not 
adequately targeted 
to 
the 
disadvantaged 
and 
poor. 
During 
the 
field 
visits 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
social review, 
NGO 
respondents 
and 
members 
of 
the 
IVP 
communities reported 
that 
the 
principle 
barriers 
to 
accessing 
health 
services 
include 
the 
cost 
of 
the service and geographic 
isolation. 
This 
is 
compounded 
by 
the 
perception 
among 
many 
of 
poor 
service 
received 
at the 
local 
health 
care centers. 
A 
common 
issue 
voiced 
by 
most 
of 
the 
NGOs 
and 
community 
members 
consulted 
during 
this 
research 
was 
the cost associated 
with 
accessing 
government 
health 
services.  Services 
that 
are 
supposedly 
offered 
for 
free 
to 
the 
poor 
are 
often 
subject 
to “informal” 
fees 
and 
charges, 
both 
for 
service and 
for 
medicine.  Remote 
communities 
have 
difficulties 
in 
recruiting 
and 
retaining 
health 
care 
workers 
such 
as 
midwives 
(bidan), 
often 
the 
only 
source 
of 
modem 
health 
care 
in 
isolated 
villages. 
Many 
government-trained 
midwives 
are 
reluctant 
to 
remain 
in 
isolated 
areas 
without 
family 
or 
other 
social 
connections, 
and 
receive 
inadequate compensation 
for 
remote posting. 
Quality 
of 
Health 
Services 
Many 
of 
the 
stakeholders 
consulted 
during 
the 
social 
review 
reported 
a 
lack 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
care 
provided 
by 
the 
public 
health 
care system. 
Many 
indicated 
a preference 
for 
traditional 
methods 
(e.g., 
herbal 
remedies, 
spiritual 
ceremonies) 
over 
those 
offered 
by 
modem 
health 
care services, 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
illness. 
Typically 
the concerns 
about 
quality 
of 
service focused 
on 
health 
centers.  Issues 
include 
a 
lack 
of 
staff, 
absence 
of 
supplies 
and 
medicine, and 
ineffective 
treatment. 
Evidence 
suggests 
that 
often 
health 
center 
staff 
are 
engaged 
in 
some 
form 
of 
private 
practice and 
place a 
low 
priority 
on providing 
health 
care 
to 
the 
poor. 
As 
a result, 
users 
often 
resort 
to 
the 
use 
of 
traditional 
medicine 
or 
private 
practitioners, 
if 
funding 
is 
available. 
Contributing 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
trust 
in 
government 
- 
29 
- 
Page  34
health 
services 
is 
the treatment 
of 
traditional 
methods 
by 
government 
officials. 
Often 
government 
health 
care 
workers 
frown 
upon 
the 
use 
of 
traditional 
methods 
and 
its 
effectiveness 
is 
dismissed. 
It 
was 
also 
observed that government 
midwives, 
usually young 
women, 
do 
not 
have the 
confidence 
of 
pregnant 
women 
in 
traditional 
villages, 
who 
are 
more 
likely to 
place 
their 
trust 
in 
older, 
traditional midwives 
or 
healers. 
The 
principle 
social 
development 
outcomes that 
will 
be 
achieved 
by 
the 
project 
include 
the 
improvement 
of 
health 
outcomes 
of 
the 
poor, 
including 
communities 
of 
IVP, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
bottom 
up 
health 
planning 
mechanisms. 
This 
will 
alleviate 
existing 
social 
tensions 
resulting 
from 
inequities 
in 
the 
health 
status 
and 
access 
to 
health 
services 
across 
economic 
groups. 
Health 
services 
will 
be 
specifically tailored to 
the 
needs 
and 
goals 
of 
local 
communities 
and 
these 
communities 
will 
become 
empowered 
to 
participate 
effectively 
in 
health 
services 
planning. 
Through 
representation 
of 
stakeholders 
including 
IVP 
and women's organizations 
on 
the 
DHC, 
JHC 
and 
TRC, 
it 
is 
expected that 
the 
interests 
of 
IVP 
and 
women 
will 
be integrated 
into 
overall 
health 
services 
planning 
and 
delivery. 
The 
social 
risks 
associated 
with 
this 
project 
stem 
from 
the 
potential 
for 
inadequate 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
leading 
to 
a 
further 
reduction 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
health 
care 
system 
among the 
poor. 
If 
issues 
related 
to 
IVP 
communities 
and 
outcomes 
for 
women 
are 
not 
specifically 
addressed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
project 
activities, 
the 
project 
could 
potentially 
increase 
existing 
inequalities 
of 
access 
and 
outcome. 
6.2 
Participatory Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project'? 
(ii) 
medical 
faculties 
and 
medical 
students; 
(iii) 
Indonesia 
Medical 
Association:  and 
(iv) 
residents 
in 
project 
districts. 
Provincial 
Project Implementation 
Plans 
(PIPS) 
have 
been 
drafted 
by 
district 
and 
provincial 
authorities 
in 
consultation 
with 
health 
personnel 
and 
local 
communities 
in 
their 
respective 
areas. 
Isolated 
vulnerable 
peoples 
have been 
included 
in 
project planning 
and 
in 
consultations 
related 
to 
PIPS. 
Faculty 
in 
medical 
schools, 
IMA 
and 
students 
will 
be involved 
in 
the 
review 
and upgrading 
of 
curricula 
and 
pedagogy 
through 
workshops and focus 
group 
meetings. 
Table 
6.2.1 
summarizes 
the 
stakeholder 
groups 
identified 
through 
the 
course 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
work 
and 
their participation 
in 
the 
project. 
In 
general, 
key 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
project 
include: 
(i) 
district 
and 
provincial 
health 
personnel; 
A 
stakeholder analysis 
was 
conducted 
to 
support 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
analysis 
included 
the 
identification 
of 
relevant 
stakeholders 
as 
well 
as 
their 
respective 
roles and 
responsibilities. 
Discussions 
were 
held 
with 
central, 
provincial, 
district, and 
village-level 
health 
and 
planning 
officials 
in 
Jakarta, 
West 
Kalimantan, 
East 
Kalimantan, 
Jambi, 
and West 
Sumatera. 
In 
addition 
to 
government 
officials, 
meetings were 
conducted 
with 
professional 
organizations 
including 
central 
and 
provincial 
midwife 
associations, 
nursing 
associations, associations 
of 
environmental health 
experts, 
educational and 
training 
associations 
and 
institutes, 
and 
academic 
institutions. 
This 
information 
was 
supplemented 
by 
consultations 
with 
community 
organizations 
involved 
in 
nutrition 
and 
health, 
reproductive health 
and 
consumer associations. 
The 
consultation 
with 
stakeholders 
included individual 
interviews 
and workshops. 
A 
baseline survey 
of 
health 
seeking 
behavior 
was 
also 
conducted 
to 
determine 
patterns 
of 
health 
seeking behavior, 
willingness 
to 
pay, 
accessibility 
of 
health 
insurance, 
and 
perceptions 
of 
health 
services 
among 
people 
in 
the 
target provinces. 
Surveys were 
conducted 
of 
families randomly 
selected 
among 
at 
least 
three 
districts 
in 
each

Sustainability

1. 
Sustainability: 
build-up 
and 
strengthening. 
At 
present, the 
health 
sector 
in 
Indonesia 
is 
under-funded, 
and 
has 
been 
so 
for 
most 
of 
the 
1990s, 
despite 
some 
year-to-year 
variations.  Average 
per capita 
outlays 
from 
public 
sources 
remain very 
low, 
with 
wide 
variations 
across 
provinces, 
and 
a 
bias 
in 
favor 
of 
inpatient 
care, 
increasingly 
so 
since 
mid 
1990s. 
In 
project 
provinces, 
local public 
health 
expenditures 
also 
vary widely, 
between 
a 
very 
low 
of 
Rp 
18,400 
and a 
high 
of 
Rp 
230,000 
per 
capita 
in 
2002, 
or 
in 
percentage terms, 
between 
a 
low 
of 
2% 
and 
a 
high 
of 
11% 
of 
local 
revenues, 
mostly 
averaging 
5-6%, 
unacceptably 
low 
compared 
with 
the 
recommended 
15% 
by 
MOH. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
this 
project

and

All 
four 
provinces and 
the 
47 
districts therein 
have 
been 
directly 
involved 
in 
project 
preparation, 
and 
have 
expressed 
their willingness 
to 
participate 
by 
providing 
letters 
of 
commitment 
from 
bupatis 
endorsed 
by 
the 
DPRD 
leadership. 
They 
have agreed 
to 
increase 
health 
spending 
relative 
to 
overall 
district 
public 
spending. 
Therefore, 
this 
project, 
like 
its 
predecessors 
(PHP-I 
and 
PHP-11), 
will 
sustain 
their 
health 
funding 
at adequate 
levels, 
and 
help them 
allocate 
their 
resources 
on 
the basis 
of 
local 
health 
priorities 
and 
needs. 
Provinces and 
districts 
will 
estimate 
their 
total 
funding 
from 
local 
revenues and 
central 
grants against 
their 
project 
targets 
for 
revenue 
mobilization. 
Project 
funds 
will 
be 
used 
to 
complement 
existing 
resources, 
albeit 
for 
use 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
regional priorities 
and 
annual 
plans 
as 
approved 
by 
DHCs. 
World 
Bank 
funding 
will 
gradually 
decrease 
over 
project 
span 
with 
concurrent 
increase 
in 
district 
allocations 
with 
the 
outlay reaching 
15% 
of 
total district 
budget

Annex 
2: 
Detailed Project Description 
INDONESIA: 
Health 
Workforce and 
Services 
Background 
Since 
January 
2001, 
when 
legislation decentralizing 
key 
government 
functions went 
into 
effect, 
the 
health 
system 
in 
Indonesia 
has 
faced serious challenges 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
health 
financing 
and 
the delivery 
of 
essential 
health 
services. 
The Bank 
supports 
the Government's 
decentralization 
process 
as 
a 
means 
to 
enable 
provinces 
and 
districts 
to: 
(a) 
strengthen the 
respective 
roles 
of 
providers, 
consumers 
and 
other 
related 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
health 
care 
system; 
(b) 
establish 
collaborative 
management 
of 
health 
care 
delivery 
through 
evidence-based analysis 
of 
health 
needs 
and 
agreed-upon 
priorities 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources; 
and 
(c) 
institute 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
accountability 
for 
adequate services 
for 
the 
poor 
commensurate 
with 
their 
needs 
and 
service preferences. 
Specifically, 
the 
Health 
Workforce 
and 
Services 
Project would: 
(i) 
improve 
financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
essential 
health 
services 
to 
enhance 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
to 
promote 
improved 
health 
outcomes 
at 
the 
district 
level; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
health 
work 
force 
policy, 
management and 
development 
in 
a decentralized 
context 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
allocational efficiencies and 
equity 
in 
the 
distribution 
and 
use 
of 
health 
resources 
within 
the 
provinces. 
A 
corollary 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
enable 
key 
sectoral 
stakeholders, 
including 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH), 
the 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education 
(MONE) 
and 
the Indonesian 
Medical 
Association 
(IMA), 
to: 
(i) 
redefine their 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
vis-&vis 
health 
work 
force 
policy, planning 
and 
management; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
their 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
effective 
stewardship 
in 
fulfilling 
the 
functions 
of 
policy 
making, legislation, 
regulation, 
quality 
assurancekontrol 
and

A.1. 
Improved 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
Bank 
support 
for 
improved 
service 
delivery 
at 
district 
level 
will 
be 
based on: 
(a) 
the 
health 
development 
master 
plan 
and 
annual health 
plan 
developed 
by 
the 
district, 
endorsed 
by 
the 
District 
Health Council 
(DHC), and 
approved 
by 
the 
Joint 
Health 
Council; 
and 
(b) 
the 
use 
of 
block 
grants 
or 
District 
Funding 
Allocation 
(DFA) 
for 
increased 
efficiency 
in 
resource 
allocation 
and 
utilization. 
Procedures 
for 
accessing 
and 
disbursing 
the 
DFA 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
District 
Funding 
Allocation 
Manual. 
Attachment

responsibilities. 
Annual 
proposals 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
address: 
(a) 
access 
and 
quality 
of 
services; 
(b) 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure the 
equity 
and 
sustainability 
of 
health 
care 
improvements: and 
(c) 
modalities 
for 
strengthening the decentralized 
management 
of 
health 
administration. 
Proposal 
review 
will 
adhere 
to 
two 
essential 
principles: 
e 
The 
district 
allocation 
will 
require 
that 
proposals demonstrate: 
(a) 
a 
strengthened 
evidentiary 
basis 
for 
evaluating 
the 
district's health 
status 
and 
priority 
problems; 
(b) 
improved planning 
practices 
to 
link 
annual 
updates 
of 
the master 
plan 
to 
the 
annual planning; and 
(c) 
better 
financial 
information 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
stakeholder 
contributions 
to 
the annual 
district 
plan 
are 
included 
in 
the 
proposed 
budget. 
The review criteria (which may 
evolve 
over 
the 
period 
of 
the 
project) 
will 
need 
to 
address: 
(a) 
the comprehensiveness 
of 
the 
proposal; 
(b) 
its 
adherence 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
equity, 
efficiency, quality, 
and 
sustainability 
advanced 
in 
the 
Government's 
PIP; 
(c) 
the 
feasibility 
of 
the 
proposed 
activities 
and budgets 
on 
the basis 
of 
past 
performance 
and current 
staffing; 
and 
(d) 
evidence 
of 
consideration 
for 
the 
issues 
of 
poverty, 
gender, 
and indigenous 
peoples. 
e 
Because 
these 
plans 
are 
expected 
to 
vary 
from 
district 
to 
district 
and 
to 
change 
with 
the 
evolving 
priorities 
of 
the district, 
the 
range 
of 
activities 
described 
in 
the

below 
will

provide 
an

diseases 
(including 
malaria 
and 
dengue, 
tuberculosis, 
STDMV, 
etc.); 
promote health 
information 
and education; and 
strengthen 
environmental health 
(including 
water 
and 
sanitation). 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
minor 
civil 
works 
limited 
to 
sub-health centers 
(pustus) 
and 
health 
centers 
(puskesmas), 
appropriate 
medical 
equipment and 
transport, 
and incremental 
costs 
for 
supplies 
and 
operations. 
Through 
the 
DFA, 
the 
project 
would 
finance 
both 
pre-service 
training 
of 
medical 
(Sl) 
and 
paramedical 
(D3 
and 
D4) 
personnel and 
in-service 
training 
across 
a range 
of 
subjects 
comprising 
health 
service 
delivery 
(preventive, curative, and 
emergency services) 
and 
health 
system 
administration 
and 
management. 
In 
addition, 
to improve 
the 
quality 
of 
hospital-based 
care, 
districts 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
pilot 
program 
to 
train 
health 
care specialists 
(in 
the 
areas 
of 
pediatrics, 
internal 
medicine, 
obstetrics and gynecology, and general 
surgery) 
and 
supporting 
specialties 
(radiology, 
anesthesiology, 
and pathology) 
in 
district 
hospitals. 
Under 
Component 
C, 
a 
competency-based 
curriculum 
and 
training 
program 
will 
be: 
(a) 
developed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
specialist 
Collegia 
under 
MA 
and 
(b) 
delivered 
with 
participation 
from 
specialists 
based 
in 
provincial 
training 
hospitals 
and rotations 
of 
district-based 
specialists 
in 
provincial 
hospitals. 
The 
pilot 
program 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
selected 
districts 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
finance the scholarship 
costs 
of 
staff 
to 
be trained through 
local 
funds 
or 
the 
DFA. 
Finally, 
under 
Component 
C, the 
project 
will 
pilot 
in 
two 
districts 
in 
West 
Sumatera 
and 
West 
Kalimantan, 
in 
partnership 
with 
MA, 
MOH, 
MONE 
and 
district 
and 
provincial level 
governments, 
a 
service 
delivery 
model 
based 
on 
the 
family 
physician 
practicing 
in 
an 
integrated 
and 
structured 
system 
with 
effective 
referral 
and 
payment 
mechanisms, 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
equity 
of 
service 
delivery 
and meet 
population 
needs. 
To 
ensure 
integration 
into 
the 
health 
care 
system, 
the 
pilot 
demonstration 
project 
will 
involve 
MENPAN 
on 
civil 
service 
reforms 
to 
facilitate 
recruitment 
and 
remuneration 
mechanisms. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
pilot 
project; 
expansion 
of 
the 
pilot 
to 
other 
districts 
would 
be funded through 
the 
DFA.

Mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
equitv 
and 
sustainabilitv. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
efforts 
to 
develop 
sustainable 
financial 
arrangements 
(through a 
mix of 
local, central 
and 
external 
funding) 
and 
to 
promote 
schemes 
to 
improve overall 
equity 
and 
access 
of 
the 
poor to 
health 
services. 
Districts 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
finance 
data 
collection 
on 
sustainability 
through 
the annual 
district 
health 
account exercise; 
through 
Component 
B, 
the 
project 
would 
finance 
districts' 
participation 
in 
studies 
(on 
utilization 
of 
services, 
tariff 
levels, 
etc.) 
and 
pilot 
programs (on 
community financing, health 
insurance, 
etc.), 
study 
tours 
within 
Indonesia, 
and 
workshops 
to 
discuss the 
results 
of 
studies, 
potentially innovative 
schemes, 
etc. 
Decentralized 
management 
of 
health 
services. 
The 
project 
would 
support the 
District 
Health 
Office's 
ability 
to 
promote 
cross-sectoral 
cooperation and 
stakeholder 
participation (including 
the 
District 
Health 
Council); 
to 
prepare strategic and 
annual 
health 
development 
plans; 
to 
analyze, negotiate, 
and 
convince 
Bupati 
and 
local 
parliament 
members 
to 
obtain 
adequate 
financing; 
and 
to 
strengthen 
health 
information 
systems 
to monitor 
health 
service 
outputs and 
evaluate 
performance. 
The project 
would 
finance 
minor 
civil 
works 
and 
equipment 
for DHO, 
transport 
for 
supervision, 
training 
in 
health 
administration 
and 
management 
(including 
planning, 
HR 
management, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management, 
health 
information 
systems, 
operations 
research, 
etc.), 
and 
incremental 
costs 
(for 
periodic 
meetings, 
supervision, 
etc.). 
A.2. 
Project 
management. 
As 
indicated 
in 
Attachment 
2, 
project 
management 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
District 
Implementation 
Unit. 
Supervised 
by 
the 
District 
Bappeda, the 
DIU 
would 
function 
as 
the 
district 
level 
project 
secretariat 
and 
handle 
administration,  procurement, 
financing, 
disbursement, 
and 
the 
reporting 
of 
project activities according 
to 
the 
project 
management 
manual. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
minor office 
equipment, 
training 
limited to 
project 
implementation, 
consultant 
services 
on 
a 
case 
by 
case 
basis, 
and 
operational 
costs (salaries, stationery, 
communications, 
etc.). 
Project 
Component

US$28.96 
million 
Component 
B: 
Provincial 
Health 
Offices 
and 
Health 
Facilities 
(Loadcredit 
amount: 
US$9.07 
million) 
The Provincial 
Health Office 
has 
direct responsibilities 
for 
ensuring 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
district 
and 
provincial 
health 
workforce 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
population's 
demand 
for 
increased 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
PHO's 
new 
responsibilities 
under 
decentralization 
to provide 
technical 
and 
administrative 
support 
to 
the 
Districts for: 
(a) 
strengthening 
health 
workforce 
management 
and 
training 
capacities; 
and 
(b) 
improving 
the 
coordination, 
planning, 
and 
management 
of 
health 
sector 
resources. 
As 
indicated 
in 
Attachment 
3, 
the 
project 
would 
also 
provide 
resources 
for 
project 
management 
at 
provincial level 
through 
the 
Provincial Coordination 
and 
Implementation 
Unit 
(PCIU). 
B.l. 
Health 
workforce 
development. 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
objectives 
of 
health 
work 
force 
planning 
and 
management 
by: 
(i) 
adapting 
the 
minimum 
service 
standards 
to local 
conditions and 
means; 
(ii) 
determining 
the 
numbers, 
skills, 
and specializations 
of 
existing 
and 
future health 
work 
forces 
needed 
at 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels; 
and 
(iii) 
implementing 
measures 
to 
ensure 
appropriate numbers 
of 
adequately 
trained 
staff 
in 
the 
health 
facilities. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
studies, 
pilot 
tests, 
and operational 
research 
concerning incentives 
and 
motivation, performance 
appraisals, 
and 
other 
initiatives 
for 
improving 
workforce 
performance. 
Minimum 
service 
standards. 
Based 
on 
minimum 
standards 
for 
service 
delivery currently 
being 
developed 
by 
MOH, 
the 
project 
will 
finance the 
analysis 
of 
epidemiological 
and 
service 
delivery 
data 
to 
adapt the 
minimum 
packages 
to 
the 
specific 
provincial 
and 
district 
context; 
and 
the 
dissemination 
of 
these 
standards 
to 
health 
personnel and 
to 
interested 
health 
officials 
and 
local 
authorities. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
help 
provinces define 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
for 
service 
delivery 
in 
health 
facilities 
- 
53 
- 
Page  58
and 
use 
the 
service 
standards 
to 
define 
roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
functions 
of 
health 
care 
personnel 
to 
ensure the 
quality 
of 
services 
provided.  The 
project 
will 
finance consultant 
services, studies, 
workshops 
and 
instructional 
materials. 
Workforce 
management 
systems. 
The 
project 
would 
support strengthening 
of 
SIMKA, 
the 
existing 
personnel 
information 
and 
management 
system 
initiated 
under 
HP 
5. 
The project 
would 
also 
develop the capacity 
to 
analyze 
the 
current 
and 
future 
requirements 
for 
health 
manpower development 
and 
to 
prepare scenarios 
(including 
retraining, 
redeployment, 
downsizing, 
etc.) 
for 
increasing 
the 
allocational 
efficiency 
and effectiveness 
of 
human 
resources. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
limited 
hardware and 
software, studies 
and consultant 
services, 
training, 
workshops, 
and 
operational 
costs 
associated 
with 
implementing 
measures 
which 
may be 
decided 
on. 
Coordination 
of 
long-term 
and 
in-service training. 
The 
project 
will 
improve 
the 
PHOs' 
ability 
to 
assist 
DHOs 
in 
assessing 
health 
work 
forces 
training 
needs 
capacity and 
service 
gaps; 
finance 
appropriate 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
training 
capabilities 
at 
provincial 
level; 
and 
provide 
regular, 
systematic, 
and 
quality training 
courses 
(many 
of 
which 
are 
probably more 
appropriately 
and 
efficiently 
offered 
at 
provincial 
level). 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
civil 
works 
and pedagogical equipment 
for 
provincial 
training facilities 
(poltekes 
and 
bapelkes); 
fellowships; 
teacher, 
TOT 
and technical training; 
books and 
instructional 
materials; and operational 
costs 
(for 
stationary and 
supplies, 
field 
research, etc.). 
Potential 
training 
activities 
might 
include 
family 
health, emergency 
medicine, 
referral 
system, 
clinical 
slulls, 
health 
services management, 
epidemiology, health 
insurance 
and 
health 
care 
financing, 
hospital 
management, 
autonomous 
public 
health 
care management, 
and other relevant 
fields. 
In 
addition, 
the 
PHO 
will 
also assist 
DHO's 
by 
coordinating 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
pilot 
training program 
for 
the 
district 
hospital-based 
health 
care specialists. 
Finally, 
the 
PHOs 
will 
also 
be responsible 
for initiating 
contact 
with 
the 
various 
potential 
universities, 
both 
domestic and foreign, 
to 
obtain 
information 
about 
training 
programs 
(in 
public 
health, 
health 
policy, 
health 
economics, 
health 
services management, 
etc.) 
offered 
and available 
at 
the 
universities. 
The 
objective 
will 
be 
to 
build 
a 
network 
with 
selected 
universities 
capable 
of 
providing 
short 
or 
long-term training 
on 
a 
contractual 
basis. 
The project 
would 
finance operational 
costs 
(communications, 
travel, 
etc.) 
associated 
with 
establishing the 
network 
as 
well 
as 
fellowships or 
contractual 
services 
as 
needed 
to 
provide 
the 
training. 
B.2. 
Health 
system 
coordination, 
planning and 
management. 
The 
project 
would 
support the 
PHO's 
role 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
of 
importance 
for 
strengthening 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
districts. 
Generally, the 
project 
would 
finance 
minor 
civil 
works and 
equipment 
for 
the 
PHO, 
transport 
for 
supervision, 
training 
in 
health administration 
and 
management 
(including 
planning, 
HR 
management, 
procurement and 
financial 
management, 
health 
information 
systems, 
operations 
research, 
etc.), 
and 
incremental 
costs 
(for 
periodic 
meetings, 
supervision, 
etc.). 
Specifically, 
while 
health manpower 
development 
is 
a 
primary 
responsibility, 
the 
Province 
has 
other 
explicit 
authorities 
under 
Regulation 
25 
to: 
(a) 
determine guidelines 
for 
health 
information 
and 
education 
campaigns; 
and 
(b) 
monitor 
the 
epidemiological situation 
and prepare 
for 
outbreaks 
and 
epidemics. 
In 
addition, there 
are 
currently 
two 
areas 
where 
the 
project 
proposes 
to 
support 
the 
PHO 
(even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
explicit provincial 
authority) 
because 
provincial 
intervention 
should result 
in 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient 
operations at 
district 
level; 
(c) cross-sectoral 
cooperation and health 
development 
planning 
(where the 
district 
alone retains 
these 
authorities); 
and 
(d) 
health 
system 
financing 
(where 
central 
and 
district 
levels 
have 
authority 
but 
the 
provincial level 
does 
not).

Health 
information, 
education, 
and 
promotion. 
In 
collaboration 
with 
other 
actors 
involved 
in 
health promotion, 
the 
provincial 
health 
education 
unit 
will: 
(a) 
manage 
province-wide 
advocacy 
efforts 
to 
promote 
awareness 
on 
health 
issues 
of 
importance 
to local 
authorities, 
consumers, 
and providers: 
(b) 
coordinate 
health 
education 
campaigns 
on 
specific 
diseases 
and behaviors 
among 
schools 
and 
higher 
learning institutions, 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups, 
and 
private 
sector associations 
and 
groups: and 
(c) 
organize 
efforts to 
strengthen consumer 
awareness 
and 
public 
accountability 
for 
the 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
The 
project 
would 
finance consultant 
services, 
training 
and 
workshops, 
materials 
production 
and dissemination, 
studies, 
and operational 
costs associated 
with 
implementing promotional 
campaigns. 
Epidemiological 
surveillance and outbreak 
response. 
The project 
would 
promote 
the 
adaptation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
integrated 
surveillance system 
currently 
being 
implemented 
in 
other 
provinces 
with 
ADB 
and 
PHP-II 
support. 
With 
guidance, support, 
and 
supervision 
from 
central 
level, 
PHO's 
would 
create 
or 
strengthen 
epidemiological 
surveillance 
teams 
(EST) and establish linkages 
with 
district 
(DEST) and health 
center 
(TEPUS) surveillance 
teams. 
Together 
these teams 
would 
provide information 
for 
greater evidence-based 
decision-making, 
detect trends 
and 
key 
determinants 
of 
disease 
incidence, 
and 
provide 
leadership 
in 
planning prompt 
and corrective 
actions 
through the 
Early 
Warning 
Outbreaks 
Response 
System (EWORS). 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
equipment, 
transport, 
consultant 
services, 
training 
and 
workshops, studies, 
and operational 
costs associated 
with 
information 
gathering 
(forms, 
instructional 
materials), 
dissemination, 
and 
outbreak 
response 
planning. 
Cooperation 
and 
health 
development 
planning. 
To 
strengthen 
the respective 
roles 
of 
district 
authorities 
(Bupatis), 
public 
and 
private 
providers, 
consumers 
and other interested 
stakeholders 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
decentralized 
health 
care 
system, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
establishment and 
operation 
of 
the 
Joint 
Health 
Council. 
As 
indicated 
in 
Attachment 
3, 
the 
role 
of 
JHC 
is: 
(i) 
to 
strengthen 
health 
system 
governance 
at 
the 
provincial level 
by 
instituting 
a 
new 
management 
structure 
for 
pluralistic 
decision-making 
for 
planning 
and resource 
allocation:  and 
(ii) 
to 
provide 
overall 
guidance 
to 
project 
implementation. 
In 
addition 
to 
incidental 
meeting 
costs, 
the 
project 
would 
also 
finance 
workshops 
(to 
discuss the 
roles, 
responsibility, 
and mechanism 
of 
the 
council) 
and 
field 
visits 
to 
various locations 
to 
familiarize 
the 
council 
with 
health conditions 
and 
related 
issues. 
The 
JHC 
would rely 
on 
support 
from 
the 
Technical 
Review Team 
to: 
(i) 
determine 
district 
budget 
ceilings 
based 
on 
criteria 
agreed 
by 
the 
Bank: 
(ii) 
review 
and approve proposals 
to 
receive 
District 
Funding 
Allocations; and 
(iii) 
monitor 
implementation 
progress. 
To 
advance 
the 
work 
of 
the 
TRT, 
the 
project 
would 
finance 
operational 
costs 
associated 
with 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
in 
preparing 
and 
reviewing 
the 
proposals 
and 
with 
supervising 
implementation 
(travel and meeting 
costs, 
stationary, 
etc.). 
Training, 
annual 
implementation 
reviews, 
and 
planning 
workshops 
could 
also 
be 
financed. 
To 
operationalize 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 
JHC, 
the 
project 
will: 
(a) 
strengthen 
the medium-term 
and 
annual 
planning 
process 
with 
evidence-based 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
guidelines: 
and 
(b) 
improve 
the 
collection, 
analysis, 
and 
use 
of 
information 
related 
to 
health 
services 
outputs 
and health 
status 
outcomes 
in 
decision-making 
about 
future 
directions 
for 
provincial 
health 
development. 
While 
DHO's would 
focus 
on 
annual 
planning, 
the 
PHO 
would 
emphasize 
medium-term, strategic 
planning 
issues 
(of 
infrastructure, 
finances 
and personnel) 
to 
mobilize 
additional financial 
resources, 
inform 
districts 
of 
program 
priorities, 
and ensure 
that 
equity 
in 
the 
development 
of 
health 
services 
is 
kept 
in 
mind. 
The project 
would 
finance 
training 
and 
workshops, 
and operational 
costs associated 
with 
planning 
(travel, 
forms and 
guidelines, 
etc.). 
Health 
svstem 
financing. 
On 
balance, 
health 
services 
have 
been 
severely 
under funded 
in 
Indonesia, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
local 
governments have 
lacked 
the 
financial 
resources 
to 
attract 
key 
-

Page  60
personnel (physicians, 
nurses and 
mid-wives) 
in 
adequate 
numbers, 
to 
initiate 
essential 
health 
programs 
and 
services 
to 
address 
local 
health 
needs, 
and 
to 
finance health 
services 
for 
the 
vulnerable 
groups such 
as 
the poor, 
women, 
children, 
and the 
elderly. 
The 
project 
would 
focus 
attention 
on 
health financing 
information, 
and 
specifically 
the 
district 
health 
account 
so 
as 
to 
better examine 
health 
financing

Project 
Management 
Structure 
This 
section 
summarizes 
the 
management 
structure 
for 
project 
activities 
at 
the 
district, 
provincial 
and central 
levels. 
District 
level 
1. 
A 
District 
Health 
Council, 
DHC, 
would 
be 
established 
by 
the 
respective 
Bupati 
in 
each 
District. 
The 
DHC 
would 
consist 
of 
8 
to 
10 
people 
and 
would 
comprise 
members 
of 
Dinas 
Kesehatan, 
NGOs 
and Community-based Organizations (CBOs) 
including 
woman organization 
representatives, 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
DPRD from 
commissions 
of 
social 
welfare, budget 
and 
development. 
The 
role 
of 
DHC 
is 
two-fold: 
(i) 
to 
strengthen 
health 
system 
governance 
at 
the 
district 
level 
by 
instituting 
a 
new 
management 
structure 
for 
pluralistic 
decision-making 
for 
planning 
and 
resource 
allocation; 
and 
(ii) 
to 
provide overall 
guidance 
to project 
implementation. 
DHC will 
act 
as 
a 
forum for 
raising 
health 
issues, 
determining broad 
health policies, 
and seeking 
consensus 
on 
and endorsing 
health 
priorities 
and 
how 
best 
to 
use 
district’s health 
resources 
as 
per 
the annual proposals 
for 
district 
funding 
allocation. 
It 
will 
meet 
at 
least 
four 
times a 
year. 
2. 
District 
Bupatis. 
DIUs 
would 
be 
headed 
by 
the 
head 
of 
the 
District 
Bappeda and 
managed 
by 
an 
Executive 
Secretary 
in 
hisher 
capacity 
as 
head 
of 
the 
district 
health 
office. 
Starting 
in 
FY 
2004 
and 
for 
each subsequent 
fiscal 
year, 
a 
major 
task 
of 
the 
DIUs 
would be 
to 
coordinate the development 
of 
a 
consolidated 
annual 
district 
health 
plan 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
five-year 
master 
plan. 
The 
DIUs 
would 
function 
as 
the 
district 
level 
project 
secretariats 
and 
handle 
administration,  procurement, 
financing, 
disbursement, 
and 
the 
reporting 
of 
project 
activities according 
to 
a 
Project 
Management 
Manual. 
Afinal 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
is 
a 
condition 
for 
Project 
EfSectiveness. 
The 
DIUs 
would 
consist 
of 
one 
procurement 
officer, 
one 
financial officer, 
one 
planning officer, 
and 
one 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
officer. 
District 
Implementation 
Units, 
DIUs 
have 
been 
established 
prior 
to 
Negotiations 
by 
the 
3. 
by 
the 
district, 
and 
submitted 
by 
the 
head 
of 
the 
district 
health 
office 
after 
endorsement 
by 
the 
District 
Health Council 
(DHC). 
Proposals 
would 
be 
in 
a 
format 
specified 
in 
a 
District Funding 
Allocation 
Manual. 
This 
manual 
would 
detail 
eligible 
expenditures under the 
District 
Funding 
Allocations, the 
proposals procedure 
and 
schedule, 
responsibilities 
for 
preparation 
and the 
review 
process 
including 
evaluation criteria, contracting 
procedures, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management, 
and 
reporting 
and 
monitoring 
requirements. 
An 
attachment 
to 
the 
manual 
will 
detail 
safeguard 
policies 
on 
environmental 
management, 
indigenous 
peoples, 
and pest 
management. 
It 
will 
also 
include 
as 
attachment 
an 
evaluation 
score 
sheet 
which would 
include 
guiding 
principles 
and 
broad criteria 
(equitable 
access 
in 
relation to 
gender, 
vulnerable 
peoples, 
etc.) 
against 
which 
district 
proposals 
will 
be 
assessed 
for 
no-objection 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Proposals 
for District 
Funding 
Allocations 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
annual 
health 
plans developed 
4. 
Allocations 
by 
entering 
into 
sub-project contracts 
with 
eligible 
providers, 
public or 
private 
(both 
for-profit 
and 
not-for-profit, 
such 
as 
some 
NGOs). 
The 
DIUs 
would 
handle 
the 
invitation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
bids, 
or 
sub-contract 
the process 
to 
qualified 
procurement 
agents chosen 
through 
a 
competitive 
process. 
Detailed 
procedures 
would 
be specified 
in 
the 
Project 
Management 
Manual. 
Regardless 
of 
size, 
contracting 
would 
be 
undertaken 
for 
civil 
works, 
goods, 
services 
and 
consultants, 
using 
procurement 
The 
DIUs 
would 
be

bidding 
documents acceptable 
to 
the 
Association/Bank. 
Provincial 
Level 
5. 
A 
Joint 
Health 
Council, 
JHC, 
would 
be 
established 
by 
the 
respective 
Governor 
in 
each 
participating 
province. 
The 
JHC 
would 
be 
a standing committee, 
meeting 
a 
minimum 
of 
four 
times a 
year 
as 
a 
forum for 
raising 
health 
issues 
and 
determining broad health 
policies 
for 
the 
province. 
The 
JHC 
would 
consist 
of 
15 
to 
20 
people 
and 
would 
comprise 
of 
Bupatis 
or 
their 
designates, members 
of 
civil 
society, 
including 
woman 
organizations, 
local 
health 
experts, representatives 
of 
professional 
organizations, and 
local 
health 
professionals 
including 
those 
from 
the 
private 
sector. 
Members 
of 
the 
JHC 
would 
be 
funded 
by 
non-AssociatiodBank 
sources. 
As 
with 
DHC, 
the 
role 
of 
JHC 
is 
two-fold: 
(i) 
to 
strengthen 
health 
system 
governance 
at 
the 
provincial level 
by 
instituting 
a 
new 
management 
structure 
for 
pluralistic 
decision-making 
for 
planning 
and 
resource 
allocation;  and 
(ii) 
to 
provide overall 
guidance 
to 
project 
implementation. 
In 
addition, 
JHCs 
will 
act 
as 
a 
forum 
for 
raising 
health 
issues 
at the 
provincial 
level 
by 
identifying 
those 
which 
are 
not properly 
dealt 
with 
at 
the 
district 
level, 
or 
others 
which 
are 
dealt 
with 
in 
an 
inefficient 
way, 
either 
because 
of 
duplications 
in 
financing 
and 
service 
provision, 
lack 
of 
proper referral 
mechanisms, 
or 
lack 
of 
economies 
of 
scale 
at 
lower 
levels. 
As 
for 
project 
implementation 
proper, the 
tasks 
of 
the 
JHC 
would 
include: 
(i) 
determining 
district 
budget 
ceilings 
based 
on 
criteria 
agreed 
by 
the 
Bank; 
(ii) 
review 
and 
approval 
of 
proposals 
for 
District 
Funding 
Allocations; 
and 
(iii) 
monitoring 
implementation 
progress.

provincial 
health 
department, 
would 
review district 
proposals. 
In 
addition to 
the 
review 
function, 
the 
TRT 
in 
the 
provincial 
health 
office 
(Dinas 
Kesehatan 
Propinsi) 
would 
provide 
technical 
support 
to 
the 
districts 
in 
the 
development 
of 
proposals. 
The 
TRT 
would 
be 
reinforced 
as 
needed 
by 
health 
specialists 
to 
be 
hired 
as 
consultants 
to 
supplement 
the 
available 
expertise 
and 
slull 
mix. 
A 
Technical Review 
Team, 
TRT, 
comprised 
of 
8 
to 
10 
health 
professionals and 
located 
in 
the 
7. 
the 
ceiling 
to 
be determined 
by 
the JHCs 
according 
to criteria 
accepted 
by 
the 
AssociatiodBank. 
To 
ensure 
funds 
were 
not underutilized 
and 
to 
act 
as 
an 
incentive 
to good 
proposal preparation 
and 
implementation, 
funds 
would 
be reallocated 
to 
stronger 
performers 
when 
proposals 
for 
a 
lesser 
amount 
than 
the agreed 
ceiling 
were 
presented, 
or 
when 
the 
review 
of 
a 
district 
proposal 
recommended 
not 
funding 
all 
proposed 
activities, 
or 
recommended 
funding 
the 
proposed activities 
with 
a 
reduced 
budget. 
Detailed 
procedures 
for 
reallocation 
will 
be 
contained 
in 
the 
District Funding Allocation 
Manual. 
The 
JHC 
acting 
on 
the advice 
of 
the 
TRT 
would 
award annual 
District 
Funding 
Allocations

This 
unit 
would 
be chaired 
by 
the head 
of 
the 
provincial 
Bappeda, 
with 
the head 
of 
the 
provincial 
health 
office 
as 
Deputy 
Project 
Director.  The 
PCIU 
would 
be 
supervised 
by 
a 
full-time 
Executive 
Secretary 
with 
appropriate 
sector 
and 
management experience. 
The 
PCIU 
would 
employ 
at 
least 
one 
procurement 
officer, 
one 
financial officer, 
one 
planning officer, 
and 
one 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
officer. 
Training 
in 
procurement, 
finance 
and 
reporting 
procedures 
would 
be 
the 
first 
activity 
after project 
effectiveness. 
Annual 
Procurement 
Plans 
would 
be 
prepared under 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
Bank 
Procurement Specialist. 
The 
PCIU 
would 
provide 
for 
Bank 
review biannual 
consolidated 
implementation,  procurement 
and 
financial 
reports 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
District 
Funding 
Allocation 
Manual. 
Finally, 
the 
PCIU 
will 
act 
as 
the 
conduit 
between 
DIUs, 
JHCs and the 
Bank for 
review 
of 
DFAs 
and 
project 
supervision. 
A 
Provincial 
Coordination Implementation 
Unit, 
PCIU, 
would 
be 
established 
in 
each 
of 
the

which 
economies 
of 
scale and/or 
the systemic 
nature 
of 
the 
activities 
indicated 
that

Analysis 
Summary 
INDONESIA: 
Health Workforce and Services 
Introduction 
This 
annex presents the 
economic 
analysis 
of 
Health Workforce 
and 
Services 
Project. 
The 
project 
supports 
districts 
in 
four 
provinces 
in 
their efforts 
to 
set 
up 
and 
adopt 
institutional 
and 
financial 
mechanisms 
for 
client-centered 
and 
sustainable 
health 
services 
financing 
and 
delivery 
in 
the 
context 
of 
decentralization. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
are 
to: 
(i) 
improve financing 
and 
delivery 
of 
essential 
health 
services 
in 
the provinces 
of 
Jambi, 
East 
Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, 
and 
West 
Sumatera 
to 
enhance 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
health 
outcomes 
at 
the 
district 
level; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
health 
work 
force 
policy, 
management 
and development 
in 
a decentralized 
setting 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
allocational efficiencies and 
equity 
in 
the 
distribution 
and 
use 
of 
health 
resources. 
A 
corollary 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH) 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education 
(MONE) 
to 
redefine their roles 
and 
responsibilities 
vis-&vis 
health 
work 
force 
policy, planning 
and 
management. 
The 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
project 
covers 
the 
following: 
(a) 
country 
assistance strategy goals 
and Indonesian 
health 
sector strategy goals 
supported 
by 
the 
project; 
(b) 
rationale 
for 
public 
sector 
involvement 
and 
poverty impact 
of 
the 
project; 
(c) cost 
benefit 
analysis 
of 
project 
interventions; 
(d) 
risk-sensitivity 
analysis; 
and 
(e) 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
project 
interventions. 
CAS 
and 
Health 
Sector 
Strategy 
Goals supported 
by 
the 
Project 
One 
of 
the 
priority 
areas 
for 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
Indonesia 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
CAS 
is 
“delivering 
better 
public 
services 
to 
the 
poor, 
which 
involves 
assistance 
to 
help 
define 
government 
roles and 
responsibilities 
as 
functions 
are 
decentralized, 
support 
for 
improved public 
service 
delivery 
by 
sub-national 
governments 
which 
have 
demonstrated 
pro-poor 
and 
growth reform, 
as 
well 
as 
promoting 
community 
development”. 
The 
CAS 
also underscores the 
importance 
of 
providing 
demand-responsive 
services, 
especially 
to 
the poor, 
to 
reduce 
poverty. 
In 
addition, 
it 
acknowledges that development 
of 
human capital 
at 
all 
levels 
is 
critical 
to 
sustain 
economic 
recovery 
and 
growth 
in 
Indonesia 
and 
emphasizes that 
decentralization 
of 
the 
delivery 
of 
most government 
services makes 
capacity 
building 
at 
all 
levels 
a 
priority. The 
project 
supports 
these 
goals 
by 
developing 
and 
implementing institutional 
and 
financial 
mechanisms 
at 
the 
district 
level 
to 
enhance 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
health 
outcomes 
as 
well 
as 
by 
defining 
the 
roles and responsibilities 
of 
each 
level 
- 
center, 
province, 
district 
and 
below 
and 
for 
private 
sector 
involvement and 
by 
building 
the 
capacity 
of 
health 
service managers 
at 
district 
and 
provincial 
levels 
to provide quality 
health 
services 
in 
the 
new 
decentralized environment. 
The Indonesia health 
sector strategy emphasizes 
decentralization 
as 
the 
new 
framework 
for, 
inter 
alia: 
(a) 
raising 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
providers 
in 
terms 
of 
training 
and 
capabilities; 
(b) 
providing 
workers 
with 
more demanding professional 
tasks 
and 
adequate 
facilities; 
(c) 
providing 
adequate 
compensation 
for 
those 
who 
perform; 
(d) 
building 
accountability 
by 
giving 
providers 
feedback; 
and 
(e) 
creating 
a 
facilitator function 
to 
help 
the 
poor 
articulate their 
voice. 
The project 
aims 
at addressing 
these 
issues 
in 
a 
coordinated fashion 
by: 
(i) 
building 
up 
new 
and 
strengthening 
existing regional 
structures and 
institutions 
for 
improved 
health 
sector governance; 
(ii) 
reshaping 
accountability 
in 
decision 
making 
by 
including 
clients 
and 
providers through 
various 
mechanisms; 
(iii) 
bringing 
forth 
consumer needs 
and 
preferences 
explicitly 
into 
health 
services 
planning; 
and 
(iv) attuning 
health 
work 
force 
training 
and 
performance 
issues 
to regional 
context and 
imperatives.

Rationale 
for 
public 
sector 
investment 
and 
poverty 
impact 
Province 
The project 
focuses 
on improving 
the 
role 
of 
government 
in 
the sector 
in 
the 
new 
decentralized 
context. 
It 
assists 
the 
government 
in 
its 
stewardship 
role 
in 
policy, 
planning, 
management and 
regulation 
of 
the 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
a 
provider 
and 
financier 
of 
public 
health 
services 
and 
essential 
health 
services 
for 
the 
poor. 
In 
service 
provision, 
it 
focuses 
on improving 
the 
quality 
of 
primary 
health 
care 
and 
public 
health 
services 
at 
the 
district 
level, especially 
targeting 
the 
poor. 
In 
addition, the 
project 
will 
also 
address 
the 
increasingly important 
role 
that the 
private health 
sector, 
the 
professional 
associations, 
and 
civil 
society 
play 
in 
the 
organization 
and 
governance 
of 
the 
health 
system. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved at 
the 
various levels 
of 
the 
Government 
through 
various 
means. 
At 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
project 
will 
assist 
IMA 
to 
strengthen 
its 
institutional 
roles 
and 
responsibilities regarding 
membership, 
regulation 
of 
the 
medical 
practice 
and 
its 
environment, 
mechanisms 
to 
handle 
grievances 
and professional 
malfeasance 
through 
peer 
review: 
develop 
its 
capacity 
to provide 
in-service training, 
networking 
and 
dissemination 
of 
current 
information on 
medical 
practice; 
set 
standards 
for 
medical 
education, 
practice 
and 
ethics; 
and 
reinforce 
its 
position 
of 
advocacy 
in 
regulatory 
matters, 
licensing 
and 
accreditation 
issue. 
At 
the 
district 
level, 
while 
health 
services 
will 
be financed largely through 
a 
mix 
of 
central, 
local 
and 
extemal 
funding, 
the 
project 
will 
encourage the 
use 
of 
alternative 
means 
of 
providing 
health 
services 
including 
contracting 
with 
private 
doctors. 
Urban 
Rural 
Total 
The 
economic 
crisis 
in 
1997 
resulted 
in 
a 
deterioration 
in 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
people 
of 
Indonesia. 
While 
since 
then 
the 
country 
has 
been 
experiencing reductions 
in 
expenditure 
poverty, 
recent 
analyses 
indicate 
that almost 
half 
the 
population 
is 
still 
very 
vulnerable. 
A 
study 
of 
the 
measurement 
of 
poverty 
(Pradhan, 
Suryahadi, Sumarto and Pritchett, 
2000), 
indicates that 
all 
provinces 
in 
Indonesia 
experienced 
an increase 
in 
poverty 
incidence 
in 
between 
February 
1996 
and 
1999. 
The poverty 
incidence 
in 
February 
1999, 
in 
the 
project 
provinces 
were 
-West 
Kalimantan 
(30.76%), 
East 
Kalimantan 
(21.67%), 
Jambi 
(22.18%) 
and West 
Sumatera (9.47%) 
- 
respectively, 
with 
a 
national 
average 
of 
27.13%. 
Recent 
poverty 
figures 
indicate 
that 
poverty 
incidence 
in 
Indonesia 
has 
declined 
from 
the 
peak 
crisis 
level 
to 
16% 
in 
February 
2002. 
The 
percentage 
point 
increase 
in 
poverty 
incidence 
for 
the 
four 
provinces 
between February 
1996 and 
February 
1999 
is 
illustrated 
in 
Table 
4.1. 
The project 
will 
provide 
targeted 
subsidies 
to 
poor 
areas 
in 
the 
four 
provinces 
covered under 
the 
project, 
and 
assist 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
health 
care 
financing 
system 
for 
the 
poor.

A 
traditional 
static 
benefit- 
incidence 
analysis 
of 
public 
spending 
in 
health (Lanjouw, 
Pradhan, 
Saadah, 
Sayed 
and Sparrow 
2001), 
found 
that spending 
on primary 
health 
care tends 
to 
be 
pro-poor. 
In 
addition 
the 
marginal 
and 
average 
incidence 
analysis  show 
that 
the greatest 
benefit to 
the 
poor 
would 
come 
from 
an 
increase 
in 
primary 
health 
care 
spending 
which 
is 
what 
the 
project 
supports.

Analysis 
of 
Alternatives 
Several alternatives 
were considered, 
including 
maintaining 
the 
status 
quo 
and 
maintaining 
the 
design 
of 
the 
provincial 
health 
projects. 
Maintaining 
the 
status 
quo 
could 
not 
be 
an 
alternative 
in 
times 
of 
change 
- 
this 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
loss 
in 
the 
momentum 
for reforming 
the sector 
to improve 
effectiveness and service 
quality. 
Decentralization provides 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
to 
do 
away 
with 
top-down 
and technocratic mode 
of 
policy 
making 
and 
regulation, and 
to 
adopt 
a 
more 
pluralistic 
mode 
involving 
civil 
society and 
health 
care 
professionals. 
In 
addition, 
during 
the 
recent economic 
crisis 
it 
has 
become 
clear that 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
hard-pressed and 
unable 
to 
maintain 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
funding 
to 
provide 
health 
care services, 
let 
alone 
cover 
additional 
expenses 
brought 
about 
by 
decentralization, 
such 
as 
increased 
in-service 
training 
needs 
and 
loss 
of 
economies 
of 
scale due 
to duplication 
of 
some 
essential services 
at 
all 
levels. 
Therefore 
the 
project 
aims 
to 
seize 
the 
momentum 
to: 
(i) 
introduce 
and 
experiment 
with 
novel 
policy 
development, 
financing, 
management 
and 
service 
delivery 
models and 
mechanisms; 
and 
(ii) 
redefine 
the 
scope 
and 
mix 
of 
services 
to 
be produced 
locally 
in 
accordance 
with 
variations 
in 
health 
and 
health 
care 
needs 
across 
the 
country. 
In 
fact, 
the 
project 
expands 
on 
the 
existing 
design 
of 
the 
provincial 
health 
projects. 
It 
contains 
all 
the 
main 
components 
of 
the 
provincial 
health 
projects 
necessary 
to 
protect 
essential 
health 
services 
for 
the 
poor 
and 
to 
strengthen 
decentralized 
management 
through 
institutional 
build-up. 
In 
addition, 
it 
includes 
an 
added 
component 
of 
human 
resources 
development 
policy 
and 
planning 
aimed 
at 
achieving 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
skill 
mix 
in 
health 
system 
management 
and service 
provision. 
Work 
force 
issues, 
ranging 
from 
training 
through 
deployment, retention, compensation 
to 
incentives 
are 
key 
to 
building 
local 
capacity 
for 
successful 
decentralization. 
Project 
Benefits 
The project 
is 
expected 
to yield 
several 
benefits. 
These 
include: 
improved 
health 
status 
in 
the 
four 
provinces through 
increased spending, 
better 
prioritization 
of 
health 
care needs 
and 
subsequent 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
preventive and 
primary level 
health 
services; 
provision 
of 
essential 
health 
services 
to 
the 
poor, 
improved 
allocational 
efficiency 
with 
reference 
to 
health 
workforce and financial 
inputs; 
improved 
technical 
efficiency 
through 
enhanced 
service 
quality 
and 
increased 
productivity 
through 
improved 
health. 
The 
Indonesian health 
strategy 
showed that even 
prior to 
the 
economic 
crisis 
of 
1997, 
the 
Government 
was 
spending 
approximately 
US$23,000 
per health 
center 
delivering 
18 
programs 
and 
activities. 
Using 
information 
on 
actual 
inputs 
for 
each 
program activity 
in 
a 
typical 
health 
center 
revealed 
that 
about 
25% 
of 
health 
expenditures 
could not 
be attributed 
to 
identifiable 
activities. 
The 
main 
source 
of 
the 
gap 
was 
staff time 
- 
only 
40% 
of 
the 
staff 
time could 
be 
accounted 
for. 
This 
implies 
that 
efficiency 
gains 
could 
be 
made 
through 
improved 
use 
of 
staff 
time. 
The project 
will 
yield 
significant institutional 
benefits through 
improved 
health 
work 
force 
planning 
and management, 
improved quality 
of 
health 
personnel through 
improved 
pre-service education 
programs, 
and 
quality 
in-service 
training 
at 
district 
level. 
It 
will 
also 
promote self-regulation 
of 
the 
nursing 
and 
midwifery 
professions. 
Through 
support 
to 
the Center 
for 
the 
Empowerment 
of 
Health 
Professions and 
International 
Workforce 
(Puspronakes) 
it 
will 
empower 
health 
professionals 
in 
general, 
and 
nurses 
and 
midwives 
in 
particular, 
by 
developing self-regulation 
and appropriate 
organizational 
arrangements 
to 
carry out certification, 
advocacy and 
regulation 
so 
as 
to 
strengthen 
accountability 
to 
the 
public 
and 
to 
the 
profession.

The 
main 
benefit 
of 
the 
project 
is 
that 
it 
will 
improve 
the 
health 
status 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
four 
provinces. 
It 
will 
also increase 
use 
of 
public facilities 
especially 
by 
the 
poor 
through 
targeted 
subsidies 
and 
improved quality 
of 
services. 
Thus, 
through 
its 
support 
of 
development 
of 
services 
to 
improve 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
(including 
safe 
motherhood, 
immunization, 
nutrition, 
etc.): 
organize 
epidemiological 
surveillance and 
disease 
outbreak 
response: 
control 
communicable 
diseases 
(including 
malaria 
and 
dengue, 
tuberculosis, 
STD/HIV, 
etc.); 
promote health 
information 
and 
education: 
and 
strengthen 
environmental health 
(including 
water and 
sanitation),  the 
project 
will 
result 
in 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
prevalence 
of 
risk 
factors 
related 
to 
childhood 
and 
maternal 
undernutrition 
(such 
as 
underweight, 
Vitamin 
A 
deficiency, 
zinc 
deficiency 
and 
iron 
deficiency) and environmental 
factors 
related 
to 
unsafe water, 
sanitation and 
hygiene, 
among 
the 
project 
population. 
At 
present, 
health 
status 
of 
the 
population 
in 
these 
provinces 
is 
low. 
West 
Sumatera 
has an 
infant mortality 
rate 
of 
49 
per 
thousand 
live 
births, 
a 
under-five 
mortality 
rate 
of 
66 
per 
thousand 
live 
births 
and 
maternal 
mortality 
ratio 
of 
328 
per hundred 
thousand 
live 
births. 
More 
than a quarter 
of 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
suffer 
from 
calorie-protein deficiency, 
20.5% 
suffer 
from 
goiter. 
In 
addition, 
57% 
of 
pregnant 
mother 
suffer 
from 
iron 
deficiency 
and 
10% 
of 
babies 
born 
are 
of 
low 
birth 
weight.  Poor 
access 
to 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
and 
poverty 
are 
among the 
main 
causes 
of 
the 
low 
health 
status. 
In 
2001, 
in 
Jambi, 
where 
the 
population 
density 
is 
relatively 
lower 
than West 
Sumatera, 
infant 
mortality 
rate 
in 
2001 
was 
33 
per 
thousand 
live 
births, 
while 
under 
five 
mortality 
rate 
was 
45 
per 
thousand 
live 
births. 
The maternal 
mortality ratio 
was 
220 
per hundred 
thousand 
live 
births 
and 
life 
expectancy 
at 
birth 
was 
67 
years. 
In 
West 
Kalimantan, 
the 
infant mortality 
rate 
is 
47 
per 
thousand 
live 
births. 
Almost 
a 
third 
of 
the 
children 
under 
five 
years 
of 
age 
are 
malnourished 
and 
more 
than 
half 
of 
pregnant 
mothers 
are 
anemic. 
Morbidity 
rate 
is 
also 
high 
- 
results 
of 
the 
2001 
SUSENAS 
show that 
22.2% 
of 
the 
people 
surveyed 
complained 
that they 
had 
at 
least one 
clinical 
symptom 
in 
the 
previous month. 
Geographical 
access 
to 
health 
facilities 
is 
poor 
for 
people 
residing 
in 
rural 
areas. 
This 
could 
explain 
why 
over 
60% 
of 
those 
who 
suffered 
from 
an 
illness 
treated 
themselves 
without visiting 
any 
health 
care 
facility. 
Although 
East 
Kalimantan 
is 
a 
high-income 
region 
and 
often 
linked 
with 
good health 
status, 
its 
infant mortality 
rate 
is 
33 
per 
thousand 
live 
births. 
There 
are, 
however, 
wide 
disparities 
in 
health 
status 
among 
urban and 
rural 
populations. 
These 
provinces 
also 
suffer 
from 
either a 
lack 
of 
adequate 
human 
resources 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
West 
Sumatera, 
or 
unequal 
distribution 
of 
human 
resources 
across 
hospital 
with 
many 
health 
centers 
without 
any 
doctors 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Jambi. 
The project 
is 
expected 
to 
improve 
the 
service 
quality 
through 
better 
training, 
coordination 
and 
management 
and 
improve 
the 
slull 
mix 
and 
distribution 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
the 
sector. 
Currently, 
in 
the 
four 
provinces 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
there 
is 
wide variation 
both within 
and 
across 
provinces 
in 
health 
spending 
per 
capita. 
Health 
spending 
per capita 
in 
year 
2002 
varies between 
Rp 
20,000 
and 
Rp 
72,000 
in 
W. 
Sumatera, 
Rp 
20,000 
and 
Rp 
39,000 
in 
Jambi, 
Rp 
23,000 
and 
Rp 
62.000 
in 
West 
Kalimantan 
and 
16,000 
and 
90,000 
in 
East 
Kalimantan. 
Thus, 
in 
order 
to 
make substantial 
impact 
on key 
health indicators 
substantial 
increase 
in 
health 
spending 
per capita 
would 
be 
required 
as 
is 
proposed under the 
project.

Summary 
of 
Benefits and 
Costs: 
The 
project 
will 
result 
in 
an 
annual increase 
of 
5% 
in 
healthy 
life 
years 
which 
would 
have 
otherwise 
been 
lost 
due 
to 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
caused 
by 
risk 
factors 
related 
to childhood 
and 
maternal undernutrition 
(such 
as 
underweight, 
Vitamin 
A 
deficiency, 
zinc 
deficiency 
and 
iron 
deficiency) 
and environmental 
factors 
related 
to 
unsafe water, 
sanitation and 
hygiene. 
Under 
these 
assumptions, 
the 
average 
annual healthy 
life 
years 
gained under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
10,152 
for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
14,950 
for 
West Kalimantan, 
9,198 
for 
Jambi 
and 
17,240 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
The per 
capita income 
of 
each 
province 
is 
used 
to 
obtain 
the monetary value 
of 
each 
healthy 
life 
gained 
- 
Rp 
26.7 
million 
for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
4.9 
million 
for 
West 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
3.6 
million 
for 
Jambi 
and 
Rp 
5.4 
million 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
The 
value 
of 
healthy 
life 
years 
gained 
in 
one year 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
Rp 
358.8 
billion 
for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
104.4 
billion 
for 
West 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
47.4 
billion 
for 
Jambi and 
Rp 
132.9 
billion 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
Project 
costs 
for 
improvements 
in 
service 
delivery 
in 
the 
district 
level 
through direct 
investments 
under the 
credit 
(not accounting 
for 
government 
funding 
for 
district 
health 
services 
which 
will 
have 
considerable 
costs 
and benefits) 
are 
Rp 
595.9 
billion. 
The benefit 
cost 
ratio 
for 
the 
project 
is 
16.9 
and 
the net 
present 
value 
of 
project 
benefits discounted 
at 
10% 
is 
Rp 
3,538 
billion 
with 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
of 
76.5%. 
Main 
Assumptions: 
Cost-Benefit analysis: 
While 
the 
project through 
improved 
management 
and 
delivery 
of 
services 
and 
bringing 
services 
closer 
to 
the 
population 
will 
have 
substantial 
impact 
on 
both 
health 
status 
and 
efficiency 
of 
service 
delivery, 
most 
of 
these 
impacts 
are 
difficult 
to 
quantify. 
In 
addition, 
improved 
skills 
of 
health 
personnel especially doctors 
through 
improvements 
in 
medical 
education 
will 
improve 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
but 
this 
impact 
will 
not 
manifest 
itself 
in 
the short term. 
The 
following 
analysis 
attempts 
to 
develop 
a conservative 
estimate 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
project 
benefits 
during 
the 
implementation 
period 
and 
ten 
years 
after 
project 
completion. 
It 
is 
expected that 
significant 
improvements 
in 
service 
delivery 
accompanied 
by 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
use 
of 
preventive 
and 
public 
health 
services 
by 
the 
poor 
will 
result 
in 
reduction 
of 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
among 
vulnerable populations 
such 
as 
the 
poor, 
women 
and 
children. 
Data 
from 
the 
2002 
World 
Health 
Report 
for 
countries 
in 
South-East 
Asia region 
is 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
benefit 
of 
reductions 
in 
risk 
factors 
related 
to 
childhood 
and 
maternal 
undernutrition 
(such 
as 
underweight, 
Vitamin 
A 
deficiency, 
zinc 
deficiency 
and 
iron 
deficiency) and environmental 
factors 
related 
to 
unsafe water, 
sanitation and 
hygiene. 
According 
to 
the 
WHR 
2002, 
almost 93 
DALYs 
are 
lost 
per thousand 
population 
due 
to 
these 
risk 
factors. 
It 
is 
assumed here 
that 
the 
project 
will 
result 
in 
an 
annual 
increase 
of 
5% 
in 
healthy 
life 
years 
which 
would 
have 
otherwise 
been 
lost 
due 
to 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
caused 
by 
these 
risk 
factors. 
Under 
these 
assumptions, the average 
annual 
healthy 
life 
years 
gained under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
10,152 
for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
14,950 
for 
West Kalimantan, 
9,198 
for 
Jambi 
and 
17,240 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
The 
per capita 
income 
of 
each 
province 
is 
used 
to 
obtain 
the 
monetary 
value 
of 
each 
healthy 
life 
gained 
- 
Rp 
26.7 
million 
for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
4.9 
million for 
West Kalimantan, 
Rp 
3.6 
million 
for 
Jambi and 
Rp 
5.4 
million 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
The 
value 
of 
healthy 
life 
years 
gained 
in 
one year 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
Rp 
358.8 
billion for 
East 
Kalimantan, 
Rp 
104.4 
billion 
for 
West Kalimantan, 
Rp 
47.4 
billion 
for 
Jambi and 
Rp 
132.9 
billion 
for 
West 
Sumatera. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that the 
gains 
in 
health 
will 
be 
negligible 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
the 
second, 
third, 
fourth 
and 
fifth 
years the 
project 
benefits 
will 
be 
lo%, 
30%, 
50% 
and 
75% 
respectively.

One hundred 
percent 
of 
project benefits 
will 
be realized 
from 
the 
sixth 
year 
onwards 
for 
another 
ten 
years. 
Based 
on 
these 
assumptions, the 
monetary 
value 
of 
project 
benefits after 
ten 
years 
after project 
completion 
will 
be 
Rp 
10,054.4 
billion. 
Project

funding 
for

health 
services 
which 
will 
have considerable

and benefits) 
are 
Rp 
595.9 
billion. 
The benefit

Several factors 
such 
as 
delay 
in

of 
project 
activities 
could 
lead 
to 
a delay 
in 
accruing project 
benefits and 
could

Currently, 
in 
the 
four 
provinces 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
there 
is 
wide variation 
both 
within 
and 
across 
provinces 
in 
health 
spending per 
capita. 
Health 
spending 
per 
capita 
in 
year 
2002 
varies 
between 
Rp 
20,000 
and 
Rp 
72,000 
in 
West 
Sumatera, 
Rp 
20,000 
and 
Rp 
39,000 
in 
Jambi, 
Rp 
23,000 
and 
Rp 
62,000 
in 
West 
Kalimantan, 
and 
Rp 
16,000 
and 
Rp 
90,000 
in 
East 
Kalimantan. 
In 
most 
districts however, health 
spending 
is 
low 
- 
in 
West 
Sumatera 
district 
health 
spending 
varies 
between 
5% 
and 
7% 
of 
district 
budgets, 
in 
Jambi 
it 
varies 
between 
3% 
and 
8%, 
in 
East 
Kalimantan 
between 
1% and 
4% 
and 
in 
West 
Kalimantan 
between 
5% 
and 10%. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
substantial 
impact 
on 
key 
health indicators however 
substantial 
increase 
in 
health 
spending 
per 
capita 
would 
be 
required. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
grants 
to 
districts 
and 
provinces 
on 
a need basis 
to 
support 
development spending 
to 
achieve increased 
health 
outcomes. 
This 
section 
attempts 
to 
discuss 
the amount 
of 
increased 
district 
health 
spending 
over 
the 
project 
period 
required 
to 
achieve 
these 
benefits and 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the increased spending 
should 
be financed through 
the 
credit. 
The 
expected 
health 
spending 
per capita 
for 
the 
four 
provinces 
was 
derived 
using 
average 
district 
health 
spending 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
district 
budgets 
for 
each 
province. 
Using 
current 
spending 
percentages 
of 
6% 
of 
district 
budgets 
for 
West 
Sumatera 
and 
Jambi, 
2% 
for 
East 
Kalimantan 
and 
8% for 
West Kalimantan, 
the estimated 
per capita health 
spending 
for 
2004 
and 
2009 were 
calculated 
(see 
Tables 
4.3 
a, 
b, 
c and 
d). 
The 
district 
budgets 
were estimated 
using 
2001 
figures 
from 
the 
Regional 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(draft, 
2002). 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
various components 
of 
the 
district 
budget 
namely 
the 
DAU 
and 
the shared revenues 
will 
grow 
at 
4% 
(estimated 
future 
GDP 
growth 
rate) 
per annum 
and 
that 
the 
local 
revenues, 
i.e., 
PAD 
will 
grow 
at 
6% 
per 
annum.

Note: 
These 
estimates are 
constructed using 
2002 
health spending levels and then estimating per capita 
health 
spending 
in 
2004 
based 
on 
current 
spending 
percentages 
of 
6 
percent 
of 
district 
budgets 
for 
West Sumatera 
and Jambi, 
2 
percent for East 
Kalimantan 
and 
8 
percent 
for 
West 
Kalimantan.  Assumption: 
the 
various 
components 
of 
the 
district 
budget namely the 
DAU 
and the 
shared revenues 
will 
grow 
at 
4 
percent 
(estimated future 
GDP growth 
rate) 
per 
annum 
and 
that 
the 
local 
revenues 
Le. 
PAD 
will 
grow 
at 
6 
percent per 
annum. 
The 
above 
figures 
indicate 
that 
per capita 
spending 
in 
health 
is 
low. 
To 
determine the 
adequate 
level 
and 
allocation 
patterns 
for 
per 
capita outlays 
several 
options 
were considered.  One 
option 
developed 
for 
the 
previous 
provincial 
health 
projects 
was 
to 
cost 
a 
package 
of 
18 
public 
health 
services 
provided 
at the 
health 
center 
level including 
some 
out-patient 
curative 
services 
for 
the 
poor 
estimated 
to 
account 
for 
20% 
of 
households 
(Table 
4.4). 
This 
very 
basic 
set 
of 
measures 
is 
estimated 
to 
cost 
Rp 
42,000 
per 
capita 
in 
year 
1999 prices 
to 
deliver. 
In 
2003 prices, the 
package 
costs 
approximately 
Rp 
5 
1,000. 
The 
package 
does 
not 
include 
in-patient 
care 
for 
the 
poor 
in 
hospital or 
environmental health 
interventions. 
In 
principle, 
the 
Rp 
51,000 
per 
person 
target can 
be 
reached 
through project-financed 
increases 
in 
development 
spending. 
However, 
the 
resulting 
investment 
would 
be 
large, 
e.g. 
roughly 
US$117.6 
million. 
If 
in-patient 
care 
for 
poor 
in 
hospitals and maintenance 
costs 
are 
added 
this 
number 
would 
be 
significantly 
higher. 
In 
addition, 
health 
spending 
would 
drastically 
fall 
at the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
period 
to 
pre-project 
levels 
of 
public 
health 
spending. 
To 
avoid 
a 
large 
project 
size 
and a 
sharp 
drop 
in 
spending 
in 
2009, 
government 
health 
spending 
would 
have 
to 
increase 
during 
project 
implementation 
period 
in 
order 
to 
sustain and deepen 
project 
benefits. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
has 
recommended that government 
health 
spending 
should be 
about 
15% 
of 
local 
government 
spending. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
all 
project 
districts 
will 
achieve 
this 
level 
of 
spending 
(except 
for 
East 
Kalimantan 
where current 
health 
spending 
is 
only 
2% 
of 
local 
government 
spending 
and 
an 
increase 
to 
8% 
of 
local 
government spending 
is 
assumed 
as 
it 
is 
more 
realistic 
than 
an 
increase 
to 
15% 
with 
a 
five 
year 
period) 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
period. 
If 
the 
project 
provides 
approximately 
50% 
of 
funds 
for 
development spending 
in 
the 
project 
districts 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
project 
and 
reduces 
this 
amount 
to 
zero 
percent 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
approximately 
US$82 
million 
would 
be 
required 
in 
project 
funds 
to 
meet 
increased outlays 
in 
health 
spending 
at 
the 
province 
and 
district 
levels 
during 
the 
project 
period. 
During 
the 
project 
period 
to 
ensure 
that 
project 
grant 
funds 
are 
not 
used 
for 
ongoing health recurrent 
budget requirements 
of 
the 
district, 
the 
total 
funds 
allocated 
to 
each 
district 
annually 
will 
be 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Joint 
Health 
Council, 
when 
approving 
the 
district 
grant 
allocation 
proposals. 
The 
proposals 
would 
clearly indicate 
of 
the 
use 
of 
project 
funds 
in 
each 
district 
and 
these 
will 
be monitored. 
-

Page  81
To 
sustain 
these 
levels 
of 
spending 
beyond 
the 
project 
period, government 
health 
spending 
of 
many 
districts 
would 
have 
to 
increase 
by 
40% 
than 
what 
would 
be 
the 
case 
if 
current 
percentages 
of 
local 
health 
spending 
to 
local 
government spending 
were 
maintained. 
One 
remedy 
might 
be 
to 
borrow 
additional 
amounts 
for 
a 
longer 
period, the 
feasibility 
of 
which 
would 
be 
dependent 
on 
the terms 
of 
the 
credit. 
The 
post-loan 
risk 
of 
a 
drop 
in 
spending 
unless 
the 
health 
share 
rose 
to 
15% 
or 
higher 
would 
still 
persist and 
this 
would 
further heighten 
inter-sector 
competition 
for 
funds. 
An 
alternative 
would 
be 
an 
intra-province solution 
using 
special 
health 
taxes 
to 
cross-subsidize 
between 
well 
off 
and 
poor 
areas. 
While 
this 
may 
be 
feasible 
in 
East 
Kalimantan, 
in 
others 
it 
could 
present 
political 
hurdles. 
Thus, 
in 
reality raising 
DAUs 
and 
to 
inject 
resources 
through 
other 
channels 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
the best 
alternative. 
The 
MOH 
would 
need 
to 
press the 
case 
for 
a 
linkage between 
DAUs 
and 
health conditions 
and 
service 
access. 
To 
help 
the 
MOH 
in 
achieving 
this, 
ensuring increased 
health 
funding 
at 
the 
district 
level 
(based 
on 
the 
formula 
of 
51,000 
per 
capita) 
will 
be 
a 
key 
condition 
and a 
key 
performance 
indicator 
of 
the 
project. 
These increases 
will 
be 
monitored 
annually through 
the development 
and 
insitutionalization 
of 
district 
health 
accounts 
in 
the 
project 
provinces. 
The 
experience 
of 
the 
previous 
two 
provincial 
health projects 
in 
reaching 
the 
goals 
of 
increasing 
district 
health 
allocation, 
will 
also 
be 
monitored 
closely 
and the 
projects 
targets 
will 
be 
adjusted 
based 
on 
the lessons 
learned 
from 
these 
projects.

reasons: 
(i) 
the 
main 
bulk 
of 
procurement 
activities 
will 
be 
in 
the 
target provinces, 
districts 
and the 
universities. 
However, 
there 
is 
limited 
experience 
in 
the 
provinces and 
no 
experience 
in 
the 
districts and 
universities 
with 
Bank 
financed 
projects; 
(ii) 
there 
are 
inconsistencies 
between Keppres 
18/2000 
and the 
Bank 
Guidelines; 
(iii) 
there 
are 
limited 
staff 
available 
with 
sufficient 
procurement 
capacity 
in 
general; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
general procurement 
environment 
is 
weak 
and 
collusive 
practices have been 
found 
in 
past 
projects. 
Sanctions 
for 
collusive 
practices 
are 
rarely 
enforced 
in 
any 
way 
that 
deters 
further 
collusion;

rated 
the 
proposed project's procurement 
risk 
as 
"high" 
for 
the 
following

- 
Page  86
and 
(v) the 
new 
decentralization 
laws 
and 
the 
rising 
power 
of 
districts 
will 
place 
added pressure 
on 
project 
staff 
to 
favor 
local 
firms 
and 
individuals 
even 
though 
these 
are 
expressly 
forbidden 
by

rules. 
6. 
The 
following 
actions 
to 
mitigate 
“high“ 
risk 
are 
included 
in 
the 
action 
plan: 
(a) 
Capacity 
enhancement 
by 
adding 
capacity 
-- 
Project 
Implementing 
Units, 
which 
include 
an 
Executive 
Secretariat 
at 
the Central, 
Provincial 
and 
Districts 
levels, 
will 
be 
established. 
This 
would 
include 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
qualified 
Procurement Specialist 
at 
the 
central 
level 
and appointment 
of 
procurement 
officers 
at 
the 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels; 
(b) 
Procurement 
Training 
-- 
A 
Procurement 
and 
Financial 
Management 
Training 
for 
Trainers 
was 
conducted 
on 
January 
13-16,2003 
for 
procurement and 
FM 
officers 
for 
the 
Central 
and 
Provincial 
Units. 
This 
training 
was 
arranged 
by 
MOH 
and 
the 
Bank 
provided 
staff 
as 
trainers. 
Follow-up 
training 
is 
planned 
to 
be 
conducted at 
the 
provincial level 
for 
the 
Districts 
tentatively 
in 
June 
- 
July 
2003. 
A 
Project 
Training 
Plan 
has 
been established 
which 
includes: 
(i) 
Annual 
Procurement 
TrainingNorkshop 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
4th 
quarter 
of 
each 
year, 
and 
(ii) 
Procurement 
training provided 
by 
Bank 
staff 
prior 
to 
effectiveness, 
and 
during 
supervision; 
and 
(c) 
Enhanced 
planning 
and 
controlling 
mechanisms 
-- 
The 
draft 
procurement 
plan

Financial Management 
and Disbursement 
A. 
Risk 
Analysis 
Below 
are 
the 
financial 
management 
risks, 
and 
how 
they 
will 
be 
addressed 
as 
per 
the 
lessons 
leamed 
from 
the 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
PHP-I: 
(i) 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
(PMM) 
and 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
Manual 
(DFAM) 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
project 
implementation, especially 
in 
anticipating 
potential 
problems. 
The 
PMM 
will 
include 
organizational 
structure, 
job 
description, budgeting, 
procurement, 
and guidelines 
for 
record 
keeping. 
Financial 
Management 
Report 
(FMR) 
will 
constitute the 
basis 
for 
disbursement, 
and 
will 
cover 
preparation 
and 
recording 
of 
financial 
statements, 
fixed 
assets 
management, 
intemal 
control, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation mechanism 
for 
the 
project 
management 
system, 
auditing 
arrangements 
and 
governance 
and disclosure requirement 
for 
the 
project. 
DFAM 
describes 
funding 
allocation, proposal 
preparation 
process, 
organization 
structure and 
job 
descriptions, 
flow 
of 
funds 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation, 
including 
the 
mechanism 
for interim 
audit. 
(ii) 
Since 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
are 
meant 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
all 
project coordination 
and implementation 
staff, 
training 
on 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
will 
also 
be carried 
out 
for 
proper 
project 
implementation. 
The 
training 
is 
expected 
to 
cover 
both 
procurement and 
financial 
management, 
including 
the preparation 
of 
FMR 
for 
the 
relevant CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff. 
(iii) 
The 
selection and 
proper 
compensation 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretary(ies), 
Project/Sub-Project 
Manager(s) 
and 
treasurer(s) 
are 
also 
critical 
for 
the 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
PMM 
and 
DFAM. 
(iv) Supervision 
of 
project 
implementation 
at 
the 
DIU 
level 
is 
equally 
important 
in 
instituting 
proper 
financial 
management practices. 
B. 
Strengths 
and 
Weaknesses 
Strengths 
The 
design and 
implementation 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
(organization 
structure, 
proposal 
preparation, 
flow 
of 
fund, 
accountability 
process) 
is 
familiar 
to 
MOH 
due 
to 
prior 
experience 
with 
Provincial 
Health 
Projects 
I 
and 
11, 
and 
ADB's 
Decentralized 
Health 
Services 
I 
Project. 
Especially 
for 
DGHE, 
MONE, 
the design 
of 
the 
project 
is 
also 
similar 
to 
three 
other 
Bank-funded 
projects, 
namely 
Global 
Development 
Learning 
Network 
Project, 
which 
has 
just 
been 
signed, 
Development of 
Undergraduate 
Education 
Project, 
which 
just

D. 
Flow 
of 
Funds 
The Project 
Manager 
at 
the 
central 
level 
and 
provincial 
levels 
shall 
be 
responsible 
for 
procurement 
and 
authorizations 
of 
expenditures 
under 
their 
components 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
agreed 
budgets 
under 
the 
existing 
government 
procedures. 
When 
expenditures 
are 
due 
for 
payment, 
they 
will 
submit 
payment 
requests 
to 
the 
relevant Treasury 
office 
(KPKN) 
who 
will 
issue 
payment remittance 
order (SPM) 
to 
Central 
Bank or 
commercial bank 
acceptable 
by 
the 
Bank 
to 
credit 
the payee’s accounts 
at 
the 
latter’s 
respective 
banks and 
to 
debit 
the 
project Special 
Account 
for 
the 
Bank’s 
portion. 
Immediately 
after 
credit 
effectiveness, 
DG 
Budget 
shall 
issue 
a 
circular 
letter 
to 
the 
relevant 
KPKN 
Offices 
providing 
guidelines and 
criteria 
for 
eligible project 
expenditures 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Credit 
Agreement. 
The 
channeling 
of 
fund 
to 
the 
districts 
under 
the 
District 
Funding 
Allocation 
(DFA), 
would 
be 
made 
through 
the 
Provincial’s 
budget 
mechanism 
which allow 
better supervision 
of 
project 
implementation 
and consistent 
with 
PHP 
I 
and 
II. 
Each 
district 
would 
prefinance 
expenditures 
in 
accordance 
with 
the agreed 
DFA 
which 
will 
then 
be 
accounted 
to 
the 
PCIU 
on 
monthly 
basis 
using 
FMR. 
Once 
verified, 
the 
PCIU 
will 
forward 
them 
to 
KPKN 
to 
reimburse 
DFAs 
expenditures 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
or directly 
from 
the 
Bank 
if 
practicable.

and 
PHOs 
have 
no 
experience 
with 
Bank 
financed 
projects. 
Moreover most 
of 
the proposed 
staff 
in 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
have 
not 
been 
trained 
and experienced 
in 
project 
management 
(including 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management). 
This 
limitation 
is 
proposed 
to 
be 
addressed 
by: 
(i) 
providing 
guidelines and 
criteria 
for 
the 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff; 
(ii) 
requiring 
all 
the 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff 
who 
are 
going 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
project 
to 
take 
government 
project 
management 
and 
treasurer 
(administration) 
training before 
the 
Loadcredit 
becomes 
effective; 
(iii) 
involvement 
of 
the proposed 
project 
management 
and 
executive 
secretariat 
a 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
(using 
PHP 
I 
and 
II 
as 
the 
basis); 
(iv) 
providing 
project 
management 
training 
for 
trainers 
including, 
procurement, 
internal 
control, 
record 
management, 
fixed 
assets 
management 
and 
reporting 
system 
based 
on 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM; 
and 
(v) 
ensuring annual 
training on 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
conducted 
for 
every 
staff 
involved 
in 
the 
project implementation. 
Role 
of 
the 
Project Manager 
at 
the 
central 
level 
is 
not 
significant 
since 
most 
of 
the 
management 
work 
will 
be 
handled 
by 
Executive 
Secretariat 
Team who 
will 
assist 
the 
Project 
Director. 
However, 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Project Manager 
in 
provinces and districts 
is 
crucial 
where 
most 
project activities 
are 
implemented. 
TORS 
for 
each 
member 
of 
the 
teams 
(including 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat) 
will 
draw 
on 
the 
definition 
of 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
set 
for 
PHP-I 
and PHP-II.

Accounting policies 
and 
procedures 
for 
this 
project 
will 
follow 
the 
government procedures 
Following 
are 
the 
main 
procedures. 
1. 
Budgeting; 
Project 
budget 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
the development budget. Preparation 
of 
the 
budget 
is 
initiated 
by 
an 
effort 
from 
the 
planning 
bureau under 
MOH 
at 
the 
central 
level. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
effort 
is 
to 
obtain early 
indication 
on 
the 
next 
year 
program. 
This 
effort 
starts 
in 
February through 
June 
with 
also 
putting 
into 
account the 
budget 
circular 
from 
DG 
Budget, and 
MOF 
containing 
guidelines 
to 
be 
used 
for 
costing operational 
expenses. 
The 
budget proposals 
are 
submitted 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
(DG) 
Budget 
in 
June 
of 
the year 
preceding 
the 
budget 
year. 
Following 
receipt 
of 
budget 
proposals, 
negotiations 
take 
place 
between 
the 
DG 
Budget 
and 
MOH 
on 
costing 
issues. 
DG 
Budget 
allocates 
budget ceilings 
in 
- 
94 
- 
Page  99
September. 
MOH 
then 
proceeds 
to 
prepare 
their 
budget 
in 
detail, 
CPCU 
specifically handling 
the project 
budget. 
The draft 
budget 
is 
then 
submitted 
to 
DG 
Budget 
and the 
Bappenas, 
and requires 
clearance 
from 
both 
agencies. 
DG 
Budget 
advises Bappenas 
on 
the 
total 
ceiling 
for 
the 
development budget. 
Following 
this, 
consultations 
take 
place 
between 
Bappenas 
and 
the 
MOH 
to 
finalize 
the 
development budget 
within 
this 
ceiling. 
The 
final 
budget 
for 
the 
project 
will 
then be ready 
for 
submission 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
as 
the 
Annual 
Work 
Plan 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
budget 
of 
the 
country 
is 
presented 
to 
the 
Cabinet 
in 
September 
and 
following 
Cabinet approval 
it 
is 
presented 
to 
Parliament. 
Budget 
monitoring 
systems 
within 
the 
project 
will 
be conducted 
by 
CPCU 
through 
FMR 
and 
the 
agreed 
supervision/training 
schedule. 
CPCU 
and 
PCIU 
will 
visit 
DIU 
periodically 
for 
monitoring 
purposes. 
This 
mechanism 
builds 
in 
the 
project 
for 
FMR 
confirmation 
and 
ensures 
that 
FMR 
is 
reliable 
for 
monitoring 
purposes. 
This 
mechanism 
also enables 
early 
indication on 
any 
problem, 
especially 
shortcomings 
in 
budget execution 
processes 
such 
as 
under-spending 
of 
budget 
allocations 
2. 
Expenditure 
process 
Activities 
Based 
on 
the assigned 
budget, CPCU, 
PCIU 
would 
be 
able 
to 
request 
for 
an 
advance 
(maximum 
of 
a 
month 
of 
projected 
cash need) 
from 
KPKN. 
This 
advance 
is 
maintained 
on 
an 
impress 
fund 
basis. 
The 
advance 
then 
would 
be 
able 
to 
be 
used 
by 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
for 
the 
project 
activities. 
The 
advance 
should 
be 
accountable 
to 
KPKN 
in 
a month, otherwise the amount available 
for 
next 
month 
advance 
will 
be 
reduced 
by 
KPKN. 
The 
accountability submitted 
to 
KPKN 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a payment 
request 
(SPP) 
after 
reviewed 
by 
the treasurer 
and 
project 
manager 
for 
its 
eligibility to 
the 
budget and 
sufficient 
supporting 
documentation. 
The 
SPP 
will 
be 
reviewed 
by 
KPKN 
(for 
its 
eligibility to 
the 
budget 
and 
documentation 
completeness) 
and 
followed 
by 
issuance 
of 
SPM 
(payment 
remittance 
orders) 
to 
the 
Central 
Bank or 
commercial 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank.  Central 
Bank 
or 
commercial 
bank then 
will 
transfer the 
fund 
to 
the 
CPCU’s 
bank 
account. 
Each 
SPP 
should 
at 
least 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
advance 
amount, 
otherwise 
the 
amount 
of 
the advance 
approved 
for 
the 
coming month 
will 
be 
reduced 
based 
on 
the 
project 
ability 
to 
absorb 
fund. 
In 
addition 
to 
that, excessive 
fund 
available should be 
return 
to 
KPKN. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year, 
the 
unused 
fund 
should be 
return 
to 
KPKN. 
Sumlier/Consultant 
Contracts 
Payment made 
for 
procurement 
and 
consultants 
selected 
is 
paid 
based 
on 
the payment 
arrangement 
on 
the contract 
with 
supplier 
and consultants. 
The 
payment 
transferred 
directly 
to 
the 
respected vendor 
or 
consultant. 
When 
CPCU 
or 
PCIU 
enter 
into 
a 
contract 
agreement, 
for 
payment, 
CPCU 
or 
PCIU 
prepare 
SPP 
to 
KPKN 
based 
on 
the payment 
arrangement 
on 
the contract. 
The 
SPM 
then 
will 
be 
issued 
by 
KPKN 
to 
the 
Central 
Bank 
or commercial 
Bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
payment 
transferred 
directly 
to 
the respected vendor 
or 
consultant. 
DIU 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
contract 
with 
Project Manager 
in 
province 
level 
for 
implementation 
of 
District 
Fund 
Allocation. 
Slightly 
different 
from 
the 
above, 
when 
DIU 
enters 
into 
a contract 
agreement, 
for 
payment, 
DIU 
makes the 
transfer 
directly to 
the respected 
vendor 
or 
consultant. 
The 
fund 
(maximum 
for 
four 
months 
activities) 
for 
the 
DIU 
activities 
(including 
contract) 
was 
available 
on 
DIU 
account. 
3. 
Record 
Keeping 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
will 
maintain 
a general 
cashbook, 
supported 
by 
a 
petty 
cash 
book, 
bank 
book, tax 
book 
and budget 
monitoring 
books 
for 
each 
Tolok 
Ukur 
and 
MAK 
(government 
chart 
of 
- 
95 
- 
Page  100
account). 
All 
cash 
transactions (cash basis) 
is 
recorded 
in 
the general cashbooks 
and 
it’s 
respected 
supporting 
books 
by 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
treasurers. 
All 
books 
are 
closed 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis 
and 
subject 
for review 
by 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
Project 
Manager. 
Reports 
on 
cash 
and 
bank 
monthly 
positions 
of 
the 
project 
to 
the 
project 
manager’s 
supervisor 
are 
compulsory 
for 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU. 
KPKN 
also 
maintains 
a 
budget 
realization 
records 
card 
specifically 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
card 
is 
supported 
by 
advance 
and contract 
monitoring 
cards (one cards 
for 
each 
contract). 
Funds 
for 
DIU 
based 
on District 
Fund 
Allocation 
are considered 
as 
a 
contract 
in 
KPKN 
level, therefore 
the 
card 
is 
exists 
for 
each 
DIU 
for 
monitoring. 
4. 
Reporting 
To 
enable 
budgeting 
and 
report preparation according 
to 
component and 
expenditure 
categories 
efficiently, 
harmonization 
between 
project 
component and expenditures category 
(as 
per 
Loadcredit 
agreement) 
with 
the 
GO1 
chart 
of 
accounts 
(Mata 
Anggaran Keluaran- 
MAK 
and 
Tolok 
Ukur) 
is 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
(PMM) 
to 
be 
issued 
by 
Secretary General, 
MOH. 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
will 
be 
required 
to 
record 
their 
expenditure 
and 
submit 
quarterly 
report. 
The 
quarterly report 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a basis 
for 
their contract 
disbursement. 
The 
quarterly 
report 
will 
indicate 
(i) 
sources 
and 
use 
of 
fund 
(ii) 
bank reconciliation 
and 
(iii) 
six 
months 
forecast 
of 
fund 
required. 
All 
reports 
received 
from 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
will 
be 
compiled 
by 
CPCU 
in 
an 
FMR 
format 
acceptable 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
submitted 
in 
quarterly 
basis 
to 
the 
Bank 
through 
MOF. 
The 
FMR 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a basis 
of 
disbursement. 
The 
quarterly report 
is 
accumulated 
annually 
for 
annual audit 
purposes. 
G. 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
(PMM) 
The 
PMM 
will 
document the system and 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff 
who involved 
in 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project 
has 
sound 
financial 
management 
practice. 
The 
PMM 
will 
include 
organization 
structure, 
job 
description, budgeting, procurement, guidelines 
for 
record 
keeping, 
FMR 
preparation 
and 
its 
use 
for 
the 
disbursement 
based, 
financial 
statements 
preparation, 
record 
and 
fixed 
assets 
management, 
internal 
control, 
monitoring 
and evaluation mechanism 
for 
the 
project 
management system, 
auditing 
arrangements 
and 
governance 
and disclosure requirements 
for 
the 
project. 
DFAM 
will 
document 
the 
description 
on 
the 
District 
Fund 
Allocation, 
organization 
structure and 
the 
job 
description 
specifically 
dealing 
with 
District 
Fund 
Allocation, 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
Proposal 
preparation 
process, 
Flow 
of 
Fund 
and 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation (including 
the 
mechanism 
for 
interim 
audit). 
An 
outline 
of 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
is 
plan 
to 
be 
discussed 
with 
the 
proposed 
CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
staff 
during 
the Procurement 
and 
Financial 
Management 
training 
in 
January 
2003. 
H. 
Internal 
and 
External 
Audit 
Internal 
Audit 
MOH 
and 
MONE 
have 
their owned internal audit 
unit 
(IG) 
who 
has 
a 
right 
to 
conduct 
an 
audit 
assignment 
to 
the 
project.  The 
IG 
mostly 
conducts 
operational 
audits 
to 
all 
units 
under 
MOH 
and 
MONE, 
including 
Loandcredits 
financed 
by 
donor 
agencies.

External 
Audit 
Interim 
Audit 
As 
part 
of 
the 
project 
control 
and 
monitoring, 
a 
requirement 
to 
have an 
interim 
audit 
for 
the 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
implementation 
is 
set 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
TOR 
for 
the 
assignment 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
the 
CPCU 
during 
the negotiations. 
The 
audit shall be 
conducted 
by 
auditor 
acceptable 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Annual 
Audit 
The 
proposed 
project 
audits 
will 
be 
based 
on 
annual 
project 
accounts 
to 
be 
prepared based 
on 
the 
quarterly 
FMRs. 
Auditors 
shall audit 
the CPCU, 
PCIU 
and 
DIU 
accounts, 
and 
will 
submit 
their 
reports 
to 
the 
Auditors’ 
head 
office 
for 
consolidation. 
CPCU 
shall 
prepare 
the 
consolidated 
project 
account 
including 
special account 
and SOE, based 
on 
FMR, 
for 
audit 
by 
the 
Auditors 
head 
office.  The 
annual 
audit 
reports 
shall 
be furnished 
to 
the 
Bank 
no 
later 
than 
six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
government 
fiscal 
year. 
The 
audit 
will 
be conducted 
in 
accordance 
with 
the Terms 
of 
Reference 
provided 
to 
the 
government and 
Audit 
Manual 
for 
World 
Bank 
financed project 
(EAP, 
July 
1998). 
The 
auditor 
will 
also 
audit 
the attainment 
of 
objectives 
according 
to 
the agreed 
performance 
indicators. 
In 
support 
to 
the 
transparency 
effort, the 
Bank would 
like 
to 
have 
an agreement 
with 
MOH 
and 
MONE 
on 
the 
mechanism 
for 
public 
(including 
media 
and 
NGO) 
access 
to 
the 
annual audit report 
of 
the 
project.  The mechanism 
has 
been 
agreed 
at 
negotiations. 
After 
the 
auditor 
issues 
the annual 
audit report, 
MOH 
and 
MONE will 
be 
required 
to 
provide 
public 
access 
read 
and comment 
on 
the 
audit report.

for 
the 
amount 
of 
the

the 
project 
implementation. 
J. 
Information 
Systems 
No 
computerized accounting 
system 
is 
available 
in 
the 
project 
level. 
The 
Project 
Management 
Reports 
will 
be prepared 
by 
the 
CPCU 
using 
Microsoft 
Excel, 
and 
the 
CPCU 
will 
provide 
the 
format to 
be 
used 
by 
both 
PCIU 
and 
DIU. 
The 
report 
will 
be 
sent 
in 
the 
form 
of 
diskette 
by 
post 
or 
with file 
when 
internet 
access 
is 
available 
to 
the 
CPCU. 
The 
CPCU 
will 
compile 
the 
report 
for 
submission 
to 
the 
Bank. 
K. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
In 
order 
to 
facilitate 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Loadcredit 
a 
Special 
Account 
denominated 
in 
US 
dollars 
will 
be 
opened 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
or 
commercial bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
under 
the name 
of 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Republic 
of 
Indonesia. 
The 
maximum ceiling 
of 
this 
account 
will 
be 
discussed 
with 
the 
Implementing 
Unit 
and 
MOF 
but 
will 
be proposed 
to 
be equivalent 
to 
about 
six 
months 
average 
disbursements 
in 
the 
peak 
period. 
The 
management 
of 
the 
Special 
Account 
would 
essentially 
be 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
CPCU. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank 
Loadcredit 
would 
be 
made 
to 
the 
Special 
Account 
based 
on 
the 
submission 
of 
the 
FMR 
prepared 
by 
the 
CPCU. 
All 
documentation 
for 
the 
expenditures 
as 
reported 
in 
the 
FMR 
would 
be 
retained 
at 
the 
relevant 
CPCU 
and 
shall 
be 
made 
available 
to 
auditors 
for 
the 
annual audit and 
to 
the 
Bank 
during 
the 
supervision 
missions. 
The 
Bank’s 
disbursement 
would 
be 
for 
the 
six 
months 
projected 
expenditures 
as 
reported 
in 
the 
FMR. 
L.

M. 
Supervision 
Plan 
This 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
supervised 
at 
least 
twice 
a 
year. 
Especially 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation, additional 
time 
will 
be 
needed 
for 
project 
supervision 
to 
ensure 
smooth 
implementation. 
The 
knowledge available 
in 
the 
Secretary General, 
MOH 
and 
Directorate 
of 
Higher 
Education, 
MONE 
from 
the 
previous 
projects 
is 
also expected 
to 
be utilized 
for 
supervision. 
The 
supervision 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
coordinated 
with 
the 
CPCU 
and 
PCIU 
own 
supervision 
and 
in 
conjunction 
with 
PHP-I 
and 
PHP-II. 
The 
supervision 
plan 
including 
its 
strategy 
(skdl 
mix, 
etc.) 
will 
be 
covered 
in 
the 
PMM.

Environmental Review 
INDONESIA: 
Health Workforce and Services 
Note: 
The 
Executive 
Summary 
of 
the 
Environmental Review 
is 
provided below.  The 
complete 
Environmental Review 
Report, 
including 
the 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
and Pesticide 
Management and 
Monitoring 
Plan, 
is 
located 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
1. 
This 
report 
documents the 
findings 
of 
an 
ER 
completed 
for 
the 
World 
Bank 
Indonesia 
Health 
Workforce 
and Services 
(HWS) project.  The 
ER 
complies 
with 
the 
Bank’s environmental 
review 
policies 
and 
procedures 
and 
environmental 
assessment 
guidelines 
(OP/BP/GP 
4.01 
and 
OP 
4.09). 
In 
addition, 
the 
ER 
references 
Indonesia’s 
environmental 
laws, 
regulations, 
policies 
and other 
relevant 
legislation 
to 
ensure 
that 
applicable environmental 
assessment 
and 
pollution control 
requirements 
are 
fully 
addressed 
in 
project 
implementation. 
2. 
The 
HWS 
project 
is 
classified 
as 
a Category 
B 
activity 
where 
more 
limited 
environmental 
analysis 
is 
considered appropriate 
to 
address 
specific environmental 
issues. 
Potential environmental and 
human health impacts 
of 
the 
project 
examined 
in 
completing 
the 
ER 
corresponded to: 
(a) 
planned 
construction 
and 
renovation 
of 
health 
care 
facilities 
(HCF) 
at 
the 
district 
level; 
(b) 
health 
care 
waste 
management 
(HCWM) 
practices; 
and 
(c) 
pesticide 
use 
in 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs. 
Environmental 
issues 
relevant 
to 
these 
project activities 
are 
detailed 
and recommendations 
made 
as 
to 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures 
and 
monitoring 
programs 
with 
a 
view 
to 
guiding 
project 
design and 
incorporating 
appropriate 
management plans 
during 
project 
implementation. 
3. 
Extensive consultation 
was 
sought 
with 
the 
MOH, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
(MOE), 
provincial 
and 
district 
health 
planning 
and 
environmental 
authorities, and 
HCF 
involved 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
health 
care 
in 
completing 
the 
ER 
to 
ensure 
that 
potential project 
impacts 
were 
fully 
understood and 
appropriate conclusions and recommendations 
were reached. 
Health 
Care 
Facility 
Civil 
Works 
4. 
district 
HCF 
in 
two 
of 
the 
four 
participating 
provinces 
confirmed 
that 
planned 
civil 
works 
do not 
pose 
any 
serious 
environmental 
concerns. 
It 
was 
determined 
that 
civil 
works 
will 
be 
limited 
to small 
hospitals 
(i.e., 
only 
two 
hospitals 
with 
less 
than 
200 
beds 
will 
be funded 
under 
the 
HWS 
project) 
and 
health 
centers 
and 
as 
such 
will 
not 
trigger 
full 
assessment 
under 
Indonesia’s environmental 
impact 
assessment 
(EIA), 
or 
AMDAL,, 
requirements. 
Notwithstanding, 
comprehensive 
environmental 
management/monitoring 
plans 
(UKLKJPL) 
shall 
be 
prepared 
for 
all 
new 
HCF 
construction 
and/or 
renovation 
of 
existing 
facilities, 
to 
ensure that any 
potential 
construction 
and 
operational 
phase 
environmental 
issues 
are 
identified 
and 
that appropriate 
mitigation 
measures are 
adopted 
to 
minimize or 
avoid 
adverse 
impacts. 
The 
UKL/UPL 
will 
encompass: 
(i) 
screening 
of 
proposed 
construction 
and 
renovation 
activities 
to 
evaluate the 
significance 
of 
potential 
environmental impacts; and 
(ii) 
identification 
and 
implementation 
of 
appropriate 
mitigation 
measures 
during 
civil 
works 
planning, 
design 
and 
construction.  Recommended 
minimum 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
be 
applied 
during 
renovation and 
construction activities include: 
strict 
adherence 
to 
occupational health 
and safety guidelines 
(e.g., 
international 
standards 
for 
removal 
and 
safe 
disposal 
of 
asbestos 
during 
renovations: 
prohibiting 
use

Activities 
undertaken 
to improve 
health 
services 
will 
inevitably 
create waste 
that 
is 
potentially 
hazardous. 
Health 
care 
wastes 
(HCW) 
are 
typically 
more 
hazardous 
than 
other types 
of 
wastes 
and 
should be 
considered 
in 
assessing 
planned 
HCF 
civil 
works.  Exposure 
to 
hazardous 
HCW 
can 
result 
in 
disease 
or 
injury 
to: 
medical 
doctors 
and 
nurses: 
auxiliary 
and 
maintenance 
staff; patients 
and visitors; 
and 
workers 
at 
landfills 
and 
other waste 
disposal 
facilities. 
To 
address these 
concerns, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
put 
in 
place 
safe 
and 
reliable 
methods 
for 
handling 
and proper 
disposal 
of

proper 
HCW 
handling, 
storage and 
transportation; and 
treatment 
of

methods. 
To 
ensure 
that 
best 
practices 
are 
promoted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
HWS 
project, 
specific 
recommendations 
are 
made 
to: 
Generally 
accepted 
HCWM 
strategies encompass: waste 
minimization, 
recycling, 
and 
reuse; 
0 
Adopt 
strict 
waste 
segregation 
practices 
at 
all 
HCF 
to 
ensure that 
wastes 
are 
properly 
separated, 
and 
that 
different 
waste 
streams are 
correctly 
treated 
and 
disposed 
of. 
Improve 
compliance 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
by 
HCF 
to 
demonstrate 
full 
adherence 
to 
applicable environmental 
regulations. 
Strengthen 
existing

available 
to 
HCF 
and 
ensure 
broad 
dissemination 
at 
the 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels.

construction 
and 
renovation 
activities 
as 
part 
of 
the 
HWS 
project. 
Although 
liquid 
waste 
from 
HCF 
is 
typically 
of 
a 
similar quality 
to 
urban 
wastewater 
it 
may 
also 
contain 
potentially 
hazardous components 
of 
concern 
from 
a 
human health 
perspective. 
Typically 
effluents 
discharged 
by HCF 
are 
greatly 
diluted 
and, 
as 
such, 
no 
significant 
health 
risks 
should be 
expected 
if 
pre-treated 
liquid 
waste 
is 
discharged 
to 
municipal 
sewer systems. 
Where 
connection 
to 
municipal 
systems 
is 
not 
feasible, 
then 
appropriate 
precautions 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
avoid health 
risks 
associated 
with 
discharge 
of 
untreated 
or 
inadequately 
treated 
sewage 
to 
the 
natural 
environment. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that, 
where 
possible, 
all 
HCF 
shall 
be 
connected 
to 
municipal 
systems 
and 
that 
pre-treatment 
of 
potentially 
hazardous waste 
streams 
(e.g., 
infectious 
wastes) 
be 
undertaken. 
Where 
there are 
no 
centralized 
sewage systems, 
proper 
on-site 
wastewater 
treatment 
systems 
shall 
be required. 
Wastewater 
from 
HCF 
represents 
a 
sub-category 
of 
HCW 
that 
must 
be 
addressed 
in 
planning 
8. 
Technical 
guidelines 
have 
already 
been 
developed 
by 
the 
MOH 
relating 
to 
the 
handling 
and 
disposal 
of 
solid 
and 
liquid 
HCW. 
Gap 
analysis 
completed 
on 
these 
guidelines 
found 
them 
to 
be 
comprehensive 
and 
representative 
of 
current 
best 
practices. 
Notwithstanding, 
recommendations 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
EMP 
with 
a 
view 
to 
assisting 
HCF 
in 
operationalizing available 
guidelines, 
including:

development 
of 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
covering

Malaria

Vector 
Control 
Programs 
9. 
have successfully 
passed 
(Le., 
interim 
or 
final 
specifications) 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization’s 
Pesticide 
Evaluation 
Scheme 
(WHOPES) and 
are 
considered 
to 
pose 
a 
very 
low 
risk 
if 
used 
correctly. 
Pesticides 
currently 
favored 
for 
malaria 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
programs 
in 
Indonesia 
have been 
selected 
primarily 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
relatively 
low 
toxicity 
to 
humans 
(i.e., 
Class 
II, 
or 
moderately 
hazardous, 
chemicals 
such 
as 
Bifenthrin, 
Bendiocarb, 
Lamda-cyhalothrin, Deltamethrin, 
and 
Permethrin and 
Class 
111 
and 
IV, 
or only 
slightly 
or 
non-hazardous, 
chemicals 
such 
as 
Etofenprox 
and 
Malathion) 
and 
comparative 
effectiveness. 
Although 
risks 
to 
humans 
from 
these 
pesticides 
are 
considered 
negligible, 
it 
is 
noted 
that 
proper 
precautions 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
safe 
handling 
and 
storage 
and 
to 
minimize 
exposure 
during 
actual 
use. 
All 
products 
intended 
for 
use 
in 
vector 
control 
programs 
to 
be 
funded 
under the 
HWS 
project 
10. 
and 
dengue 
vector 
control 
represents an 
important 
concern 
in 
program planning 
and implementation. 
Although 
their 
toxicity 
varies 
widely, 
chemical 
pesticides 
are 
typically highly toxic 
to 
non-target 
species, 
especially 
fish 
and 
aquatic invertebrates. 
Recognizing 
that 
the 
risk 
posed 
by 
pesticides 
is 
a 
product 
of 
toxicity 
and exposure 
(Le., 
there 
is 
little 
or 
no 
risk 
even 
at 
high 
pesticide 
concentrations 
if 
no 
exposure 
actually 
occurs), safeguard measures 
must 
be 
implemented 
to 
avoid 
the 
unintentional 
release 
of 
chemical 
pesticides 
through 
improper handling or 
disposal.

environmental 
toxicity, 
in 
contrast 
to 
their 
toxicity

humans, 
of 
pesticides

in 
malaria

Recognizing 
that 
all 
pesticides 
are 
toxic 
to 
some degree, 
it 
is 
paramount 
to 
ensure 
that 
proper 
care 
and 
handling 
practices 
form 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
any 
program 
involving 
their 
use. 
Gap analysis 
of 
existing 
MOH 
guidelines 
and 
review 
of 
ongoing 
malaria 
and vector 
control 
programs 
in 
Indonesia 
confirmed 
that 
occupational 
and 
environmental health 
safeguards 
are 
comprehensive 
and 
provide 
assurances 
that 
best management 
practices 
are 
being followed 
in 
program 
implementation. 
For 
this 
reason, 
recommended 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
primarily 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that 
safeguards 
already 
in 
place 
are 
fully 
adhered 
to 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
future 
vector

programs 
funded 
under 
the 
HWS 
project. 
Recommended 
enhancements 
to 
existing 
guidelines 
and 
practices 
specified 
in 
the 
PMMP 
encompass: 
(i) 
review 
and 
strengthening, 
as 
appropriate, 
of

(MONE) 
to 
redefine their roles 
and

in 
a decentralized setting 
in 
order 
to 
improve

and 
use 
of

and 
to 
enhance 
quality 
of

The primary goal 
of 
the

is 
to 
assist selected

(ii) 
sustained 
and 
expanded

Isolated Vulnerable 
Peoples, 
or 
IVP, 
are 
individuals 
and communities 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
indigenous people 
that 
share 
similar 
characteristics 
such 
as 
being 
outside 
the 
mainstream 
of 
political 
and economic power, physical isolation, 
language 
and 
cultural 
barriers, 
or 
part 
of 
an 
ethnic 
minority. 
There 
are 
communities 
of 
IVP 
in 
each 
of 
the 
target 
provinces 
with 
specific 
needs 
and 
issues 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
delivery 
of 
health 
services. 
Typically 
they 
are 
among 
the 
poorest 
communities 
in 
each 
of 
the 
provinces 
and 
by 
targeting 
the 
welfare 
of 
IVP 
the 
project 
is

Lack 
of

to 
health 
services, 
inequitable 
distribution 
of 
health 
care subsidies, 
and 
under-utilization 
of 
public

As

this 
is 
compounded

research 
was 
the 
cost 
associated 
with 
accessing 
government 
health 
services.  Services 
that 
are 
supposedly 
offered 
for 
free 
to 
the 
poor 
are 
often 
subject 
to 
“informal” 
fees 
and 
charges, 
both 
for 
service 
and 
for 
medicine. 
A 
common 
issue 
voiced 
by 
most 
of 
the 
NGOs 
and 
community 
members 
consulted 
during 
this 
11. 
Remote 
communities 
have 
difficulties 
in 
recruiting 
and 
retaining 
health 
care 
workers such 
as 
midwives 
(bidan), 
often 
the 
only 
source 
of 
modem 
health 
care 
in 
isolated 
villages. 
Many 
government-trained 
midwives 
are 
reluctant 
to 
remain 
in 
isolated 
areas 
without 
family 
or 
other 
social 
connections, and 
receive 
inadequate 
compensation 
for 
remote postings. 
Quality 
of 
Health 
Services 
12. 
Many 
of 
the stakeholders 
consulted 
during 
this 
assignment 
reported 
a 
lack 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
care 
provided 
by 
the 
public 
health 
care system. 
Many 
indicated 
a preference 
for 
traditional 
methods 
(e.g. 
herbal 
remedies, 
spiritual 
ceremonies) 
over 
those 
offered 
by 
modern 
health 
care services. 
13. 
include 
a 
lack 
of 
staff, 
absence 
of 
supplies and medicine, and 
ineffective 
treatment. 
Anecdotal 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
often 
health 
center 
staff 
members 
are 
engaged 
in 
some 
form 
of 
private 
practice 
and 
place 
a 
low 
priority 
on 
providing 
health 
care 
to 
the 
poor. 
Typically 
the 
concerns 
about 
quality 
of 
public 
health 
service focused 
on 
health 
centers.  Issues 
14. 
remains 
widespread. 
The 
rationale 
can 
be 
summarized thus: 
Traditional 
methods 
are 
at 
least 
as 
effective, 
cost 
less, 
and 
are 
more 
familiar 
than government 
services, 
so 
why 
abandon 
them? 
In 
fact, one 
respondent 
during 
the 
Social Review 
made 
the 
comment 
that even 
if 
there 
were 
a 
health 
center 
nearby, a 
traditional 
healer 
would 
be 
her 
family’s 
first 
choice 
for

by

Often 
government 
health 
care 
workers 
frown 
upon 
the 
use 
of 
traditional 
methods 
and 
its 
effectiveness 
is 
dismissed. 
Showing 
disrespect 
for 
what 
are 
perceived 
to 
be 
trusted 
methods 
undermines 
the 
community’s 
receptiveness 
to 
modern 
medicine, 
decreases 
the demand 
for 
government 
health 
services, and 
inhibits 
working 
with 
communities 
in 
areas 
of

medicine. 
Contributing to 
the 
lack 
of

The

to 
identify 
and 
monitor 
the

of

Approaches 
to 
developing 
this 
capacity 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
Surveys 
on

measures 
are 
incorporated 
into 
proposals that 
involve 
stakeholders 
in 
project 
design and

Through 
the 
network 
of 
key 
stakeholders 
identified 
in 
the social 
assessment, 
NP 
can 
be 
engaged 
in 
the 
development 
of 
project 
proposals

in 
the 
design 
of 
specific 
measures 
to 
address 
their 
health 
issues. 
In 
particular, 
it 
is 
expected that 
NGOs 
and 
other stakeholder groups 
will 
participate 
on 
District 
Health 
Councils, Joint 
Health 
Councils, 
and 
provide 
input 
to 
Technical Review 
Teams. 
In 
order 
to 
capitalize on 
the 
opportunities 
afforded 
by 
decentralization, the 
project 
will 
ensure 
20. 
The role 
of 
traditional 
health providers 
in 
planning 
health 
care 
will 
be 
evaluated 
and specific 
mechanisms 
for 
their 
inclusion 
will 
be 
developed. 
This 
might 
take 
the 
form 
of 
consulting traditional 
healers 
through 
NGOs, 
or 
designing capacity 
building 
for 
traditional 
healers 
to 
integrate 
them 
with 
the 
public 
health 
system. 
21. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
enhance the 
participation 
of 
client 
groups and other 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
planning 
of 
health 
services. 
Setting 
priorities 
based 
on 
local 
needs 
and designing 
a 
scope 
and 
range 
of 
services 
appropriate 
to 
these 
priorities 
will 
increase 
the 
efficiency 
of 
health 
service 
delivery 
and 
improve 
health 
outcomes. 
22. 
Opportunities 
for 
training 
stakeholders 
in 
participatory 
planning 
should be 
sought, 
as 
this 
will 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
bottom-up 
planning. 
This 
can 
include 
training 
in 
facilitation 
slulls 
for 
local 
NGOs 
or 
training 
in

monitoring 
and

Notification and 
Monitoring 
23. 
As 
activities 
are 
implemented 
in 
the 
districts, 
it 
will 
be 
important to provide 
public notification 
about 
the 
project, 
its 
objectives, 
and 
expected 
benefits. 
In 
this 
way 
local 
communities 
can 
better 
access 
the 
benefits 
of 
a 
proposed project 
as 
well 
as 
monitor 
the expenditures 
of 
project 
funds. 
Communities 
and 
community 
groups 
should be 
provided 
with 
an 
opportunity 
to 
provide 
feedback 
directly 
to 
the 
bank 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
project 
implementation. 
In 
this 
way 
communities 
can 
participate more 
directly 
in 
project 
monitoring 
and 
transparency 
will 
be 
enhanced.

is 
disseminated 
to

and 
to

on 
a

basis. 
Community 
involvement 
is 
being 
promoted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
sectors, 
particularly 
the

sector, 
and

It 
is

that 
by 
recruiting local 
people 
there 
will 
be 
improved 
long-term

Among 
the options 
to

designed 
in 
a 
way

in 
the

Anti-Corruption 
Action Plan 
INDONESIA: 
Health Workforce 
and 
Services 
Executive 
Summary 
1. 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
developing 
an 
anti-corruption action 
plan 
as 
part 
of 
project 
preparation 
to 
reduce 
fiduciary 
risks. 
The 
anti-corruption 
plan 
for 
Health 
Workforce 
and 
Services 
(HWS) 
Project 
was 
established 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
recently 
issued 
trial 
version 
of 
“Anti-corruption 
Guide: 
Developing 
and 
Anti-corruption Program 
for 
Reducing 
Fiduciary 
Rsks 
for 
New 
Project”, 
dated 
February 
14, 
2003, 
through 
joint 
discussions 
between the 
project 
preparation team 
of 
the 
Borrower 
and 
the 
Bank. 
The 
anti-corruption action 
plan 
for 
HWS 
is 
the 
first 
without 
any precedent 
for 
a 
Health 
sector 
project. 
Following 
the 
guidelines, the adopted 
approach 
was 
through 
the 
identification 
of 
elements 
or 
building 
blocks drawn 
from 
the 
design 
features 
and 
fiduciary 
arrangements 
of 
the project, 
from 
which 
the 
anti-corruption action 
plan 
can 
be 
constructed. 
Cases 
of 
fraud 
and 
corruption 
discovered 
recently 
in 
various 
Bank-financed 
projects, 
have 
2. 
provinces 
of 
Jambi, 
West 
Sumatera, 
West 
and 
East 
Kalimantan, 
comprising 
forty-seven 
districts 
(kabupaten) and 
cities 
(kota). 
This 
project 
intends 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
in 
selected 
provinces 
through 
institutional 
support, 
and 
increased 
investment 
in 
health 
financing 
and 
human 
resources. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
will 
build 
on 
the 
Provincial 
Health 
Project 
(PHP) 
I 
and 
11 
currently underway 
in 
other provinces 
(PHP 
has 
a 
human 
resource 
development 
sub-component). 
One 
particular 
feature 
of 
this 
project 
is 
the 
bottom 
up 
beneficiary 
sub 
project activities 
at 
the 
district 
level 
(Component 
A) 
which 
will 
be funded through 
the 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
(DFA). 
The 
main 
goal 
of 
the 
HWS 
is 
to 
support 
the process 
of 
health 
sector 
decentralization 
in 
four 
3. 
(PMM) 
and 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
Manual 
(DFAM) 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
project 
implementation. 
The 
PMM 
and 
DFAM 
provide 
a 
description 
on 
the systems 
and 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Central 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(CPCU), 
Provincial 
Coordination 
and 
Implementation 
Unit 
(PCN) 
and the 
District 
Implementation 
Unit 
(DIU), 
who 
will 
manage 
and 
implement 
the 
project 
activities 
to 
ensure 
that sound 
financial 
management 
practices 
are 
implemented. 
The 
PMM 
describes 
the 
organizational 
structure 
and 
functions 
and 
the 
guidelines 
for 
budgeting, 
procurement, 
record 
keeping 
and 
reporting 
using 
the 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Report 
(FMR) 
which 
constitutes 
the basis 
for 
disbursement. 
The 
PMM 
also 
covers 
preparation 
and 
recording 
of 
financial 
statements, 
fixed 
assets 
management, 
internal 
control, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation mechanism 
for 
the 
project 
management system, 
auditing 
arrangements, governance 
and disclosure requirements 
for 
the 
project.  The 
DFAM 
provides 
details 
on 
the 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
proceedings, 
the relevant 
organization 
structure 
and their functions, 
the 
guidelines 
for 
the 
District 
Fund 
Allocation 
Proposal 
preparation 
process, 
proposal outline, 
flow 
of 
fund, 
and 
its 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(including 
the 
mechanism 
for interim 
audit). 
The 
above 
documents 
reflected 
the 
agreements 
reached at 
negotiations 
and recorded 
in 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement and 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Given 
the 
decentralized and 
bottom 
up 
nature 
of 
this 
project, 
the 
Project 
Management 
Manual 
4. 
HWS, 
a 
Corruption 
Mapping 
Matrix 
was 
prepared 
and 
is 
located 
in 
the 
project 
file.  The matrix 
identifies 
project 
activities 
considered 
as 
having 
high 
corruption 
risks. 
These 
activities 
can 
be 
grouped 
into 
the 
various 
steps 
of 
procurement 
process, 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
DFA 
proposal and 
its 
budgeting, 
the 
appointment 
process 
of 
the 
project 
manager 
and 
treasurer, 
withdrawal 
process 
of 
advance payments, 
and 
project 
implementation.

were 
expanded 
to 
anti-corruption 
measures 
as 
provided 
in 
the 
following 
paragraphs. 
These 
measures 
address 
the 
five key 
elements 
of 
the anti-corruption 
action 
plan 
which 
are: 
i) 
Empowerment 
of 
Recipients, 
ii) 
Building 
of 
partnership 
for 
civil 
society oversight 
and 
feedback, 
iii) 
Establishment 
of 
procurement 
policies 
to 
mitigate collusion, 
iv) 
Building 
of 
strong 
task 
team 
with 
effective 
tools 
to 
pay 
increased 
attention 
to 
fiduciary 
risks, 
and 
v) 
Clear 
definition 
of 
remedies 
to 
anticipate deviations. 
The 
details 
of 
this 
action 
plan 
will 
be 
expanded 
in 
the 
PMM 
and 
DFAM. 
By 
analyzing the 
incentives 
and 
disincentives, 
mitigation 
measures 
were 
defined, 
which 
in 
turn 
No.
