CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY
AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
1.01     Egypt has an area of about one million km2 and except for the
delta area and the coastal strip along the Mediterranean coast is practi-
cally rainless. It is the cradle of one of the world's oldest civiliza-
tions, some of the remains of which are still perfectly preserved in
Egypt's arid climate.  These are viewed annually by hundreds of thousands
of visitors. In rural Egypt the tempo of life today seems unchanged
through the centuries but in the large cities the symptoms of modern life
are typically, traffic congestion, noise, pollution, uncollected garbage,
slum housing and overcrowding. The Government is now beginning to tackle
the problems of the cities by promoting and encouraging population
redistribution to strategically planned new towns. Associated with this
policy is an effort to try and stem the drift from the rural to the urban
areas by improving living conditions for the rural population.
1.02     Based on the 1976 census carried out by the Central Agency for
Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), it is estimated that the
present population of Egypt exceeds 40 million; at expected rates of
growth, it will reach 53 million by 1990 and nearly 68 million by year
2000. About 14 million of the total population is concentrated in the
cities of Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez Canal Zone, while about 18 million
(45% of the total population) is located in the fertile Delta Region north
of Cairo. Most of the country's production and economic activity is
centered around the major and secondary cities. However, at the heart of
Egypt's economy is its rich agricultural heritage, nurtured by irrigation
from the Nile River and sustained by innumerable farming families living in
small villages and settlements.
1.03     Administratively the country is divided into 26 governorates with
the largest concentrations of populations in the six urban governorates of
Cairo, Giza, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and Ismailia. In 1977 eight
economic planning regions were created each comprising a number of
governorates presided over by High Committees for Regional Planning in each
region; the committees consist of governors from the regions, representa-
tives of various ministries and the head of a Regional Planning Authority,
locally based, which is part of the Ministry of Planning. The planning
regions are not an intermediate tier of Government but are a means of
promoting cooperation and coordination of development between governor-
ates. Meanwhile, a Local Government Act 43/1979 has extended the powers of
governorates and increased their budgetary powers and financial resources
allowing each governorate to prepare its own economic plan with agreed
available resources. Governors hold the rank of minister and account
directly to the President.

Water Resources and Sewerage
1.04     Egypt depends on the Nile River as its primary source of potable
water. In conjunction with available groundwater, this source is ample to
supply all the country's needs for the foreseeable future. A recently com-
pleted UNDP financed Water Master Plan Study, for which the Bank was exe-
cuting agency, confirmed that public water supplies will absorb no more
than 5% to 6% of the total available resources.
1.05     Egypt's water supplies, outside Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez
Canal cities fall into three broad categories: (i) the eleven regional
systems built and operated by the General Organization for Potable Water
(GOPW) in the provinces which serve numerous towns, villages and rural com-
munities, mainly in the delta area; (ii) about 115 systems in the larger
provincial towns operated by municipalities; and (iii) borehole or well
systems operated by Government housing directorates serving smaller com-
munities outside the service areas of the GOPW or the municipalities.
1.06     Cairo and Alexandria are served by separate water supply authori-
ties while the Canal cities of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez are indepen-
dently supplied by systems developed and operated by the Suez Canal
Authority. In general, these large authorities, serving compact concentra-
tions of population, have been in a better position to plan and provide
water service more efficiently, and at lower cost, than the agencies
responsible for serving the secondary towns and villages in the provinces
where some 70% of Egypt's total population lives. Another feature which
distinguishes the supply authorities in Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez
Canal cities from the provincial supply authorities, has been their origins
as commercial operations and generally higher level of cost recovery, for
water delivered to customers; nationalization in the 1960's, created prob-
lems from which the industry is now beginning to recover.
1.07     In the provinces the supply systems operated by municipalities and
GOPW account for nearly 60% of production. The municipalities also collect
the greatest share of the revenues from such operations from consumers on
private connections, while most of the rural supplies are provided free at
public standpipes, from the GOPW regional schemes. In general GOPW and the
municipalities recover only about one third of their operating costs. Such
revenues, as are collected by GOPW local offices, revert to a central
account. Government in turn provides for all GOPW operating expenses,
including deficits, and its capital investment program.
1.08     Throughout Egypt there are some 17 existing municipal sewerage
systems, the largest in Cairo and Alexandria, and 13 being planned or under
construction. In addition, groundwater lowering schemes have been con-
structed in the 12 Delta towns, where the water table is high, with the
dual purpose of drainage and wastewater collection; these systems are now
overloaded and the practice is being discontinued by General Organization
for Sewerage and Sanitary Drainage (GOSSD) designers in favor of conven-
tional foul drainage methods which exclude groundwater.



1.09     With the major cities included it is estimated about 17 million of
the total population is urban, of which 70% have access to a public waste-
water disposal system or else use septic tanks or soakaways. The remainder
of urban population rely on dry sanitation disposal methods and mostly
represent water supply consumers using standpipe supplies.
Constraints to Sector Development
1.10     The major cities, in recent years, have been able to attract a
substantial amount of external financing for the expansion of their water
supply and sewerage facilities and have been the subject of extensive con-
sultant studies; USAID, in particular, has funded comprehensive water
supply and sewerage studies in Alexandria and the Suez Canal cities and is
preparing to provide finance to fund major investments in these cities.
1.11     Major improvements proposed for the Cairo sewerage system will be
assisted by joint funding from USAID and the UK Overseas Development Agency
(ODA). Under Loan 1369 the Bank is helping the Alexandria Water Authority
with a major expansion of its water supply facilities. In contrast, the
needs of the secondary cities and the rural areas of the provinces received
little attention until the 1977 WHO/IBRD Sector Report was prepared. This
report highlighted the problems and deficiencies in water supply and sewer-
age service in the provincial areas and helped provide the impetus for a
consultant's study of these needs. This study was executed by means of an
IDA engineering technical assistance Credit; Credit S-20 EGT approved
December 1977, was utilized and fully expended for this purpose. This
Credit is being re-financed under the proposed Credit.
1.12     The principal objectives of the study were to (i) study regional
water supply priorities; (ii) review the existing organizational arrange-
ments and recommend improvements; and (iii) prepare a water supply project
suitable for external financial assistance in the Delta Region. The find-
ings and recommendations, which ensued, were presented to the Government in
December 1979 and after discussions finalized in early 1980.
1.13     The problems in the water supply sector which the engineering and
technical assistance sought to address can be summarized thus: (a) frag-
mentation of responsibility for operations; (b) poor maintenance and opera-
tion of existing facilities; (c) excessive water losses; (d) inadequate
investment levels; (e) shortage of skilled staff; and (f) low tariffs and
poor cost recovery. The Government was already conscious of many of these
problems and in 1977 began to hand over operational responsibility of the
urban systems to the municipalities as part of a general policy of
decentralization. This transfer was not, however, accompanied by the
provision of the necessary resource support and created new problems as
local authorities were themselves short of qualified managers and staff to
operate the systems taken over. As a result, the GOPW has continued to
provide technical advice to municipalities on their operations and is still
responsible for design and implementing expansions of town facilities even
though its primary duty is to the systems for which it is directly
responsible.

Government Priorities in the Sector
1.14     The sector overview, which the study provided, confirmed the needs
and quantified in some detail the generally unsatisfactory and worsening
situation of public water supplies. To meet target needs in the year 2000,
when Egypt's population will reach about 68 million, requires investments
estimated at LE 1.7 billion or nearly US$2.5 billion, at 1979 prices. As a
start on this program, Government has decided, for the 1980-1990 water
decade, to budget LE 500 million for improving water supply service of
which more than half would be allocated to complete ongoing works and carry
out rehabilitation, in the expectation that matching funds could be
provided by outside lending agencies.
1.15     Governorate priorities were established using a matrix of informa-
tion on overall shortages, alternative sources of supply, poor service and
the condition of existing systems. The Delta Governorates of Beheira and
Kafr el Sheikh, with a combined population of some 4.3 million, were ranked
among eight commanding the highest priority; another six were ranked medium
priority and five others of low priority.
1.16     In addition to a capital works program, the studies identified the
need for a 10 year rehabilitation program estimated at LE 183 million which
would repair and renew source works and distribution in the rural and urban
communities of all other provinces; out of this an amount of LE 25 million
is required for works of the greatest urgency. The need for a national
rehabilitation program was discussed with the Government during negotia-
tions and agreement was reached that the GOPW's Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) will prepare, by December 31, 1982, a detailed program of urgent
rehabilitation work for review with IDA.
Sector Organization
1.17     The GOPW, with primary responsibility for the sector, was formed
by Presidential Decree in 1968 with the broad objectives of planning,
designing, building and operating potable water supplies throughout Egypt
with the exception of the major cities; its Chairman reports to the
Minister of Housing, Reconstruction and Land Reclamation. The GOPW Cairo
headquarters staff number about 760; another 3,100 employees are field
based in its operating regions.  Increasingly, GOPW has been unable to
adequately meet service demands from a growing population for a number of
reasons, among which are: (i) shortage of trained staff for the task in
hand and difficulty in engaging qualified personnel because job incentives
are poor; (ii) overcentralization of its operation; (iii) ineffective
responsibility for operations at local level; (iv) no operating or
financial objectives; (v) inadequate and late funding for expanding
facilities; and (vi) failure to maintain essential equipment and little
effort to reduce excessive water losses in the distribution; up to 50% of
production is unaccounted for in some systems. It is against this
background that the Government has decided to accelerate its
decentralization program for all provincial water supply systems with
responsibility for maintenance and operations in local hands.

1.18     The organizational weaknesses of the sector were thoroughly
explored in the studies referred to (para. 1.12) and in an earlier USAID
financed "Management and Tariff Study" covering the large cities. The
options looked into included compatible administrative boundaries, relation
to other sectors and the possibilities for rationalizing manpower and
resources. The recommendation to form separate provincial water supply
entities, which emerged, with full responsibility for delivery of service,
is in line with Government policies aimed at effective local control. The
powers of Governors are now being specified more clearly, through supple-
mentary legislation, to meet this objective. A central planning and
coordinating body is still recognized as necessary to help governorates
design and build major facilities.
1.19     While the organizational arrangements for the water supply sector
were being reviewed, parallel proposals were emerging for the GOSSD. The
GOSSD operates under the same framework as the GOPW in wastewater collec-
tion and disposal, but with at least one essential difference; it collects
no revenues for the services it provides and recovers all of its operating
costs from the Government. Thus, the recent decision to hive off the
cities of Cairo (10 million population) and Alexandria (2.6 million popula-
tion) from GOSSD and create separate local entities for sewerage also
called for a reassessment of its role. The municipal sewerage systems were
already being operated by provincial municipalities although the GOSSD con-
tinues to design and build systems on their behalf. Associated with water
supply improvements, it is estimated that wastewater disposal in urban pro-
vincial Egypt, to the year 2000, will cost between LE 935 million and
LE 1,024 million at 1979 prices.
1.20     With the functions of the GOPW and GOSSD being rapidly reshaped
through these organizational changes, the Government has decided to create
a National Water and Sewerage Authority (NWSA) with the same basic objec-
tives planned for a national water authority proposed earlier by the
consultants under the Credit financed studies. The benefits of dealing
with water supply and the resulting wastewater in a planned cycle by a
single coordinating authority are well recognized. A draft Presidential
Decree to merge the GOPW and GOSSD into the NWSA has been prepared by the
Minister of Housing, Reconstruction and Land Reclamation (MHR), and is
currently being processed. An adequate transitional period will be
necessary as these changes are put into effect. Since GOPW and GOSSD are
handing over their day-to-day operations to the regions, so responsibility
for these services would pass to the respective governors (Annex 3
illustrates the sector organization).
Performance in Previous Bank Loans
1.21     The Bank's first water operation in Egypt with the Alexandria
Water General Authority (AWGA), is ongoing; Loan 1369 helped the Bank
become familiar with the problems and opportunities in the sector. All
contracts have been awarded and progress is generally satisfactory. The
Alexandria Project has had some effect in raising the efficiency of the
AWGA but, as a general authority, it has been constrained in meeting all
its objectives, particularly its financial goals which are dependent on



approval of tariff increases by the local authorities. An action on a
general tariff increase, supported by the Governor and the Alexandria Local
Council was approved on April 18, 1981 with the intention of enabling the
AWGA to meet its commitments under the loan agreement.
1.22     The Engineering Technical Assistance Credit s-20 (paras. 1.11 and
1.12) was instrumental in preparing the present project. The consultants
were recruited with only a slight delay and executed their work within the
originally agreed timetable, thus ensuring prompt disbursement of the
Credit. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1980.
IDA's Objectives for the Sector
1.23     A major objective of the project is to help Government effectively
decentralize the water supply sector. It will demonstrate the benefits of
good management and provide lessons that can, hopefully, be applied in a
succession of governorates and act as a catalyst for improvements in the
industry as a whole. The project embodies significant institutional
changes in the water supply sector which accord with the Government's
general plans for effective decentralization of local services throughout
Egypt.
1.24     The decision by the Government to establish the Beheira Water
Company (BWC) to operate water supply facilities in the province under
Public Company Law 60/1971 (para. 5.01) is a landmark for the sector; the
Decree (Number 198 of 1981) establishing the Company was issued by the
Governor of Beheira on March 28, 1981 after approval by the Government.
This recognizes the merit of bringing more responsible management to
provincial water supply operations with the opportunity, and the duty, to
improve service to consumers. The proposed Beheira Project helps further
the Government's decentralization objectives. Following the Government's
intention to remove, as quickly as possible, constraints to infrastructural
development the Beheira Water Supply Project offers one opportunity for
testing how effectively this can be done.
1.25     The development of an effective training program complements the
institutional arrangements in Beheira and helps provide the base for the
overall sector objective of local water supply autonomy supported by
properly trained operators and responsible managers.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT AREA
General Features
2.01     The area to benefit from the project is almost the whole of the
Delta Governorate of Beheira, the area of which is about 10,000 km2.
Although representing only about 1% of Egypt's land mass the Governorate
contains some 6.5% of the country's total population in one of the most
fertile regions of the world. The bulk of the population is settled in the
rich alluvial area bounded by the Rosetta branch of the Nile, the Western
desert and Alexandria and the Mediterranean sea to the north; to the south
the province extends in a narrow tip to within 40 km of Cairo (Map
IBRD 15469).
2.02     The principal communication links are with Cairo and Alexandria by
road and rail, in a north-south direction, but an extensive system of sec-
ondary and feeder roads exists throughout the province. Bridge crossings
of the Rosetta Nile also join Beheira with the adjacent province of Kafr El
Sheikh and there are several major irrigation canals which provide source
water for drinking and are important for passage of the many graceful sail-
ing vessels (feluccas) trading along their length.
2.03     The present population in the area is 2.75 million and is expected
to reach 4.5 million by the year 2000. For administrative purposes the
province is divided into 13 markazes, each with a markaz capital. Below
the markaz is the village which may contain a collection of settlements
called ezbahs.
2.04     The bulk of the population is engaged in small scale farming based
on flood irrigation; average annual rainfall recorded at Damanhur is only
140 mm.  Grain and vegetables form the base of the agriculture, but, cotton
also is an important cash crop. The economy in the area is also geared to
agro-industry and has appreciable manufacturing capacity of a varied list
of commodities in factories clustered around the urban areas.
Level of Service
2.05     About 80% of the estimated 1980 population of 2.75 million of
Beheira Governorate is receiving public water supply from existing facili-
ties which produce approximately 200,000 m3/day. Out of this amount of
available water, 57% is delivered from water treatment plants drawing on
surface sources, 37% from boreholes and the remaining 6% is accounted for
by imports from the adjacent governorates of Alexandria and Kafr El
Sheikh. In general the quality and level of service received by customers
is quite inadequate averaging 45 lcd or less; this is particularly true in
the rural agricultural areas where most of the population lives. In some
instances the lack of disinfection equipment, or the absence of proper
operating procedures, may result in water being delivered which could even
be a risk to public health.



2.06     Some 26% of the population receive water through individual con-
nections; the remainder, mostly in the rural areas, obtain supplies from
public standpipes. There are nearly 5,000 standpipes and over 80,000 pri-
vate connections in the existing distribution systems; it is estimated that
up to 70% of the meters on private connections are inoperative and need
replacement. About 1.6 million receive water at the public standpipes and
570,000 through private connections, mostly in the urban areas. All too
often, however, delivery fails in the rural areas and consumers are forced
to use polluted canals and wells for their personal needs.
Production
2.07     The underground supplies in the area are generally confined to the
south while to the north of the province reliance is placed on Nile water
abstracted from general purpose irrigation and transport canals. In the
north, increasing salinity, or a build up of iron and manganese in the
groundwater, renders it unsuitable for drinking. Where feasible and
economical, a combination of treated surface water and groundwater is fed
into the distribution systems; this applies mainly in the central region of
the province.
2.08     The GOPW's Abbu Hummus treatment plant, augmented with inputs from
its plant at Fuwa in the Governorate of Kafr El Sheikh, provides more than
half the total amount of water available for distribution. The AWGA
supplies part of the north-west Governorate from its plants at Maryut. The
GOPW is in the process of commissioning a new plant at bhubra Khit which
will add another 34,560 m3/day capacity and is also building a plant of
17,280 m3/day to serve the town of Kafr El Dauwar. Existing municipally
operated plants at Damanhur, Kafr El Dauwar, Mahmudiya and Kom Hamada in
total provide only 33,400 m3/day; the main Damanhur plant with a nominal
capacity of 17,280 m3/day is regularly overloaded by as much as 80%. The
current overall deficit in production is estimated at some 40% and increas-
ing steadily.
2.09     The treatment plants are of the conventional type with chemically
assisted clarification followed by rapid filtration. A number of the older
plants are obsolete and overdue for retirement; the two oldest plants in
the provincial capital of Damanhur, built in 1908 and 1932, are museum
pieces but still manage to add to supply. The Abbu Hummus plant, 60,500
m3/day capacity, now 25 years old, was built to a high standard but has not
been adequately maintained.
2.10     More recent water treatment plants built by GOPW are to a
Czechoslovakian design. These plants built throughout Egypt were part of
an eastern bloc trade agreement for the supply of waterworks equipment.
The plant being commissioned at Shubra Khit, the new Damanhur plant and
that under construction at Kafr El Dauwar are of this type. They employ
horizontal flow clarifiers followed by filtration and disinfection. Even
in those newer plants, poor quality construction, incorrect operation, lack
of maintenance and inherent design faults are already causing problems.



- 9 -
2.11     Aluminium sulphate is the coagulant used at all plants to assist
clarification. Dosage and strength are poorly controlled, resulting in
highly variable clarified water passing to the filters. Desludging is not
carefully managed and alum passing from the clarifiers adversely affects
filtration. Problems with the filters start with blocked nozzles, poor
construction of the floor supporting the filtering media and continue
through to faulty or inoperable controls. In the old plants, backwash
rates are insufficient to clean the filters properly. Correct operation of
plants is also hampered by lack of metering and monitoring gauges
compounded by shortcomings of the operators.
2.12     Analyses of the raw water abstracted for supply indicates its
suitability for potable use, after treatment. The water is alkaline, with
moderate hardness and free from excessive levels of iron, zinc, lead,
manganese, copper, etc. or other potentially harmful substances. At some
intakes bacteriological contamination is becoming a problem reinforcing the
need for fully adequate disinfection procedures and precise quality con-
trol. The completion of the high dam at Aswan in 1964 had a significant
effect on the quality of the Nile water; silt and suspended solids were
reduced and the problems of algae growth began to manifest itself. The
growth of nutrients at the dam is a result of increased sunlight penetra-
tion of the settled water. The reduction of colloidal matter in the raw
water, coinciding with the increase in algae, has added to treatment
difficulties.
2.13     Abstractions from boreholes, where water sources are satisfactory,
are distributed without treatment, other than chlorination. Throughout the
Delta, the water table is within 1.5 meters to 2 meters of the surface with
a water bearing aquifer about 50 meters deep; pumping drawdown is usually 3
meters. Protection of abstraction points against pollution is currently a
problem and all the more necessary with present inadequate or non-existent
disinfection procedures. Forty-five boreholes supply villages in the south
of Beheira and fifteen boreholes augment the GOPW supplies in its regional
system with capacities up to 20 I/sec. The existing facilities are shown
on Map IBRD 15469.
Distribution
2.14     The length of distribution systems served by the GOPW treatment
plants is about 1,300 km and 150 km for the urban systems, for a total of
1,450 km. About 90% of the system does not exceed 300 mm in diameter and
of this more than half is in the 100 mm to 150 mm range. Where GOPW
regional pipelines pass through, or are adjacent to urban areas, these are
cross-connected with the municipal system to permit interchanges of supply.
2.15     The extent of the distribution and the manner in which it has
grown has created problems in maintaining its operating efficiency. Until
recently no complete hydraulic analysis had been made of the system taking
into account all the possible variations of feed sources; the system has
many dead ends which, if looped, would permit supply in two or more
directions, thereby offering the possibility for improving pressures if
production could be increased.



- 10 -
2.16     Water shortages in the systems are due to lack of production
capacity and losses in the distribution system. About 50% of all water
produced is unaccounted for. A 1979 field test on 30 km of the Abbu Hummus
regional distribution system (less than 3% of its total length) located 66
leaks. The quality of water delivered into supply is also of concern,
particularly with regard to adequacy of disinfection at borehole sources.
2.17     All potable water is pumped to supply into a distribution area
almost completely flat. There is practically no elevated land on which
economical storage can be built. Thus only 6,000 m3 of elevated storage
exists at 13 locations. The bulk of the clear water storage is at ground
level at the treatment plant but is limited in capacity to between 3 to
5-1/2 hours of the nominal plant output; overall storage capacity is in
imbalance with the rest of the system.
Other Supplies and Developments
2.18     Besides the Kafr El Sheikh (from Fuwa treatment plant) and
Alexandria inputs referred to in para. 2.05 two sources of supply are
operated separately in Beheira; one in the south is operated by the South
Tahrir Reclamation Authority, serving about 75,000 inhabitants from 35
boreholes with an average output of about 20 1/sec, per borehole, the other
is at Wadi el Natrun, an isolated farming area in the south west of the
province with a population of about 17,000. About 10,000 live in the town
of Wadi Natrun. In this area water supply is obtained mostly from
boreholes because surface water in the Wadi is saline. Neither of these
systems is suitable for integrating with the Beheira regional systems.
They will continue to be operated separately.
2.19     A proposal to build a new city in the south-west of Beheira is
also of significance. To be called Sadat City it is part of a national
planning strategy to divert population from Cairo and Alexandria and is
intended to have an eventual population of 500,000; some construction has
already started. In the first five years a water requirement of 20,000
m3/day is forecast; supply initially will be from groundwater and source
development is being considered separately from this project as part of the
whole infrastructural need for the town.
Sewerage
2.20     The only existing urban sewerage system is in Damanhur; presently
it serves some 50% of the population but is currently being extended.
Three other sewerage systems are under construction, namely, Kafr El
Dauwar, Mahmudiya and Shubra Khit all due for completion in 1983/84. By
1985 these towns should be fully sewered and represent about 60% of the
total urban population in Beheira. The other 40% of urban population is
served by septic tanks and soakaways, except in the areas where standpipe
water is supplied; in these instances dry disposal methods are used.



- 11 -
2.21     In the Government's budget about LE 10 million is committed in
Beheira to wastewater disposal in the urban areas, over a five-year period
up to 1983. The on-going works represent LE 2 million for treatment, LE 5
million for sewers and a further LE 3 million is budgeted for future
works. When completed these works will provide service for about half a
million urban dwellers.

CHAPTER III
DEMAND ASPECTS
Population
3.01     The population projections for Beheira were derived from informa-
tion obtained in the 1976 census by CAPMAS.  From this data, it is
estimated that the 1980 population is about 2.75 million, which by 1990, is
expected to rise to 3.5 million at a growth rate of 2.44% per annum,
slightly higher than the national average. About 6.5% of Egypt's total
population lives in the province.
3.02     Approximately 75% of the total population is in the rural areas in
villages or ezbahs, a community unit which may vary from a few households
to several thousand people. The urban population (720,000) is located in
13 centers. The largest community is the capital city of Damanhur with a
population of 205,000, followed by Kafr El Dauwar with 180,000 and Idku on
the coast with 70,000. Ten other communities account for about 30% of the
total urban population in sizes ranging from 20,000 to 45,000.
Forecast of Demand
3.03     Projections of water demand are normally based on historical con-
sumption patterns. In Beheira this has been difficult for two reasons:
(i) no fully adequate metering exists either at the production or consumer
end of the service; and (ii) there is a large and growing suppressed
demand. Existing production has been estimated on pump ratings and limited
metering. It is estimated that about 70% of the household metering in
place is defective. Forecast trends are based on available information
supplemented by data obtained in other parts *of Egypt.
3.04     In preparing the Beheira Project, two horizons were considered,
one supplying needs up to 1990, the other to year 2000. The levels of
service decided upon anticipate a growing per capita demand as service
improves. By 1990, the period through which the Bank project aims to
serve, nearly half the total demand will be delivered at public standpipes.
3.05     Estimates of supply at standpipes were derived from field studies
and with the objective of making sufficient drinking water available as a
counter attraction to consumers using other unsafe water. For private
connections, estimates are based on housing grades with different standards
of plumbing. The basis of the demand projections is summarized below:



- 13 -
Liters/Capita/Day
Consumer Class              Description              1980      1990    2000
A         High class with luxury dwellings
with multiple fittings              180       190      200
B         Middle class to good standard
housing with full plumbing          115       125      140
C1         Low grade apartments; one tap
per dwelling with shared
toilet -  Urban                      90        90       90
C2        Low grade dwellings, generally
in rural areas                       65        65       65
D          Consumers on standpipes              40        40 /1   40 /1
/1 For the purpose of demand projections 15 lcd has been added for small
trades, institutional use and supply at mosques; water supplied under
these categories will be metered. The standpipe requirement based
approximately on 55% carried away, 35% used at the standpipe for
washing and 10% wastage.
3.06     The overall objective is to supply 90% of the urban consumers by
private connections and 10% by standpipes; in the rural areas the privately
connected consumers ultimately will represent 5% of those supplied and the
other 95% will receive water at standpipes. Urban area demand is projected
on the following proportion of consumer classes served in 1990.
Class
A           B          Cl
Towns less than 50,000              0.0         17.5        82.5
Towns 50,000 to 150,000             8.5         27.5        64.0
Towns over 150,000                 17.0         30.5        52.5
Until now, industry has developed its own supplies because of the general
non-availability of the public service. In the large towns, between 1% to
2% of metered public water is presently consumed by industry. Industrial
demand is probably suppressed by the inadequacies of the existing systems
and consumption could be expected to increase when more water becomes
available. To allow for future industrial demand in these towns 10% has
been added to the estimated domestic consumption and a similar amount for
institutional and municipal use.
3.07     The estimated production requirement is derived from consumer
demand plus unaccounted for water into which is factored an allowance for
peaks occurring above the daily average. Annex 6 illustrates the current



- 14 -
and projected available water for distribution after allowing for un-
accounted for water, consisting of system leaks, losses at service con-
nections and water consumed but not paid for due to inaccurate metering or
illegal connections. Based on peak demands of 25% above the daily average,
the current deficit in production is about 70,000 m3/day. This deficit
could be cut significantly if the system losses, now running at 50% of
production, can be reduced.
3.08     Projections have been made on the premise that unaccounted for
water will reduce from the current 50% to 30% of production by 1985; the
first reduction will begin in 1982 when the rehabilitation program, to be
initiated under the project, begins to take effect.  By 1984, when about
55% of the new production capacity will be in place, the demands of the
served population will be fully met; by project completion production will
meet all expected demands to 1990/92.
3.09     About 80% of the nominally served population now has access to
public water; the remainder rely on private sources. By 1985 when the
project is completed the fully served population will have increased to
nearly 90% and by 1990 to 95%. Just over 2.0 million are now receiving
some service from public systems and another 155,000 by AWGA and other
agencies; by 1985 and 1990 the total served population will reach 2.8
million and 3.3 million respectively.
3.10     Allowing for losses the daily availability of water for distribu-
tion is less than 100,000 m3/day; after expansion of the treatment plant
capacity and completion of the remedial works availability will increase to
about 300,000 m3/day. This amount could increase if water losses could be
brought under the 30% target.

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01     The project is a lead effort in Government's attempts to decen-
tralize responsibility for basic services to the governorates and has four
basic objectives; (i) to assist the Government with its plans for decen-
tralizing the water supply sector; (ii) to assist in the provision of
training for the sector, which is required if decentralization is to
succeed; (iii) to improve cost recovery and introduce better financial
policies in the sector; and (iv) to rehabilitate and expand the existing
facilities in Beheira to fulfill suppressed demand for safe, reliable
drinking water and provide for the requirements of future growth. The
project will double existing production capacity and, with remedial work
and leak reduction on the distribution, will increase available supply from
a current 99,000 m3/day to 294,000 m3/day by 1990. Another 250 km will
be added to the existing distribution system and extensive new metering
provided. The lessons learned and management techniques installed by the
project entity are expected to be replicable in Egypt.
4.02     The present population now has access to limited public water
supply. The project will provide water to an additional 800,000 inhab-
itants; 485,000 will receive water at standpipes, of which 130,000 are
urban and 355,000 rural.
Project bcope
4.03     The project is broadly aimed at improving the existing water
treatment plants and distribution facilities of the existing municipal and
GOPW operated systems in Beheira and includes a major expansion to cater
for suppressed demand and future population growth. A key element, of
highest priority, is the rehabilitation of 12 treatment plants and a phased
program of leak detection and repairs to the extensive distribution system
to reduce excessive leakage.
4.04     Over 100 borehole systems serving north and south Beheira will be
repaired and refurbished through the project and provision is made for the
installation of chlorination equipment to safeguard these supplies. As
part of the mains rehabilitation program, in rural areas, about 4,000 pub-
lic standpipes will be upgraded and provided with proper drainage facili-
ties to reduce current pollution risks. In the urban areas 180 new
multiple head standpipes will be installed to serve poor inhabitants
without access to safe water.
4.05     The project includes a meter replacement program for privately
connected customers on the basis that at least 70% of the existing metering
is ineffective. In addition all standpipe service will be metered through-
out the distribution to enable revenues to be raised from these services.



-16 -
Additional bulk metering will also be installed at the existing water
treatment plants, which are being rehabilitated, and at new and expanded
production facilities to improve operational control; bulk meters will also
be installed in the network.
4.06     With the establishment of the BWC to integrate and operate exist-
ing and expanded systems, new office accommodation and staff housing is
required.  This is provided under the project by a headquarters building to
be located in Damanhur and also by five district centers in the distribu-
tion area; vehicles and equipment will also be supplied.
4.07     A regional water supply training facility is included as a com-
ponent, to be built and operated by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
under the aegis of the GOPW or its successor. Funds for buildings, student
accommodation, equipment etc. are included, as are teaching expertise and
course material for programs to be devised by the PIU and its consultants
during project implementation. Since the PIU will primarily be responsible
for executing the physical and other components of the project, assurances
were obtained from the Government, during negotiations, that the PIU,
adequately staffed, will continue to exercise this function.
4.08     A health component is included in the project and is intended to
complement the introduction of the improved water supply services by
encouraging consumers to make proper use of water and by following good
sanitation practices. The goods to be procured under the health component
will be audio-visual and demonstration equipment, vehicles and materials
for raising health awareness. Consultant services are provided for final
design of all project components, supervision of construction and for
management and financial assistance to the BWC.
Project Description
4.09     The project elements, together with contract numbers, are listed
in Annex 1 and shown on IBRD map 15469. The components are summarized
below:
(i)  Rehabilitation
(a) Leak detection and repair of existing distribution in
selected areas of the system with serial extensions as
required.
(b) Upgrading and improving existing treatment plants at
Damanhur, Kafr El Dauwar, Abu Hummus, Shubra Khit, Kom El
Farag, Buseili, Kom Hamada, Khatatba and Mahmudiya.

(ix)  Health Component
A provisional sum of US$200,000 has been allowed in the project
costs for this component. The focal agency for this component
will be the local health authorities acting in co-operation with
the BWC in providing publicity, training materials and health
demonstrations as part of a program still to be drawn up.

Included in the above project cost is US$981,800 advanced from the project
preparation facility for engineering and management services to finalize
designs, prepare bidding documents, help establish the BWC and assist the
PIU with project implementation.



- 19 -
4.11     The overall cost estimates, which include taxes and duties, are
considered reasonable and are based on construction costs and equipment
prices obtained by the consultant and GOPW during the preparation of the
feasibility studies and updated at appraisal using the results of recent
competitive bidding for similar work being undertaken by the AWGA under
Loan 1369. Base costs have been adjusted in the above table to reflect
costs at the end of June 1981. Designs have been prepared on adequate
preliminary data but soil investigations have only recently commenced for
the treatment plant and the precise extent of the rehabilitation work will
need to be determined as project implementation proceeds; to provide for
these uncertainties an overall figure of 15% for physical contingencies
*           (excluding land) has been allowed on project costs.  To provide for infla-
tion through the expected date of project completion the following price
escalation rates have been used; for civil works, 15% for 1981, 12% for
1982 and 10% for 1983 and onwards; for equipment supply 9% for 1981, 8% for
1982 and 7% for 1983 through 1985.
Status of Engineering
4.12     Final design and preparation of bid documents for the first
tranche of high priority works in the project has already started with con-
sultants engaged by the GOPW under a contract, signed on October 27, 1980;
this first stage will be completed by fall 1981. This initially provides
for 145 man months of engineering and management services, largely financed
by an advance of US$981,800 from IDA's project preparation facility which
the Government requested and which was approved on July 3, 1980. A total
of 1,360 man months of consultancy is provided in the project estimates,
80% to be supplied by Egyptian consultants; all inclusive average man
months consultancy cost is about US$4,800.
4.13     The GOPW and the BWC will require continuity of the ongoing con-
sultant assistance for project implementation and this is likely to be
provided by a negotiated extension of the existing contract, an arrangement
which seems appropriate. Agreement was reached with the Government during
negotiations that it will engage the consultant services not later than
December 31, 1981 on terms and conditions, acceptable to IDA, to ensure
satisfactory completion of the project.
Procurement and Project Implementation
4.14     All equipment supply and the rehabilitation of the distribution
systems and the treatment plants would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's Guidelines
for procurement. A margin of preference of 15%, or customs duties, which-
ever is less, would be allowed domestic manufacturers. For the general
civil and building work to be executed under the project, experience in
Egypt has shown that local contractors are highly competitive and may be
expected to win all the awards, this particularly includes pipelaying and
construction of water treatment plants. In addition asbestos cement pipes
up to 600 mm in diameter are manufactured and widely used in Egypt but are
unlikely to be competitive above 400 mm diameter.



- 20 -
4.15     The contracts to be bid under the project, appropriately grouped,
include supply contracts, to be internationally bid, for treatment plants,
chlorination equipment, vehicles, water meters and pipes, valves and
fittings in the 450 mm to 700 mm range. Treatment plant equipment will be
bid against a performance specification; the civil works associated with
the selected equipment will, thereafter, be locally bid and awarded among
qualified contractors. The major rehabilitation works are to be executed
by supply and build contracts internationally bid among experienced con-
tractors who will be pre-qualified.  It is proposed that pipelaying con-
tracts for the smaller diameter and up to 400 mm, be executed by combined
supply and lay contracts locally bid; above 400 mm the civil works con-
tracts would be for laying only. In the interests of efficiency and
economy, a selected number of contracts may be awarded after inviting
quotations from at least three reliable contractors or suppliers or carried
out by the BWC's work force through force account; the individual value of
such contracts will not exceed US$200,000 and be restricted to US$1.0 mil-
lion in the aggregate.
4.16     The broad objectives (para. 4.08) and plan of action for imple-
menting the health component were discussed during negotiations and agree-
ment was reached with the Government that a program will be developed and
submitted for IDA review not later than December 31, 1982 and implementa-
tion start within three months of agreement being reached on the program.
Construction Schedule
4.17     The schedule for design, procurement and construction is shown in
Annex 2. The most urgent rehabilitation works would be completed by mid
1983, the treatment plant extensions and much of the new distribution at
the end of the same year. The whole project will be implemented by the end
of 1985 in a five year period starting from January 1981. With design work
and preparation of bid documents already proceeding it is expected that the
bidding will take place mid 1981 and the first contract awards could
immediately follow credit effectiveness in the second half of 1981.
Credit Amount
4.18     The foreign exchange cost of the project would be financed by a
Credit of US$56.6 million including US$1.6 million for the re-financing of
Credit S-20 EGT representing 100% of the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent, excluding taxes and duties. The Credit would be made available to
the Government on standard IDA terms and it is proposed that US$53 million
would be onlent to BWC at a lending rate of 6% through a subsidiary loan
agreement to be concluded between the Government and the BWC. Two million
dollars would be reserved by the Government for the national training
center, the equipment and services associated with it, the health component
and US$1.6 million for the re-financing of Credit S-20 EGT. Agreement was
reached with the Government and the BWC during negotiations on the terms
and conditions of the on-lending and that the submission of a subsidiary
loan agreement satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of Credit effec-
tiveness (para. 6.21).



- 21 -
4.19     Out of the proposed IDA Credit US$55 million would be disbursed
over approximately five years as follows:
(1)  Civil works for treatment plant,            25% of total expenditure.
pipelines, buildings etc.
(US$17,000,000)
(2)  Equipment and Materials                     100% of foreign exchange
(US$26,000,000)                            expenditures.   100% of
local expenditures
ex-factory and 80% of
expenditures for imported
items procured locally.
(3)  Consultant Services for Project             100% of foreign
implementation                             expenditure and 80% of
(US$3,400,000)                             local expenditures.
(4)  Training center and health component,   (a) 25% of civil works
equipment and training services             (b) 100% of foreign
(US$2,000,000)                             expenditures and 80% of
local expenditures.
(5)  Unallocated                                 Allowance for physical
(US$6,600,000)                             contingencies and price
escalation on this
allowance.
The estimated disbursements of the IDA Credit are shown in Annex 7. The
remaining US$1.6 million is being used to refinance the water supply
engineering Credit S-20 ECT.
Monitoring Criteria
4.20     The project will be monitored by performance and progress indica-
tors which will be useful to BWC in controlling its operations and in
ensuring that the project components, being constructed by the GOPW through
the PIU, will be delivered on time and in accordance with the BWC's overall
objectives. The monitoring criteria set out in Annex 5 was discussed with
BWC during negotiations and agreement was reached that such information as
to be reported is sent to IDA for review within six weeks of the end of
each quarter. The BWC would continue to report for about five years after
project completion.
Land Acquisition and Water Rights
4.21      The land required for extensions to existing treatment plants
included in the project is already owned and under the control of the
present water supply agencies. Land on which new plants are to be con-
structed and that needed for buildings is in the process of being acquired



- 22 -
and for three of the sites compensation has already been authorized; no
delays are expected in gaining entry in accordance with the construction
program.
4.22     The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation is responsible for the
maintenance and expansion of the canals which supply water for general pur-
poses, and regulate groundwater abstractions. The existing abstraction
rights will continue to apply for all sources of drinking water and no
difficulties are anticipated in obtaining the additional supplies from the
sources presently in use. The total water requirement for the new Nubariya
plant is a fraction of the available source capacity; the abstraction
required for Idfina plant will be taken almost directly from the Rosetta
Nile and abstractions from boreholes will not exceed the present amounts.

CHAPTER V
BENEFICIARY
Introduction
5.01     The project facilities would be operated by the BWC, a new
Governorate owned joint stock company to be responsible, within the
Governorate area, for the production and distribution of potable water.
Provisions for its creation was contained in the Decree, signed by the
Governor of Beheira, authorizing the transfer of all existing public water
supply entities in the area (para. 1.24) to the new Company. The transfer
includes: (i) GOPW's regional facilities and organization at Abbu Hummus,
which is responsible for water operations over a wide area in Beheira,
collects revenues in three municipalities, neighboring villages and ezbahs
and provides bulk water to some other five municipalities; (ii) eight
municipal water schemes from municipal authorities which operate either
their own production facilities and/or purchase bulk water from GOPW's
regional schemes and are responsible for distribution and revenue
collection within the respective municipalities; and (iii) about fifty
rural borehole schemes operated by Housing Departments in the area.
Organization and Management
5.02     The BWC will be under the authority of the Governor of Beheira,
who would be the Chairman of its General Assembly. The chairman of the
Company and half the members of its Board are to be appointed by the
Prime-Minister upon proposals from the Governor. The General Assembly, on
which both central and local governments will be represented, will be
responsible for review and approval of major decisions covering policy,
annual budgets, annual accounts and borrowings of the Company.
5.03     The Company's Board, whose chairman would be the chief executive,
will have full authority regarding the achievement of its objectives. It
will be responsible for the definition of internal regulations with regard
to Company organization, management, staffing, accounting and financial
systems to ensure sound management of the Company. The chairman will be
fully responsible for day-to-day operations.
5.04     The Company will operate from new headquarters located in the
Governorate capital of Damanhur with operational divisions and districts to
be set up in other towns and areas in accordance with service and opera-
tional requirements.
5.05     The Company's take-over of full operational responsibility for the
existing facilities and such staff as are to be transferred will be carried
out through a phased program for which consultant assistance is provided
in the project. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government and the BWC that, not later than March 31, 1982 BWC will submit
to IDA, for review and comment, a phased program for its takeover of full
operational responsibilities from existing operators.



- 24 -
5.06     A target date (June 30, 1983) by which the BWC will assume its
full operational responsibility was discussed and agreed upon during
negotiations. Efforts will be made to relate the gradual transfer of
responsibilities to BWC with the rehabilitation works executed under the
project and the introduction of new systems with the objective of
maximizing the benefits expected from rehabilitation and the institutional
changes.
Management Assistance
5.07     The BWC is legally established but is still in the process of
formation. The initial management assistance it requires is currently
being provided through the use of consultants and training is about to
start. Consultants financed from the project preparation facility are
expected to continue the present efforts of setting up the Company; this
work was started during project preparation and comprised initial
organization charts defining broad lines of organization, functional and
job description and an outline of management, reporting, accounting
systems, tariff systems, training, manpower and planning. The envisaged
organization is illustrated in Annex 4. However, a number of policy
decisions remain to be taken regarding the composition of the Company's
operational divisions and districts and their alignment with service and
operational requirements to be established. The provision of continued
technical assistance in organization and management to BWC in helping to
establish its structure for which purpose funds are included in the
project. This assistance is briefly described below; outline terms of
reference, which were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations, are
given in Annex 10.
5.08     The program of management assistance to BWC includes six major
components:
(i) definition of the composition of the operational divisions;
(ii) finalization of job descriptions and statements of objectives for
all managers at both headquarters and operational divisions and
districts;
(iii)  review of initial manpower plans, training and recruitment
schedules and development of short and medium term training
programs and provision of some types of training (mainly in-house
and on-the-job training);
(iv) development of accounting, budgeting, billing, tariff system, and
financial and management reporting systems and procedures;
(v)  assisting in assets transfer to BWC, preparation of opening
balances and budgeting; and
(vi) assisting in the implementation of systems, procedures and manuals
through a detailed phased program in connection with organization
and management.



- 25 -
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that, not
later than December 31, 1981, suitably qualified consultants will be
employed to carry out the management assistance. The terms of reference
for this assignment were discussed and agreed with IDA during negotia-
tions and, the BWC will submit the recommendations for review by IDA and
the Government and adopt and implement such structures and financial and
administrative procedures as may be agreed upon.
Staffing
5.09     The chairman of BWC has been appointed and the vice chief
executives for engineering and finance have been nominated; the latter
appointments are under review. The number of staff currently employed by
the water supply entities operating in the Governorate is about 1,100.
Studies carried out during project preparation, showed that there is an
acute shortage of trained professional staff, a serious misallocation of
staff with some functions overmanned and others, especially in distribution
and waste prevention, neglected. Finally, labor productivity is generally
inadequate because of absenteeism, overmanning in some areas, inadequate
skills and poor supervision.
5.10     The BWC Decree provides certain flexibility in connection with the
number and composition of the staff to be transferred from existing
entities to the BWC. Moreover, it is understood that transfer of all staff
will not be mandatory and that criteria for this purpose will be estab-
lished by a resolution to be issued by the Minister of Housing. During
project preparation, consultants have assessed current manpower resources,
established manpower requirements and provided staffing and training
requirements for management and operation of BWC. Review and implementa-
tion of these studies will be included in the management assistance pro-
vided under the project (para. 5.08 and Annex 10).
5.11     Current personnel policies constrain sector development.  The
strict application of general Government public sector employment regula-
tions (under Law 47/1978 applicable also in similar organizations) which
feature ineffective recruitment, uncompetitive pay, automatic salary
progression and limited promotion on the basis of service rather than
individual performance has restricted personnel management and resulted in
low motivation and morale among staff.
5.12     A reasonable degree of flexibility exists however, in Law 47/1978,
as it allows public companies to set their own regulations within its
general framework. This is further strengthened for public companies which
are allowed more freedom in this respect in accordance with Law 60/1971.
Past experience in some public companies demonstrates that by using this
legal framework to its maximum extent, operations can improve significantly.
5.13     BWC, as a public company, will be entitled to set up its own
personnel and internal regulations according to Law 60/1971 and its draft



- 26 -
by-laws with considerable autonomy. However, it would be unrealistic to
expect the Government to allow BWC complete freedom in practice because of
its potential effect on other sectors. The Company could, within such
legal framework, begin to establish its own personnel management policies,
systems and procedures on the basis of its ability to adopt a more economic
and efficient approach to its operations. Along these lines, during
project preparation, consultants prepared a possible alternative salary
structure for the Company, a productivity bonus scheme and an outline of
staff performance review; these proposals require testing during project
implementation. Management assistance under the project will include
(para. 5.08 and Annex 10) consultant input for review and implementation of
such systems.
Training
5.14     A study of training requirements to achieve manpower plans for the
sector carried out during project preparation identified a training
strategy with four main aspects:
(i) rapid introduction of a program of training for existing staff in
key job groups using such existing training facilities as are
available;
(ii) phased development of a permanent program of training based on
courses to be provided at specially developed training centers;
(iii) progressive build-up of local training specialists and the train-
ing of managerial and supervisory staff to train and instruct
their subordinates ;
(iv) on-the-job training and instruction carried out in the field by
managerial and supervisory staff.
The study showed that there is an immediate need to initiate greatly
enlarged training activities both to improve the standard and efficiency of
existing operations and also to meet the manpower requirements of the
rehabilitated and enlarged systems to be run by the new institution and the
sector as a whole. This will be done by making temporary use of existing
facilities, concentrating on practical on-the-job training, and recruiting
initially outside technical assistance to be replaced by local staff as
soon as they themselves are trained and become available for giving
training.
5.15     To help implement this strategy, a preliminary training program
has been developed for execution over the next three years which envisages
the setting-up of a national water training center in Damanhur; the pro-
posed center constitutes an important component of this project. The study
identified the potential number of staff who should receive training, and
included an outline of basic training activities, and courses required for
key groups, and a phased program of training. The training center in the



- 27 -
project area is expected to provide the main source of trained staff for
BWC and similar entities in other governorates.  While efforts will be made
to prepare for the operation of the training center during the first two
years of the project's implementation, in-house and on-the-job training
will be provided BWC through management consultancy assistance (see
para. 5.08).  The consultants will provide on-the-job training through the
introduction and implementation of the systems and procedures they are
required to produce and help implement.
5.16     Preparation of detailed training programs and initial implementa-
tion of training for BWC is now on-going with consultants (Binnie Taylor,
Egypt with Coopers and Lybrand and Egyptian Associates) already engaged
with funding from the project preparation facility. They are required to
assist in:
(i) identifying urgent training needs for BWC and PIU;
(ii)  identifying immediately available training facilities;
(iii) selecting initial trainees;
(iv) recruiting in-house trainers; and
(v) completing design of training courses in accounting, manpower
planning, budgeting and internal control. Courses for
technicians, operatives and engineers will also be developed.
5.17     The estimated funding for the entire training program (other than
the construction of the training center) is US$0.8 million, which would be
financed under the proposed Credit. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that (i) the Borrower will, not later than December 31, 1981,
submit for IDA review and comment, a detailed description and schedule of
the training program, and that this program will be implemented in accord-
ance with a schedule to be agreed upon; (ii) submit for IDA review and
comment, not later than December 31, 1982, a detailed plan of action for
the operation of the national training center; and (iii) because of the
importance of training to BWC, during negotiations agreement was reached
that BWC will appoint a training and personnel officer, not later than
December 31, 1981 to coordinate training activities.
Billing and Collection
5.18     Water supply operators in the Governorate use broadly similar
systems and documentation in revenue billing and collection, with meter
reading records at GOPW's regional schemes maintained at plant level.
Meters are read quarterly, but because so many are not working, consumption
figures are mostly estimated and generally inaccurate. Malfunctioning
meters should be reported to technical departments for repair, but this is
not being followed up. Moreover, only limited facilities to recondition
and repair meters are available at GOPW's plants and in the municipalities.



- 28 -
5.19     An assessment of the billing and collection situation at GOPW
schemes in 1978 shows that accounts receivable amount to almost a year and
a half of sales; particularly large outstanding debts have arisen with
public sector and Government agencies. This highlights the ineffectiveness
of the existing procedures. The rationalization of BWC's billing and
collection procedures is a major task that will be addressed in the
management assistance program (para 5.08). Close cooperation between BWC
and AWGA in adjacent Alexandria and access to AWGA's meter repair and
testing facilities is anticipated during the early years of BWC's formation.
Accounting Systems
5.20     Two different accounting systems are used currently by water
supply operators in the Governorate: (i) GOPW's system which is based on
Government's cash accounting system, modified to comply with Standard
Accounting System (SAS) applied in general organizations, and comprises a
set of accounting principles and coding mostly designed for national
economic planning rather than strict accounting principles; and (ii) the
Government cash accounting systems used by municipalities and governorate
departments. GOPW's system includes a balance sheet whereas the other
system is based on cash accounting receipts and payments and does not
provide for similar financial statements. GOPW retains what revenues it
collects (at headquarters), while other operators remit all revenue
collected to the Ministry of Finance and receive cash requirements for
current expenditures through budgetary allocations from the same Ministry.
5.21     The present accounting systems are based on the concept of central
control with a minimum of delegated authority; reliance on detailed check-
ing and rechecking of individual expenditure documents is a main feature.
The accounting weakness is mostly apparent in the lack of tabulating and
summarizing financial data and thus the inability to produce integrated
management information for monitoring and analysis purposes. In practical
terms, the system has serious limitations, which undermine the meaningful-
ness of the accounting information produced, and is not suitable for the
type of financial planning and decision making necessary for public
utilities.
5.22     The need to provide the BWC with appropriate accounting systems
and procedures is critical and will form an important part of the build-up
of the Company as an effective operating agency. A specific consideration
is the need to allow self-accounting units to be introduced which will be
integrated with the introduction of the proposed organizational structure.
The management assistance provided (para 5.08 and Annex 10) will include
the complete design of accounting systems and procedures and assistance in
their implementation. Training of accounting staff is also a part of this
assistance.
Audit
5.23     As a general authority, GOPW's accounts are audited by the
Egyptian Central Organization for Accounting and Audit (COAA). This



- 29 -
practice is also applicable at AWGA where COAA appoints an independent
auditor to provide the audit for each fiscal year. Audit of BWC by COAA
will be satisfactory following the same arrangements applicable to AWGA
where the quality of audit has been found satisfactory.
5.24     The proposed organization chart for BWC includes an internal audit
unit to report to the finance manager (Annex 4); management assistance pro-
gram will provide the development of internal audit systems and procedures
and related training to ensure efficient operation of the unit.
5.25     During the next two years at least, BWC will be in the process of
formation. Simultaneously, its accounting systems and capabilities will be
built up as consultants develop its accounting systems and training is pro-
vided to augment the level of accounting staff performance. It is there-
fore more realistic to expect BWC to start submitting to IDA its audited
financial statements for 1983 and continue to submit such statements for
the years thereafter, six months after the end of its fiscal year.
Agreement was reached on this timing during negotiations.
Insurance
5.26     BWC, as a newly formed entity, will be required to arrange
appropriate insurance coverage in accordance with good public utility
practice and assurances on this point were secured during negotiations.

CHAPTER VI
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Present Situation
6.01     Because of inadequate accounting information for the water supply
operators in the governorate no reliable financial statements showing their
past and present results are available. However, a pro forma estimate of
expenditures of water supply operations in the Governorate has been pre-
pared as well as estimates of the value of fixed assets in operation
(Annexes 8 and 9). An overview of the performance of the existing entities
indicates that they consistently sustained overall deficits. During the
period reviewed income from operations was about one third of operating
expenses and from 15%-20% of total operating costs, depreciation included.
6.02     Indequate system management and pricing policies are the two major
causes of these deficits; owing to inadequate maintenance, at least 50% of
actual water production is unaccounted for thus leaving a significantly
reduced volume of water available for sale to consumers. Furthermore, it
has been the policy to provide free standpipe supplies, which represent
about half of total consumption. The volume of water available for sale,
from which costs can be recovered is therefore reduced to a small fraction
of total production. The situation is aggravated by the almost complete
lack of good and reliable metering and effective billing. Moreover, the
pricing policy applied to this residual charging base has remained
unchanged since 1961 thereby exacerbating the poor financial performance of
the entities.
Tariffs
6.03     Present tariff structures applied by GOPW, municipalities, and
Governorate departments are as follows:
Municipalities and
GOPW                  Governorates
(Pt/m3)                   (Pt/m3)
Households                             2.0                        2.5
Non-household                          2.0                        2.5
Government                           0.8-1.0                      2.5
Religious buildings                                                -
Standpipes
Tariffs provide for a minimum charge which corresponds to about 7 m3/month,
consumption per household.
6.04     The current tariff structure has two main characteristics:   (i)
all authorities provide free standpipe water to ensure access to minimum



- 31 -
quantities of safe water; and (ii) GOPW's current practice implies a price
advantage in favor of public institutions, apparently to give preference to
large consumers and thereby restricting costs to the public sector. These
features, combined with the fact that tariffs remained constant during the
past two decades, have given rise to a very narrow charging base, and a
lack of understanding among consumers of the real costs of providing
water. Consequently, expenditures on maintenance and replacement of exist-
ing assets have been inadequate and has hampered system expansion and
brought service to a very low level.
6.05     Progress towards helping BWC reach financial viability will neces-
sitate a gradual increase in overall average tariff levels to connected
consumers. Such a measure alone will not suffice as about half the water
consumed in the Governorate is supplied free at standpipes. It is there-
fore essential to consider some arrangements for charging for standpipe
supplies in the future without disturbing the social considerations of the
present policies.
6.06     A consideration of any proposed water tariff policy for BWC must
be prefaced by some general observations. First there are about two mil-
lion people (75% in rural areas) already living in the Governorate within
the project supply area almost all of whom are without a satisfactory
public water supply. That these people obtain water from some source for
their survival, even if polluted, is an indication that there are substi-
tutes for a public supply. The availability of free alternative supplies
from untreated canal water or unprotected groundwater sources could be
regarded by consumers as an acceptable substitute, if treated water was too
expensive for users, compared with their ability to pay. Second, until the
completion of rehabilitation works envisaged under the project, and the
completion of the main project facilities in 1986, a 24-hour public water
supply will not be readily available to most consumers; it would be
unrealistic to expect consumers to pay higher charges for unsatisfactory
services. Third, the Governorate covers a huge area comprising several
urban centers and is characterized by the relative diversification of
economic activities. Its population includes comparatively wealthy people
as well as a large portion of the very poorest. This suggests there is a
need to charge average incremental cost to those able to afford it,
possibly combined with some degree of cross-subsidization from rich to
poor. To achieve this objective a differential tariff system is essential.
6.07     An attitude survey carried out during project preparation indi-
cates that people in the supply area value safe public water and its bene-
fits and, initially, seem prepared to pay for it. There are indications
that those who can afford it, will demand private connections as soon as
possible, based on the current backlog of unsatisfied applications for con-
nections. The GOPW conducted this survey in parts of Beheira and Kafr El
Sheikh where some 1,300 households were interviewed on current sources of
supply, their adequacy and whether any value was attached to obtaining
better supply. The results of this ad hoc sampling were positive and
revealed that consumers were willing to pay for improved services anywhere



- 32 -
up to 5% of household income for safe, convenient and reliable water. Even
allowing for bias in the response which might tend to favor a project and
the exaggerated level at which water might be said to be paid for, the
general impression was obtained that the benefits of good water are appre-
ciated and are of value to consumers and should be tested.
6.08     Based on financial projections (Annex 9) the BWC will be aiming to
cover all expenditures for operation, maintenance and administration from
its revenues starting 1983 until 1986. Starting from 1984 it will earn
revenues to cover all its operating costs plus a part of its depreciation,
or debt service, whatever is higher so that from 1987 onwards it should be
able to cover all its operating costs as well as its debt service which is
not covered by depreciation. In order to reach such a level of cost
recovery BWC should prepare tariff proposals for implementation not later
than July 1, 1982; the consultants to be employed (para 5.08) will provide
assistance in preparing tariff proposals (Terms of Reference, Annex 10).
These proposals should provide for a basic minimum supply at a price which
can be afforded by all consumers, and charge consumers able to afford it
the full cost of service for consumption above the basic minimum.
6.09     Financial projections assume that the first tariff increases will
take place by the beginning of BWC fiscal year 1983. Although the effects
of system rehabilitation and improved metering will only begin to take
effect about this time, the requirements of BWC's steady and gradual move
towards its operating and financial goals thereafter, render the implemen-
tation of such increase essential, as a prelude to expected system
improvements in the year after. In practical terms, this increase may be
justified by the fact that action on project implementation and conse-
quently system improvements will have started and be continuing. The
differential tariff system, expected to be implemented in parallel, should
ensure affordability by consumers compared with their ability to pay.
6.10     As indicated in para. 7.05, projected average incremental costs
are about Pt. 13/m3 (US$0.70/1,000 US gallons) compared with the present
average tariff of about Pt. 2.2/m3 (US$0.12/1,000 US gallons). Progress
towards financial viability of BWC will therefore require periodic
increases in average tariffs over the next few years. The objective would
be to reach an average tariff, in the first year of full operation of
project facilities, which, with the assistance of a differential tariff
system, will be appropriate in terms of economic cost recovery as well as
in meeting Government's social and BWC's financial objectives. It is
important to closely monitor the average level of tariffs to be charged in
these early years to ensure that these objectives are properly met.
6.11     Although the scope of the attitude survey was limited, it gave a
general indication of people's willingness to pay and suggests that the
proposed average tariff used in the financial forecasts are broadly
feasible; the tariffs can accommodate, with a differential tariff system,
the provision of basic needs which would not absorb more than 2% of house-
hold income.
6.12     Water delivered at standpipes is presently unmetered and the
Government currently views delivery of free standpipe water as part of the



- 33 -
services its local agencies provide, mostly on social and health grounds.
It is proposed under the project to install meters at the existing
standpipes, and at those built under the project; full metering of all
standpipes would be reached upon project completion.
6.13     Recovery of revenues for standpipe usage can be achieved in two
proposed phases. In the first phase, it is recommended that local authori-
ties in the Governorate contribute for standpipe usage on the basis of an
annual charge per standpipe in both urban and rural areas. The initial
assessment indicates that these annual charges, based on average quantities
of water estimated to be delivered at standpipes in the supply areas, at a
tariff ranging between 55%-70% of projected average tariff to connected
consumers through the period covered by projections (Annex 9, Table 1),
will be about LE 170 in the rural areas, and LE 380 in the urban areas in
1983. Respectively, they will reach LE 600, and LE 800 in 1986; this is
due to increases in quantities of water delivered and projected increases
in tariffs. In the second phase, after complete metering is achieved, the
local authorities may wish to continue to pay for life-line supplies at
standpipes, but should also consider adopting procedures for charging con-
sumers for excess amounts. This approach would tend to discourage waste,
help spread the cost of providing water more equitably over all consumers,
and avoid an excessive burden being placed on connected consumers through
cross subsidization or on the Local Government budget. For this purpose
BWC would prepare a study for charging standpipe consumers, including the
method of billing and collection of revenues, for review and discussion
with the Government and IDA.
6.14     For the moment, rural consumers, ostensibly, receive free water at
public standpipes but the unreliability or non-availability of supplies may
make this concession meaningless for many. Indirect financial support for
this class of consumer seems fair while farm prices remain controlled by
the Government and farmers receive only about half of the market price for
their products. When agricultural pricing policies are changed and farmers
receive more cash for their crops, the cost of water for standpipe users
should be more directly recovered from the beneficiaries.
6.15     Financial projections assume that local authorities' contributions
for standpipe supplies will be introduced as from 1983, allowing time for
administrative approvals and budgetary appropriations to be made. By the
time full metering of supplies is reached in 1987 the possibility of
partial direct charging is allowed for in respect of standpipe consumers.
6.16      In order to meet the cost recovery proposals outlined above,
agreement was reached with the Government and the BWC, during negotiations,
on the following:
(i) that BWC would submit to the Government a detailed tariff proposal
acceptable to IDA which will be implemented not later than July 1,
1982;



- 34 -
(ii) the Government and BWC will ensure that starting from its fiscal
year 1983 BWC's revenues will be adequate to cover all expendi-
tures for operation, maintenance and administration;
(iii) the Government and BWC will ensure that by fiscal year 1987 BWC's
revenues will be adequate to cover its operating costs, as well as
debt service not covered by depreciation. In order to reach this
level in 1987 BWC's tariffs will be adjusted progressively at the
beginning of each of its fiscal years starting 1984 and the
subsequent years;
(iv) the Governorate local authorities will pay to BWC, starting not
later than July 1, 1982, annual amounts for each public standpipe
and that;
(v) these amounts will be established annually, in accordance with
methods satisfactory to IDA, on the basis of projected amounts of
water delivered at standpipes in the following year;
(vi) proposals for the method of establishing the charges and amount of
the first annual charges to be introduced under (iv) above will be
submitted to IDA for review and comment; and additionally four
months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year in future years;
(vii) BWC will submit, not later than June 30, 1984, to the Government
and IDA, for their review and comment, its proposals for charging
consumers for standpipe usage, the method of billing and collec-
tion of revenues from users, and an implementation plan; and
(viii)  agreement was reached with Government that upon approval of BWC's
proposals under (vii), these will be implemented promptly and that
the local authorities will continue to provide payments for such
supplies to BWC, when required and to the extent not covered from
direct charges to standpipe consumers.
6.17     Since no full or complete evaluation has been made of the assets
to be transferred to BWC, during negotiations agreement was reached with
the Government and the BWC that BWC will value, and revalue from time to
time, its fixed assets in accordance with methods satisfactory to the
Government and to IDA.

6.19     The projected financing plan shows that BWC's growing ability to
finance a small portion (3%) of its construction cost from its internal
cash generation, during the first six years of its establishment, is at
least sufficient to cover the Company's debt service requirements during
these years. This is expected, as BWC will be unable to collect
significant revenues before 1987 until the project facilities become fully
operational and the effects of the rehabilitation works are felt. The
first call upon BWC's small, but growing revenue potential will be needed
to meet its debt service obligations. Consequently, any contribution
towards investment program requirements from internal funds is not
anticipated during this period.
6.20     As discussed elsewhere (para. 6.16), BWC would be able, with
gradual increases in tariff and standpipe charges, to cover its debt ser-
vice beginning in the year 1987 and meet the financial covenants as agreed
during negotiations. In the four years following completion of the project
BWC's internal cash generation will cover all its debt service requirements
and provide a considerable portion of its capital requirements.
6.21     The portion of the proposed IDA credit to be on-lent to BWC is
expected to cover about 43% of BWC's project costs and total funding
requirements. The subsidiary loan agreement (para. 4.18) for on-lending
part of the IDA credit from the Government to BWC will provide for a term



- 36 -
of 26 years, including 6 years of grace and carry interest at the rate of
6%. This rate is considered appropriate in view of the pioneering aspects
of the project in promoting far reaching reforms in the sector by a new
company and that it is aimed at serving the poorer segments of the rural
and urban population throughout the Governorate. Government contributions
to meet the balance of BWC's fund requirements (about LE 48.1 million) will
be in the form of equity. This does not include local authorities' pay-
ments for water delivered at standpipes. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with the Government that it will provide in the form of equity,
or cause to be provided, funds to BWC for meeting the requirements of its
investment program as well as for covering the balance of its cash flow
requirements to the extent not covered from its own sources.
Future Financial Performance
6.22     BWC's projected financial statements are given in Annex 9 (Tables
1-3). As indicated elsewhere (para. 6.01) they represent consolidated
accounts of the future constituents of the BWC on the basis of a gradual
build-up of the Company and implementation of its organizational structure
coupled with improvements in service, metering and billing and introduction
of new accounting systems.
6.23     The proposed revenue arrangements are necessary to encourage a
gradual evolution of present constituents of BWC into an entity which is
financially viable. BWC is not expected to earn a positive net income,
after interest, until 1989. By the year 1987, BWC should be able to con-
tribute towards its investment requirements with internal funds equivalent
to about 1% of its total net fixed assets in operation, increasing to reach
about 4.3% in 1990. Its debt service would be adequately covered from
internal funds from 1987 onwards, coverage in the range 1.5 to 2.0 times.
6.24     Because the major part of BWC water facilities will be completely
new, and the existing systems to be transferred have been initially evalu-
ated on the basis of their current replacement cost, no allowance has been
made for further future revaluation of fixed assets in the financial
forecasts. However, agreement has been reached that BWC will value, and
revalue from time to time, its fixed assets in accordance with a method
satisfactory to the Government and IDA. Test calculations indicate that if
fixed assets were to be annually revalued in line with estimated inflation,
projected tariffs would produce rates of return ranging from 0.1% to 2.0%.

CHAPTER VII
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS
Health Benefits and Environmental Impact
7.01     The present level of public water supply service in Beheira is
generally unsatisfactory. Inhabitants, particularly in the rural areas,
are often forced to use water sources that are polluted; in some instances
even the public supplies are suspect. The project is designed to correct
this situation by ensuring that a maximum number of consumers will enjoy
safe reliable water through upgrading and expansion of the existing
facilities.
7.02     The additional water supply in the urban areas will not cause
problems because satisfactory provision exists or is being made for
wastewater disposal (paras. 2.20 and 2.21); similarly in the rural
districts traditional dry sanitation measures will continue to be used in
the absence of indoor plumbing and flush drainage. For privately connected
consumers in the smaller communities effluents can be disposed of satis-
factorily if discharged to suitably designed septic tanks and soakaways.
To ensure that the project facilities are properly used and to provide the
maximum benefit to the inhabitants, funds are provided in the project to
assist the local health authorities initiate a complementary health program
in association with the BWC.
Least Cost Solution
7.03     Alternative methods of providing supply is by groundwater and sur-
face sources of which a combination is now used. The engineering studies
examined these alternatives fully and costed seven different options at
discount rates of 8%, 10% and 12% in considering how best to provide the
additional capacity required for the project. The continued use of the
present borehole systems and expansion of treatment works drawing on sur-
face sources proved the least cost solution. The hydraulic analysis of the
distribution was also completed within the context of the source study, and
pipe sizing and location designed on the basis of the least cost solution.
Economic Analysis
7.04     In the absence of a reliable water supply and because of the
almost complete lack of metering and the fact that about half of the water
delivered is consumed free of charge at standpipes in rural and urban
areas, no meaningful rate of return can be calculated on the basis of
present declared willingness to pay.
7.05     The economic Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of water in the
Covernorate has been calculated on the basis of the economic project cost
and associated works and incremental operation and maintenance costs. The
AIC approximates 13.0 pt/m3 with an 8% discount rate and 14.5 pt/m3 at
10%. The average tariff proposed of 13.0 pt/m3 for connected consumers



- 38 -
would enable BWC to meet its revenue covenants in the first full year of
project operation (1987) with the assistance of a differential tariff
system (para. 6.06) and would therefore be appropriate.
Impact on the Poor
7.06     With the present unsatisfactory supply situation it is the poorer
inhabitants, who rely on standpipes for water who are usually the first to
suffer when system pressure drops. At the moment some 120,000 in the urban
areas obtain water from standpipes. The project will provide standpipe
water for a further 130,000 urban inhabitants and benefit a total of
250,000. In addition to the urban dwellers 355,000 low income rural
inhabitants will receive standpipe water. The tariff proposals, which
allow for standpipe users to continue to receive free water for life-line
supplies at these outlets, should encourage use of the public supply in
preference to other sources.
Risks and Safeguards
7.07     The main risks in the project would be delays in its physical
execution and problems with the establishment of the BWC as a viable water
authority because of a lack of trained staff. The effect of a two year
delay in execution, for example, would increase the average incremental
cost of water from 13 pt/m3 to 15 pt/m3 and continued staffing difficulties
would lead to further financial losses and delay the repair program aimed
at reducing water losses. A key element in Company staffing is the quality
and effectiveness of its general manager, financial director and its chief
engineer all of whom must be high caliber, particularly the general
manager, if the institutional effort is to succeed. Any lack of dedication
or motivation at the top would undermine BWC's effectiveness.
7.08     Steps have been taken to prevent delays in project execution by
use of the Bank's project preparation facility. Consultants have already
been appointed and are working on the preparation of bidding documents for
the first tranche of the investment program under the project, which should
make it possible for contracts to be awarded in the latter part of 1981.
The consultants working with the COPW are concentrating on rehabilitation
contracts and essential equipment supplies to maximize use of the existing
facilities. To assist with the establishment of the BWC, management con-
sultants are also currently helping to set up the new organization by con-
solidating accounts, asset transfer, systems management and with a profes-
sional search for key staff; in addition they are engaged in identifying
more closely the immediate training needs of the BWC and will be providing
part of it "in-house". The inclusion of a substantial training component
in the project is for the benefit of the BWC and the sector, as a whole,
and can be expected to raise the motivation and efficiency of existing
staff who will be reinforced with infusions of new trained staff. The
Chairman of the BWC, already appointed, participated in the negotiations
and is pushing ahead in critical action areas. Every possible effort has
been made to provide the BWC with the assistance it needs to get started
but it is a completely new organization for Egypt and is bound to have some
teething problems. Nevertheless, in view of the careful preparation of the
project the risks of the project objectives not being met are rated as
medium.

CHAPTER VIII
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     A recommended condition of effectiveness is the submission of a
subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA between the Government and
BWC (paras. 4.18 and 6.21).
8.02     During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that
it will:
(a) prepare, by December 31, 1982, a water supply rehabilitation
program of urgent works in provinces other than Beheira for review
with IDA (para. 1.16);
(b)  maintain a project implementation unit, adequately staffed, for
executing the project (para. 4.07);
(c) engage engineering consultants for project implementation not
later than December 31, 1981 on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA (para. 4.13);
(d) prepare a complementary health program in Beheira for IDA review
not later than December 31, 1982 and start implementation within
three months of agreement being reached on the program (para.
4.16);
(e) transfer operational responsibility for existing facilities and
staff to BWC in accordance with a program to be agreed with IDA
(para. 5.05);
(f) engage management consultants on terms acceptable to IDA to help
BWC install new management systems and procedures not later than
December 31, 1981 (para. 5.08);
(g) submit for IDA review not later than December 31, 1981 a training
program and implement it in accordance with a schedule to be
agreed with IDA (para. 5.17(i));
(h) submit for IDA review not later than December 31, 1982 a plan of
operation for the national training center (para. 5.17(ii));
(i) cause local authorities to pay to BWC agreed annual amounts for
standpipe supplies, commencing July 1, 1982 and for subsequent
years as may be agreed (paras. 6.16(iv) and (viii)); and
(j) provide, in the form of equity, or cause to be provided, funds to
BWC for meeting its investment program as well as covering the
balance of its cash flow requirements not otherwise met from its
own sources (para. 6.21).

8.03     During negotiations agreement was reached with the BWC that it
will, with the concurrence of Government where required:
(a) establish monitoring criteria for the project and report to IDA
quarterly and continue to report for 5 years after project
completion (para. 4.20);
(b)  submit not later than March 31, 1982, for IDA review and comment a
program for the takeover of existing facilities and staff from the
existing water supply operators (para. 5.05);
(c) submit to IDA for review and comment its management proposals,
after completion of studies, and adopt such procedures as may be
agreed (para. 5.08);
(d) appoint, not later than December 31, 1981, a training and
personnel training officer (para. 5.17(iii));
(e) submit within six months from the end of each fiscal year,
starting 1983, audited financial statements (para. 5.25);
(f) arrange appropriate insurance coverage in accordance with good
public utility practice (para. 5.26);
(g) submit to the Government detailed tariff proposals acceptable to
IDA to be implemented not later than July 1, 1982 (para. 6.16(i));
(h) starting fiscal year 1983 earn revenues to cover all expenditures
for operation, maintenance and administration (para. 6.16(ii));
(i) starting from fiscal year 1984 earn revenues to cover all its
operating costs plus a part of its depreciation, or debt service,
whatever is higher so that starting from its fiscal year 1987 BWC
revenues will cover all its operating costs as well as debt
service not covered by depreciation (para. 6.16(iii));
(j) establish charges for standpipes on an annual basis acceptable to
IDA and submit proposals for review by IDA four months prior to
the commencement of each fiscal year in the future (para. 6.16(v)
and (vi));
(k) submit to the Government and IDA, not later than June 30, 1984,
proposals for charging consumers for standpipe usage (para. 6.16
(vii)); and
(1) value, and revalue from time to time its fixed assets in
accordance with a method satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.17).
8.04     Agreement having been reached on the issues referred to in
Chapters I, IV, V and VI, and subject to the condition of effectiveness set
forth in paras. 4.18 and 6.21, the proposed project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of US$56.6 million (46.1 million SDR's) to the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt on the usual terms, of which US$53.0 million
equivalent would be onlent to the BWC.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
BEHEIRA PROVINCIAL POTABLE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.       Financial projections for BWC have been prepared, for fiscal years
1981 through 1990, using an estimated consolidated proforma income
statement for all the entities whose activities will be transferred to the
Company, and an opening balance sheet as follows:
Opening Balance Sheet
2.       Fixed assets, comprising water supply facilities which are assumed
to be transferred to BWC, were tentatively valued on the basis of engineer-
ing experience and assessment at their current (1980) replacement cost net
of depreciation; values were reduced where necessary to allow for rehabili-
tation required to restore assets to their normal condition.
3.       Inventories were derived from consultants' estimates.  They are
based on GOPW's historic accounts in the Company's area adjusted to include
the other operators' activities. Fifty percent of inventories representing
obsolete stocks were assumed to be written-off. Receivables are assumed
not to be taken over by BWC; however BWC will be responsible for their
collection and will establish a trust fund for remittance of collected
amounts to the Government.
4.       The net value of the assets taken over was assumed to be the Com-
pany's equity, which is assumed to be provided by the Government to the
Company.
Income Statements
Revenues
5.       Water sales have been based on estimates for water consumption of
different categories of consumers through the period covered by projec-
tions. They correspond with estimates used to develop production require-
ments, on the basis of per capita consumption allowing for current losses
of 50% of production expected to decrease to 30% in 1985 and onward. In
computing water revenues from sales to connected consumers, it was assumed
only thirty percent of total water delivered is billed in 1981 and 1982
because of the lack of proper metering; with improved metering and better
billing this was assumed to increase gradually until full metering and
billing is reached. Revenue estimates were calculated separately for
standpipe supplies and sales to other consumers based on a split between
these categories of 47% of total water consumption to the first and 53% to
the second.



- 52 -
ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 4
6.       Revenues from sales to connected consumers were estimated using an
average tariff which should increase in sequence to generate revenues
sufficient to meet, together with revenues from standpipe supplies and
other operating revenues, the Company's financial objectives. Average
tariffs are given in Annex 9, Table 1.
7.       Revenues from standpipe deliveries were estimated on the assump-
tion that, starting 1983 through 1987, when all water delivered at stand-
pipes is assumed to be metered, local authorities will be charged an annual
lump sum contribution per rural and urban standpipe multiplied by number of
such standpipes in each locality; these charges are given in Annex 9, Table
1, and are derived from estimated quantities of water delivered at these
standpipes through the application of an average tariff at a level which
will, over time, vary from 55-70% of average tariff charged to other con-
sumers. They are also given in Annex 9, Table 1. Revenue estimates for
1989 onward are based on an average overall tariff for both standpipes and
connected consumers, assuming that the level of continued local authority
contribution for standpipes, combined with a certain contribution by stand-
pipe consumers, will be worked out through a general tariff structure.
8.        Connection Charges:  A fee of LE 80 per connection (approximately
the cost of a new connection) is assumed to be introduced starting 1983.
It would increase gradually until it reaches a level of LE 120 in 1988. An
annual increase in subsequent years is assumed.
Expenses
9.        Salaries and Wages:  Salary costs f6r 1981-1982 have been calcu-
lated on the basis of current total number of employees and average
salaries including overheads and allowances and an assumed staffing
increase of 2% per annum. For 1983 onward, they have been calculated on
the basis of detailed manpower plans, developed by the consultants using
average salary and a productivity bonus of 10% to increase to a level of
50% of base salary in 1988. Salaries and wages have been inflated at an
annual rate of 9% for 1982-1983; 7% for 1984-1985 and 5% in subsequent
years.
10.      Chemicals and Power:  Cost of chemicals has been calculated on the
basis of engineering assessment of required level of treatment for both
groundwater and surface water based on a study conducted at various treat-
ment works in the area. Power cost is estimated to be LE 1.57/thousand
m3. It is assumed that cost of chemicals and power will increase
annually at a rate of 9% decreasing gradually to a level of 5% in 1984 and
subsequent years.
11.      Maintenance:  Assumed to be at an average rate of 0.5% of gross
fixed assets in operation for maintenance materials. Corresponding labor
costs have been included in salaries.

ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 4
12.      Other Expenses:  Expenses cover office and miscellaneous expendi-
tures; assumed to be 5% of total 1980 operating expenses to increase
annually along with increase in number of employees and inflated on same
basis as for other operating costs.
13.      Depreciation:  is based on;
(a) projected depreciation of existing assets assumed to be trans-
ferred to the BWC using the same rates which have been used to
determine the opening balances, until fully depreciated where
appropriate; and
(b) depreciation of newly acquired assets from year of commissioning
at the following rates:
Treatment plant, water mains, standpipes
and buildings                                     2.5%
Pumping stations, connections                       3.5%
Vehicles                                            15%
Rehabilitation works for treatment plants, water mains and pumping stations
were depreciated at 5% to allow for parallel depreciation with correspond-
ing existing assets assumed to be written-off in 20 years. Average
depreciation rate of existing and new assets is approximately 3%.
14.      Interest during construction period has been capitalized and
depreciated along with related assets. In subsequent years it is charged
to operations.
Cash Flow Statements
15.      Capital expenditures outside the present project, mainly for
distribution, are based on an investment program for the Company until
1990, which has been developed by the consultants and reviewed.
16.      Debt service payments include interest, charges and repayment of
IDA Credit portion on-lent to the Company at 6% interest, 0.75% commit-
ment charge and 20 years, plus 6 years grace period.
Balance Sheet
17.      Inventories assume a required level of four months consumption of
chemicals plus two months of maintenance materials and others.

18.      Accounts Receivable are assumed to be six months of total sales
revenues in 1981 and 1982. With expected improvements in billing and
collection through the implementation of new systems, it is assumed that
they represent for 1983 and subsequent years three months of billing.
19.      Accounts Payable are assumed to be one month of capital expendi-
tures, chemicals, power, maintenance materials and others.

ANNEX 10

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
BEHEIRA PROVINCIAL POTABLE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Draft Terms 2f Reference for
Management Consultancy Assistance to BWC
Section I
Introduction and Objectives
1.       The Government of Egypt has decided to establish a semi-autonomous
enterprise of the Governorate of Beheira to be responsible for the pro-
vision of drinking water within the territory of the Governorate. The
Beheira Water Company (BWC) will be formed by a merger of public water
supply operators in the Governorate now reporting to different Local and
Central Government agencies.
2.       The formation of the BWC is linked with an IDA financed water
supply project in the Governorate involving mainly rehabilitation of exist-
ing systems, additional production and distribution facilities and building
Company headquarters. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) had been estab-
lished within the General Organization for Potable Water (GOPW) for execut-
ing the project on behalf of BWC and to help coordinate activities for
setting up the Company.
3.       In preliminary work, management consultants have already prepared
organization charts for the Company, job description for managerial posi-
tions, staffing requirements, outline personnel policies and systems for
accounting, reporting, budgeting, manpower planning and a training pro-
gram. They are further assisting with the transfer of responsibilities
from existing operators to the Company. An implementation plan identifying
actions required to transfer responsibilities, implement new systems and
provide training in subsequent phases was prepared. This preliminary plan
will provide the basis for management consultancy described below under
Section II.
4.       The work described in the Terms of Reference is intended to
provide continuity of consultancy assistance to the management of BWC in
carrying out a smooth transition of responsibilities from the present water
supply operators to the BWC. Consultancy tasks defined in Section II
include a review and development of the original proposals and the
inclusion of sub-systems when required. Before implementation of new
organization systems or procedures, as are to be adopted, consultants must
ensure that sufficient orientation and training has been given to concerned
staff, accompanied by sufficient on-the-job training of supervisory and
executive staff. During implementation the consult2nts would be required
to monitor and evaluate progress, recommend and arrange for corrective
actions as may be required.

supply.

Section III
Relationship Between Consultants, PIU and BWC
6.       As the PIU will be directly responsible for the implementation of
the project, the selected consultants contractual relationship will be with
that Unit. However, since the BWC is the beneficiary of the services
rendered the consultants must establish a full working relationship with
the Chairman of the BWC and his staff for the performance of this
assignment.
Section IV
Work Program and Output
7.       The selected consultants must review the implementation program
referred to in paragraph 3 and assess, in detail, requirements before
starting this assignment. They would be expected to agree with PIU/BWC on
their detailed program for performing the services and the work program
would identify the number of man-months assigned to each task, or group of
tasks, and indicate when these tasks would be completed.
8.       The work program would be updated and reviewed periodically and
should indicate where critical events might adversely affect the implemen-
tation and suggest timely corrective action.
9.       Whenever the consultants are required under this assignment to
produce systems, procedures and instructions, they have to incorporate each
output product in the form of operational manuals. Manuals should be
prepared and submitted in both Arabic and English languages and should be
so arranged as to facilitate direct use by BWC's operational staff.
