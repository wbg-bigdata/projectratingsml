Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project aims at poverty alleviation by addressing the demand of the poor for priority infrastructure and services, and
support for productive activities. It will achieve this by helping to improve the policies, and expand and strengthen the
operations of the Fondo de Emergencia Social (FES). Specifically, the project will: (a) provide beneficiaries in the
poorest districts with high-priority, small-scale infrastructure, based on community demand-driven proposals and (b)
support three pilot programs designed to: (i) provide disadvantaged population groups nationwide with priority social
services; (ii) contribute nationwide to micro-enterprise development; and (iii) meet the nutritional needs of extremely
poor children, and thereby increase school attendance in selected underserved districts through an experimental program.
Progress toward these development objectives will be monitored and assessed according to the key performance
indicators outlined in Annex 1.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                                   Category              Cost Incl.      % of Total
Contingencies (US$M)
A. Infrastructure
1. Social and Economic Infrastructure Subprojects.          Physical                  54.3            68
The project would support a wide range of community-
based demand driven proposals for small-scale
infrastructure based on detailed selection criteria and
procedures set out in the Operational Manual and
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The majority of
demands are expected to be for improving existing or
new water supply, sanitation and latrine systems, pre-
primary and primary schools, health posts, foot paths,
access roads, bridges, culverts, drainage facilities,
sportsfields, and retention walls. In all cases, local
user committees would be established.
2. Community Training would be provided to staff of    Institution Building            1.2             2
line ministries, municipalities, and NGOs in
participatory planning and subproject maintenance, as
well as to beneficiaries of all infrastructure subprojects
in social management, operation and maintenance, and
environmental concerns. Local water committees
would be trained in operation and maintenance of
water and sanitation systems, and provided with a basic
tool kit. Local road committees, too, would be trained
in routine maintenance, and provided with a tool kit.

1. Supplementary School Feeding would be provided            Physical                   8.6             11
in 11 of the poorest districts. This would include the
formation of school nutrition committees, composed of
parents and teachers and a training program of parents
to ensure sustainability.
2. Social Services for Disadvantaged Groups would            Physical                   6.0              8
be channeled through intermediary organizations to
poor indigenous and Afro-Panamanian population
groups, women, youth, children and the elderly.
3. Micro-enterprise Activities would include credit     Institution Building            5.3              7
for micro-entrepreneurs channeled through
intermediary organizations (commercial banks and
NGOs), as well as training of staff of those
organizations.
C. Project Management would be strengthened                Management                   2.6              3
through training of FES staff in participatory planning
and community maintenance, environmental concerns,
micro-credit, and management information systems
and data; concurrent auditing, and project impact
evaluation; a modest amount of equipment and
vehicles; and the contracting of some specialized staff
Total             80.0             100
3. Benefits and target population:
The project is aimed at the poorest communities and population groups. Communities in the poorest districts, selected
according to an agreed poverty-targeting formula, would have access to priority small-scale infrastructure, and
disadvantaged population groups, meeting agreed eligibility criteria, would have access to priority social services. In
addition, modest pilot programs aimed at school children in the poorest districts and at micro-entrepreneurs would
improve school attendance and micro-credit respectively. The project would contribute to poverty alleviation through
additional and better mechanisms to reach and meet the needs of the poor, improved efficiency and equity in social
expenditures, and capacity building in social participation and operation and maintenance of small-scale infrastructure. It
would reach beneficiaries in the poorest regions, as well as disadvantaged population groups, contribute to greater
community involvement in poverty alleviation activities, increase access to water supply and sanitation, as well as
availability of well-maintained access roads, contribute to   micro-enterprise development, and improve school
attendance, and the learning capacity of primary school students.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 4 years (1997-200 1)
Executing agencies:
FES would be responsible for the overall project coordination, as well as promotion, appraisal, financing, and supervision
of subprojects. FES was established in 1990, and reorganized, with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), in 1994/95. Infrastructure subprojects would be requested by the communities, evaluated and managed by FES,
and implemented by agencies with the help of administrators with "legal personality" at the community level. The
administrators could be NGOs, cooperatives, church organizations, or community boards (juntas comunales), which meet
the eligibility criteria set out in FES' Operational Manual.  Social services subprojects would be requested by
disadvantaged population groups, managed by FES, and carried out by NGOs, which also meet agreed eligibility criteria.
The supplementary school feeding program would be implemented by FES, in close cooperation with the Ministry of
Education. FES would contract services with NGOs or private sector contractors. The micro-credit activities would be
channeled by FES through experienced commercial banks and NGOs, and the training component would be carried out
by experienced consultants. Training related to community strengthening, including the operation and maintenance of
completed subprojects, would be contracted out to, mainly, NGOs.
Project coordination:
Many of the project activities would be in areas which are normally the domain of the Ministries of Health (MOH),
Education (MOE), and Public Works (MOP), as well as the National Water and Sewerage Agency (IDAAN). FES has
official agreements with all of these to ensure that all subprojects are appropriate, and not duplicating line ministry
activities, as well as to ensure the line agency's ability and willingness to fund any recurrent operation and maintenance
costs of such subprojects not covered by the beneficiary communities.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.):
Overall coordination and policy guidance would be provided by FES' Board of Directors (chaired by the Minister to the
Presidency, and including the Executive Director, the President of the Assembly, and three private enterprise
representatives appointed by the President of Panama) as well as the Ministry of Planning (MIPPE). The line ministries
would provide sector-specific policy guidance.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
Financial audit reports, prepared by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, would be submitted to the Bank
annually in accordance with Bank standards. In addition, concurrent audit reports of a sample of subprojects both in
execution and completed, covering both their processing and implementation, would be prepared by the same auditor,
and submitted to the Bank quarterly.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
Apart from the audit reports, FES would submit to the Bank, twice a year, progress reports, including the updated list of
agreed performance indicators. The indicators were agreed as part of the Project Implementation Plan. Annual project
implementation reviews would assess the quantity and quality of FES' operations, as well as the work program for the
following calendar year and its recurrent and capital budget implications. An impact evaluation would be carried out
prior to project completion.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 13 846-PAN
project                               of December 28, 1994
The CAS focuses on supporting the introduction of measures that will revive sustainable and labor-absorptive growth, as
well as contribute to poverty alleviation, through (i) redirecting social expenditures to the poor and improving efficiency
of expenditures in the social sector, and (ii) implementing targeted programs. FES is an essential instrument for this, and
would provide priority infrastructure and services, as well as productive activities that would both increase incomes and
expand employment opportunities.
This strategy is being supported through a lending pipeline that includes the Economic Recovery Loan (economic
policy), Rural Health Project, Basic Education Project, Rural Poverty and Natural Resources Project, and the SIF Project.
It also will be supported by a Poverty Assessment, which would provide a poverty profile, assess the impact of major
economic policies on the poor, analyze human resources development policies, discuss the social safety net, and focus on
the statistical system and an agenda to improve it. This assessment has just started.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Despite being a country with a relatively high per capita income, almost half of the population is poor, and 23 percent
live in extreme poverty. The large majority of the poor and extreme poor live in rural areas (approximately two-thirds of
the rural population). Poverty among the indigenous population (8 percent of the total) is particularly serious. In
addition, while social spending is relatively high, its efficacy is reduced greatly by resource misallocation and wastage,
and the strong bias of social programs in favor of urban and higher-income groups. As a result, social indicators in rural
areas are similar to those in much poorer countries. The Government is aware of these challenges, and has taken
important steps to implement a comprehensive domestic reform program, including: (i) reform measures to revive
sustainable growth; (ii) new mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable; (iii) improved efficiency and equity in social
expenditures; and (iv) institutional modernization and capacity building (see "Panama-A Dual Economy in Transition",
report No. 13977-PAN of July 20, 1995).
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Specifically, the project would address the above-mentioned major poverty-related issues by expanding, improving, and
diversifying social and economic infrastructure and services provided to the poorest, thus ensuring a better allocation of
social expenditures, and contributing to capacity building, particularly of social and financial sector intermediary
organizations and communities. It would provide this both through traditional poverty-targeted socio-economic
infrastructure to complement the activities of relevant sector ministries, and through pilot efforts aimed at (i) expanding
and improving the provisions of social services by NGOs, (ii) improving school attendance, and (iii) expanding and
improving private sector micro-credit activities. All of these pilot programs would provide temporary support for
priority activities by either public or private organizations. In accordance with Bank policy, it also has a special focus on
indigenous peoples development.
…-------------------------------------------------------__-------------
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatively, the project components could have been split up, and managed by the respective line agencies. However,
for reasons of efficiency and cost effectiveness, the infrastructure components of the MOH and MOE projects are being
channeled through FES, even under other ongoing Bank-financed projects. This is in keeping with trends throughout
Central America, where line ministries are devolving responsibilities for execution of such activities to Social Investment
Fund institutions, which generally have more flexible contracting arrangements, and are specialized in meeting the
demand coming from even the smallest communities in the most remote areas. FES, too, has a proven track record in
meeting "bottom up" demand and reaching isolated, small rural communities. For similar reasons, FES was asked by
MOE to pilot the supplemental school feeding. For the micro-credit program, direct lending to the final beneficiaries
was ruled out, because FES' current arrangement is not proving very successful, and therefore the institution will shift
gears to work through small private banks and NGOs with experience in dealing with the micro-enterprise sector.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The project design reflects the experience with SIFs in Latin America set out in World Bank Discussion Paper 261 of
1994, and IDB's recent SIF evaluation report, as well as the extensive "FES Evaluation Report" drafted by an IDB
mission in early-1996. The first report mentions the need for SIFs: (i) to focus on well-defined subprojects; (ii) to be an
integral part of the Government's economic and social policy; (iii) to be operationally efficient; (iv) to obtain feedback
through proper monitoring and evaluation; (v) to be transparent and accountable; (vi) to ensure proper targeting; and (vii)
to aim at subproject sustainability. The second report, based on field surveys, found that: (i) SIFs have been generally
efficient, transparent, and relatively free from political interference; (ii) SIFs have helped to improve the living
conditions of the poor, and have proved to be good, efficient providers of social and economic infrastructure to the poor;
(iii) SIFs should not replace the public sector in tasks that are the Government's inherent responsibility; they should
reinforce and broaden, rather than supplant, the role of state institutions in the social field; (iv) SIFs should allocate more
resources to training and community development; (v) SIFs should integrate the environmental viewpoint into its
operations; (vi) the targeting mechanisms of SIFs need to give greater preference to women as beneficiaries; and (vii)
SIFs can get involved in credit when they play a catalytic role in reaching poor communities that have no access to credit,
and when they have a comparative advantage in the selection and control of credit intermediaries. The third report, on
FES itself, mentioned that: (i) FES would need to improve project design, and include beneficiaries in all phases from
conceptualization through completion and subsequent operation and maintenance; (ii) road projects would need to be
better identified, formulated, and appraised; (iii) FES should review and evaluate project requests according to targeting
criteria, as well as conduct on-site visits to verify the community's priorities; and (iv) FES should design and implement
a training program on technical quality for FES supervisors, project administrators, and inspectors.
All of these issues were reviewed and discussed in detail during project preparation, which is reflected in the project
composition and implementation plan. The project would have a proper targeting mechanism, introduce pilot social
services for disadvantaged groups, including women, ensure an efficient operation of micro-credit through intermediary
organizations, ensure beneficiary participation throughout the entire project cycle, and improve the definition of road
projects.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Borrower commitment has been demonstrated by the appointment of a full-time project preparation coordinator in April
1996, as well as its willingness to both undertake and finance substantial project preparation studies relating to FES'
internal organization and personnel, MIS, social participation, promotion and planning, ex-post evaluation, water and
sanitation, roads, and micro-credit. In addition, the Government has started studies for projects in the areas of women,
marginalized youth, indigenous population, Afro-Panamanians, the elderly, and children. Substantial progress has
already been seen in FES' policies and process during the project preparation process.
f2. Value added of Bank support:
* Assist Government in identifying weak points in FES' policies and operations and designing corrective measures,
especially in the areas of targeting, community participation, and environment.
* Identify overlaps between FES' programs and other development projects to eliminate duplication of effort and
maximize resource allocation efficiency.
* Assist Government in drafting TORs for prepatory studies.
* Provide international, cross-country advice on successful SIF programs elsewhere, especially in LAC countries, and

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment [X] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$   []        Cost Effectiveness  []  Other
(see Annex 4):                million; ERR=    %                       Analysis:               [Specify]
Since the FES mechanism is similar to a line of credit, no rate of return calculation or cost-benefit analysis has been or
could be carried out for the full program. However, in accordance with FES' Operational Manual, cost-benefit analyses
are carried out by FES' evaluation staff for its water supply and sanitation, as well as access road projects, which have to
meet agreed minimum criteria. With regard to micro-enterprise funding, the evaluation criteria are being worked out, and
will be part of the Operational Manual to be agreed by the Bank.
Fiscal impact (for all projects):
The fiscal implications of the project would include the: (i) project counterpart funding requirements of the Bank and
IDB of about US$20.0 million over the next four years; (ii) continuation of supplementary school feeding program after
project completion of US$0.9 million annually; and (iii) partial funding of maintenance costs of completed access roads,
small bridges, drainage ditches, retaining walls, schools, and health infrastructure of about US$1.6 million annually,
which would represent less than 0.3 percent of government expenditures in the social sectors.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)
N/A - FES is not a revenue earning entity.
15. Technical Assessment:
Technical criteria exist for each subproject type, based on existing norms from the respective public agencies to ensure
technical coherence and compatibility. These criteria are already incorporated in FES' Operational Manual (appraisal
guidelines), and elaborated in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). Technical subproject appraisal would be
undertaken by qualified technical staff from FES.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies:
The project would be managed by FES, and executed by intermediary organizations and local entities. All credit and
social services subprojects, as well as community strengthening efforts, would be handled by intermediary organizations
(NGOs and commercial banks), which have demonstrated the managerial and financial capability to do so (as assessed by
FES and its consultants). All infrastructure subprojects would be contracted out to the private sector, which has proven to
be quite capable and competitive.
b. Project management:
FES was established with USAID support in 1990 as an emergency operation, primarily aimed at employment
generation. It also received substantial support from the European Union and IFAD for rural development, indigenous,
and rural micro-credit programs. In addition, considerable government funding was provided for small-scale
infrastructure and services to all communities from a fund available to the Assembly members, but managed by FES.
FES was reorganized with IDB support in 1994/95, and established a full portfolio of poverty-targeted infrastructure.
However, all of these programs worked in parallel, and this arrangement showed considerable diseconomies of scale. A
more integrated and efficient organization is now being established with the help of an experienced consulting firm to
manage FES' proposed portfolio of poverty-targeted infrastructure, as well as pilot efforts in social services, school
feeding, and micro-credit. With competent management and staff, an excellent Operational Manual, close cooperation
with MIPPE and the line agencies, the channeling of its new efforts through intermediary organizations, and considerable
staff training, FES should be able to handle its responsibilities.

17. Social Assessment:
The preparation missions, jointly with FES staff, spent considerable time and effort meeting and listening to
representatives of disadvantaged groups, including the indigenous population and Afro-Panamanians, women, the elderly
and children. Based on those meetings and agreements reached at those meetings, an Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan (IPDP) was drafted by FES, and included in the PIP. Similarly, local consultants assisted FES and specialized
NGOs in drafting project proposals aimed specifically at disadvantaged groups. Apart from these targeted efforts, FES
developed a comprehensive program of capacity building for central and local government staff, as well as NGO and
beneficiary representatives, to ensure proper community involvement in the full subproject cycle, starting with
identification and ending with maintenance of completed subprojects. This program would be supported under the
project (see para. 19).
18. Environmental Assessment:       Environmental    []  A   [X]  B       []   C
Category
The project would have no significant environmental risks. No resettlement would occur as a result of project
investments. Standard safety and environmental procedures were reviewed during preparation, and an appropriate
environmental assessment mechanism is now being established. FES would use this screening mechanism for all
infrastructure subprojects funded under the project. As a condition of effectiveness, FES' Operational Manual, as
approved by its Board, would include appropriate references to the use of this mechanism.

20. Sustainability:
Sustainability of subprojects would be ensured through:
(a) intensive cooperation with line agencies and agreement on their responsibility for periodic maintenance of completed
access roads, education, and health subprojects (described in agreements between FES and those agencies);
(b) comprehensive program of beneficiary community training in social management and operation and maintenance of
all infrastructure subprojects, including establishment of user groups/committees for implementation and maintenance of
all infrastructure subprojects, as well as provision of toolkits for water supply, sanitation, and access road subprojects;
(c) screening of intermediary organizations for social services for disadvantaged groups to ensure that they can take over
following subproject completion;
(d) arrangement with MOE/parents to take over pilot supplemental school feeding program; and
(e) screening of intermediary organizations for pilot micro-credit program, and training of their financial analysts and
extension officers, to take over micro-credit activities, and strengthening of inter-organizational links.
Regarding the sustainability of FES as an institution, the Government is already providing a relatively large share of FES
funding, and could sustain a slightly smaller operation. The need for such sustainability should be reviewed prior to
project completion, based on the capacity of the relevant line ministries and agencies.

Annex 2
Social Investment Fund Project
Detailed Project Description
The project would support the Government, through its Fondo de Emergencia Social (FES), to: (a) meet priority, small-scale social
and economic infrastructure needs of the poorest regions (based on an agreed formula); (b) contribute through pilot programs to
strengthening primary school attendance and learning capacity, as well as priority social services for the poorest population groups;
and to boosting credit and training programs for micro-enterprises; and (c) train selected central and local government agencies,
NGOs, community groups, and FES itself in community capacity-related matters. It is described in detail below.
Project Component A: Infrastructure (US$55.5 million total cost of component)
The project would support a wide range of small demand-driven community proposals for investment in social and economic
infrastructure, based on detailed selection criteria and procedures set out in the Operational Manual and PIP. It is difficult to
determine ex-ante the precise mix of demands from the communities, but the following are the areas in which the majority of the
proposals are expected:
1. Social and Economic Infrastructure (US$54.3 million cost of subcomponent)
(a) Water Supply and Sanitation
Requests for water supply and sanitation systems continue to be among the most common demands received by the FES. Current
estimates put the national requirement at over 940 new rural water supply and sanitation projects, with an estimated value of US$26.6
million. FES is currently concentrating on selecting and prioritizing the 692 projects for which formal requests have already been
received. Combined with the Ministry of Health's ongoing community services survey, this forms the basis for FES' proposal for
financing this important component at US$15 million (apart from the amount of the US$3.5 million being financed under the Rural
Health Project). FES would assist the design and installation of an average of 200 projects per year, comprising new and upgraded water
systems, together with an integrated campaign of latrine construction. This program would benefit some 40,000 people per year with safe
potable water and hygienic excreta disposal facilities.
FES would concentrate its efforts on reaching people not presently served by conventional service delivery systems, and as a result, would
expand the use of low-cost technologies (including latrines and handpumps) in the more remote and isolated areas of the country. FES
also would increase community involvement through extended training and education programs throughout the project cycle and beyond -
employing the services of regional NGOs and the private sector.
To ensure the success of the program, FES would decentralize many of its functions to the provincial level. In particular, project
supervision and follow-up would be managed locally by assigning specialized field technicians who would be able to provide technical
assistance during the construction phase, and then continue to advise the Committee of Water Users on successful operation, maintenance,
and management procedures. To regulate this extended program, a comprehensive system has been developed by FES for recording all
the steps involved in project selection, evaluation, viability, community participation, training, and environmental impact.
Over the last two years, FES has developed a close working relationship with the national water authority (IDAAN) for identifying and
preparing peri-urban projects. Following a series of strategic planning sessions with the Ministry of Health, FES now has agreed upon a
similar coordination of their sectoral activities in the rural areas. This will elevate FES to the leading promoter and financier of small-
scale water supply and sanitation projects.
(b) Footpaths and Sportsfields
In view of the increasing importance of footpaths in poor urban and peri-urban areas, as well as simple sportsfields to help develop
youth and reduce social tension, FES would provide for limited investments in such infrastructure. Design criteria were agreed during
appraisal.
(c) Education
FES would continue a program of rehabilitation, expansion, and replacement of pre-primary and primary schools, as well as their
equipment, didactical material, and kitchen facilities. This program would amount to about US$12.5 million, but no funding would
be provided under the loan until the funding available under the Basic Education Project is drawn down. The ongoing Basic
Education Project is already providing US$21.3 million for school infrastructure channeled through FES, and this amount would
seem to cover the immediate priority needs.



(d) Health
FES similarly would continue a small program of rehabilitation, expansion, and replacement of health centers, subcenters, and posts.
However, its the priority needs seem to be covered.
(e).Access Roads and Related Facilities
The poorest communities have expressed an increasing demand for access roads, bridges, and related facilities, as well as drainage
facilities and retention walls. Recent surveys have found that 46 percent of the existing access roads are in poor condition. The
demand for rehabilitation and improvement of just these roads already amounts to US$57.2 million. With the demand for other
economic infrastructure amounting to US$6.7 million, the total demand amounts to about US$64.0 million. These figures are based
on average costs for access roads of US$21,500 per kilometer, excluding bridges and other facilities, and using least cost solutions.
FES would consider requests for access roads, provided that: (i) the communities met the agreed poverty criteria; (ii) there were at
least 80 persons/Km. within the road impact area; (iii) the road would complement other development activities in the area; and (iv)
the community had established a maintenance committee. In addition, the road would not exceed 10 Km, and have a daily traffic of at
least five vehicles/day. Maintenance for the first year after subproject completion would be provided by the contractor, and thereafter
by the Ministry of Public Works in close cooperation with the community's maintenance committee.
2. Community Training (US$1.2 million cost of subcomponent)
This subcomponent would provide for the training of staff of line ministries, municipalities, and NGOs in participatory planning
(including themes such as social sensitivity; facilitating community and public meetings; evaluating participation in FES programs
and procedures; principles of accounting and project management; municipal reform; community involvement in design, contracting,
and construction of infrastructure projects; and appropriate technologies) environmental concerns and subproject maintenance, as well
as of beneficiaries in social management, environmental concerns and the operation and maintenance of subprojects.
Training and support would be provided by NGOs, prequalified by FES, according to an annual training and support program
developed by FES based upon its yearly investment plan. Contents of training, as well as of tool kits given to communities, would be
determined in conjunction with the line ministries. NGOs charged with capacity building would also help to develop and publish
training manuals as well as guidelines for routine management and project administration. Training would include workshops,
seminars, courses, production of manuals, tools and materials for maintenance.
Project Component B: Pilot Programs (US$21.9 million total cost of component)
1. Supplementary School Feeding (US$8.6 million cost of subcomponent)
The supplemental school feeding program would: (i) improve education indicators such as repetition and drop-out rates in 11 of the
poorest districts by providing a daily meal during the school year; (ii) promote the organization of school nutrition committees
composed of parents and teachers; and (iii) complement existing government health, nutrition, and education programs directed at the
poorest segments of the population.  The program  would benefit about 100,000 primary school children in the poorest
"corregimientos" (districts) of the country with a high concentration of indigenous population. The meal would provide at least 20
percent of the daily caloric requirements to each student between 6 and 9 years old, as well as anti-parasite medication. The mothers
of the school children would then organize themselves to prepare the food, and give it to the children. In some communities, the
mothers would bring other vegetables to add to the meals. Food distribution would be coordinated by FES with the Ministry of
Education (MOE), the Controller-General Office, and other government institutions working at the local level. The food would be
contracted in bulk, received in central warehouses, and sample-tested by the Institute of Agricultural Marketing before being sent to
the provinces. Transportation would be contracted by FES to distribute the products to the schools.
To ensure the program's sustainability, a training program would be designed and introduced to teach parents in selected communities
how to organize, how to improve agricultural and livestock production, and how to produce, select, and prepare food for the schools
and households.
All of these efforts will be closely monitored, including through a major impact evaluation by no later than December 31, 1998.
Program monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the MOE, with the help of consultants, in a sample of 110 schools.
The program costs are about US$.1I per ration (US$.18 per 1,000 cal), assuming that the program provides meals 160 days/year.
The estimated annual costs of the program are as follows (in US$):

Note: It is assumed that there will be an increase in enrollment of 2% per year in the target schools.
2. Social Services for Disadvantaged Groups (USS 8.0 million cost of subcomponent)
This subcomponent would provide support through intermediary organizations for social services programs aimed at the poorest,
disadvantaged population groups, including selected indigenous communities, Afro-Panamanians, women, youth, children, and the
elderly, meeting agreed selection criteria. The programs could support any priority poverty alleViation activity requested by an
eligible organization, subject to a "negative list" of such activities (no funding would be available for public buildings/facilities,
tobacco and alcohol production and processing, churches and religious buildings, buildings to be used by political parties and labor
unions, land acquisition, firearms and any other type of weapons, entertainment and operating costs).
(a) Indigenous Communities: This pilot effort would target communities which have so far not received any assistance from the
Government or NGOs, and which have been identified by FES in consultation with other government institutions and NGOs. The
targeted groups would include: (i) Teribes in Bocas del Toro Province, (ii) Ngobe-Bugle in Bocas del Toro Province, specifically
those communities located in the Changuinola and Almirante Districts, Valle Risco, Chiriqui Grande, Salt-Cri, Silico Cri, Pueblo
Nuevo and Punta Pefla, (iii) Kunas in the Panama and Darien Provinces, Comarca of Madugandi and Wargandi; and (iv) Embera
located in the Darien Province in Ipeti and Piriati.
Social scientists with experience in working with indigenous populations are currently carrying out studies of the socioeconomic
conditions of the communities to be served. Together with the communities, their basic needs would be defined and prioritized. The
emphasis of the studies is on seeking ways to help the communities to become self-sustainable or develop income-generating
activities with the use of appropriate technology. If the identified priority needs are to include traditional FES projects, such as water
and sanitation systems and schools and health posts, the consultants would channel those requests to appropriate FES units for
processing and financing; similarly for income-generating activity programs.
The consultants would develop project monitoring and impact indicators, and would identify NGOs that could help in program
implementation and program monitoring and evaluation. It is expected that the pilot would be evaluated and revised after two years.
(b) Afro-Panamanians, Women, Youth, Children, and the Elderly: These programs would be aimed at meeting priority basic
needs of other disadvantaged population groups. The program for Afro-Panamanians would aim at the needs of their underserved
communities. The program for women would be targeted at poor female heads of households throughout the country, and would aim
at getting them out of "at risk" situations. The program for youth, directed at unemployed young adults, would aim to improve their
socioeconomic condition, and assist them in getting out of "at risk" situations. The program for children would focus on poor street
children, and would include various services to help then. The target group for the elderly program would include poor persons aged
55 and above, mostly in cities throughout the country.  Some excellent program activities have already been worked out by
representatives of those groups with the help of consultants, but, eventually, proposals could come directly from the communities and
NGOs, which would be responsible for the programs' recurrent expenditures, as well as taking over full responsibility following the
initial period.
3. Support for Productive Activities (US$5.3 million total cost of subcomponent)
This component would seek to promote the creation of employment and income through 'informal' micro- and small enterprises
(MSEs) in rural areas, secondary towns, and peri-urban areas, with particular emphasis on non-agricultural activities. It would also
aim at stimulating private banking sector involvement in the provision of micro-credit, and at building up the capacity of relevant
intermediary organizations. FES would: (i) operate a Micro Credit Fund to provide loans to MSE-intermediary organizations
(commercial banks and NGOs); and (ii) help strengthen the capacity of new and less experienced intermediary organizations (lOs).



The organization and operation of the relevant FES unit and the terms and conditions of its lending to IOs are currently being worked
out by FES with the help of consultants, and will be reflected in the Operational Manual, to be agreed with the Bank.
a. Micro-Credit (US$5.0 million cost of subcomponent)
Through the Micro-Credit Fund, FES would lend to two types of lOs: "established" IOs with a solid track record in the provision of
micro-credit, and "emerging" lOs. The loans would be provided at no less than the inter-bank rate (presently 8 percent), and carry
suitable guarantees. It is understood that small IOs would have difficulty in coming up with tangible collateral (e.g., they generally
have no real estate to mortgage), and that flexible solutions would need to be found.
No conditions would be imposed on the lOs receiving micro credit loans with respect to the level of interest they could charge to their
beneficiaries, but care would be taken that the micro-credits would have a maximum amount of US$5,000 to ensure that they indeed
benefit the smallest producers. Based on experience in Panama and elsewhere, it is expected that the average micro-credit would be
between US$1,000-2,000. The credits would be channeled as much as possible to the rural and peri-urban areas, and at least half of
the beneficiaries would be expected to be women.
The loans to established IOs would be repaid after five years, and those to emerging IOs after three years. The average repayment
period of the micro-credits themselves is estimated to be three months in the case of working capital use and 12 months for the
purchase of tools and equipment.
It is expected that FES and the IOs would contribute 30 percent of the Micro-Credit Fund. From the Fund, FES would initially
provide loans of US$0.5-1.5 million to a small number of established 1Os. Before the program would get underway, consultants
would assess the financial situation and implementation capacity of these and other established IOs to accelerate operations in the first
year of the program. The IOs would be selected on the basis of their current financial performance, outreach experience, and
commitment to financial systems, MIS, and sustainability.
Starting in the second year of the program, FES would analyze requests from smaller, less experienced 'emerging' IOs for capital
loans of between US$50,000-150,000. FES would be expected to process some 12 of these loans each year; these and other IOs
would also be subject to capacity building activities.
b. Training (US$0.3 million cost of subcomponent)
The project would also provide for the strengthening of the selected 1Os, in particular training of their financial analysts and extension
officers, This work would be contracted out to an experienced financial institution. The training of the final beneficiaries, including
training in business management, would be the responsibility of the IOs.
Project Component C: Project Management (US$2.6 million total cost of component)
1. Institutional Strengthening (US$0.8 million cost of subcomponent):
a. Information Systems
b. Support to Productive Activities (Micro-Credit)
c. Environmental Unit
d. External (concurrent/quarterly) audit of project
e. Ex-post/impact evaluation
2. Equipment and Vehicles (US$0.9 million cost of subcomponent)
3. Incremental Operating Costs (relating to programs for disadvantaged population groups, nutrition, productive
assistance and environment fUS$0.9 million cost of subcomponentl)

3) Since the project is essentially a financial intermediary type operation, and physical targets are not the main objectives of the proposed project, no contingencies
have been provided for the subprojects. Any increase in the average subproject cost would be reflected in a reduced number of subprojects executed. For food,
equipment and vehicles, a price contingency of 2.3 percent (equivalent to the projected international rate of inflation) per year has been built in.



Annex 4
Social Investment Fund Project
Cost-Benefit Analysis Summary
Cost-Benefit Analysis
1) Since the project is basically a line of credit, no cost-benefit analysis has been carried out. However, in line with its Operational
Manual requirements, and subject to minimum criteria agreed with the relevant sector agencies, FES carries out economic analyses for
subprojects with quantifiable benefits, such as for water supply and sewerage, as well as access roads. It also maintains a detailed list
of unit costs by type of subproject, which is being updated twice each year.
2) For water supply, FES distinguishes between new facilities, improvements to existing facilities, and a combination of
improvements and expansion. Benefit calculations are based on population and consumption/capita, and include consumer surplus as
estimated using the area under demand curves, which in turn are estimated from with and without project estimates of consumption
volumes and unit costs. Detailed calculations are made for each subproject using a methodology and format specified in the
Operational Manual. Consumer surplus is acceptable as a benefit in this case, because of the targeted nature of the project, and
because sustainability of these projects does not require full cost recovery. FES uses a discount factor of eight percent, and considers
all subprojects with a benefit/cost ratio equal to or larger than one economically viable. For sewerage, FES distinguishes between
beneficiaries with latrines, beneficiaries with septic tanks, and beneficiaries with a combination of these systems, and then carries out
similar calculations as for water supply. The eight percent discount factor is acceptable, because of the substantial non-quantifiable
health benefit associated with these subprojects.
3) For the rehabilitation and improvement of access roads, the agreed minimum criteria include that: (i) the number of beneficiaries be
equal or larger than 80 persons/Km; (ii) traffic will be at least five vehicles/day; (iii) the maximum length will be 10 Km; and (iv) the
design will aim at minimum-cost and a life of 10 years. Average costs are estimated at US$21,000/Km without and US$25,000/Km
with bridges and related facilities. Benefit calculations reflect, i.e., population, income level, socio-economic conditions, traffic, and
accessibility; agricultural production of the beneficiaries is projected to increase between two and four percent annually during a five-
year period following subproject completion. Again, using a discount factor of eight percent, FES considers all subprojects with a
benefit/cost ration equal to or larger than one economically viable. The eight percent discount factor is acceptable, because of the
substantial non-quantifiable benefits deriving from easier access by the communities.
4) For subprojects that do not lend themselves to quantifiable evaluation, FES has some minimum criteria agreed with the relevant
sector agencies, and otherwise relies upon the preferences expressed by the beneficiary communities. It should be noted that, for
reasons of effectiveness and cost efficiency, under the existing Bank-supported projects for Rural Health and Basic Education, the
Ministries of Health and Education, respectively, have asked FES to manage the rural water supply and education infrastructure
financed under those projects.
Fiscal Impact
2) Apart from its contribution to FES' investment program over the four-year period of mid-1997 to mid-2001, the Government will
have to take over the responsibility for the supplementary school feeding program, estimated at about USS0.9 million annually, and
share the cost of operations and maintenance of completed subprojects in education, health, and access roads, eventually amounting to
about US$1.6 million annually (see Annex 5). These incremental recurrent expenditures would represent less than 0.3 percent of
government expenditures in the social sectors (assuming that the budget remains at the current level); consequently, the Govemment
would have no difficulty meeting these costs.

) Based on the following assumptions:
(i) Water supply and sanitation facilities would be operated and maintained through water user committees, which would cover maintenance
costs.
(ii) Schools and health posts would require annually two percent of investment costs to be covered by the responsible ministries.
(iii) Roads would require routine and periodic maintenance. The first would be done by the communities. The second would require
annually four percent of investnent costs to be covered by the Ministry of Public Works (possibly with the help of a maintenance fund).
(iv) Supplemental school feeding would eventually require about US$0.9 million annually in incremental recurrent expenditures, which
would have to be borne by the Government (MOE).
(v) Social services programs would be taken over, and fully funded, by NGOs.



Annex 6
Social Investment Fund Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A):
FES would manage all procurement actions under the project, based on agreed procurement procedures reflected in its
Operational Manual and the PIP, by contracting intermnediary organizations, administrators, and consultants under standard
contracts to carry out procurement or provide services for subprojects, acceptable to the Bank. For civil works, contracts
estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent up to the agreed maximum of US$400,000, would be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB). No international competitive bidding (ICB) would be required because of the decentralized
nature of SIF operations and the small size of the subprojects. The average size of subprojects is expected to be about
US$50,000. To the extent possible, contracts for works would be combined in packages of US$250,000 or more, and
awarded on the basis of NCB.
For civil works contracts over US$30,000 and below US$250,000, local competitive shopping ("cotizaci6n comunitaria")
would apply. For minor works in scattered, distant, rural areas, direct contracting with local contractors may be used for
contracts under US$30,000 equivalent. FES has an established system of standard regionalized unit prices that would guide
the selection of contracts under such contracting. The schedule of standard regionalized unit prices would be maintained and
updated by FES from time to time.
Vehicles and computer equipment, when possible, would be packaged in contracts of at least US$250,000 equivalent, and be
awarded on the basis of ICB procedures. Contracts for other goods, vehicles and equipment costing at least US$30,000 up to
US$250,000 would be procured on the basis of NCB. Contracts for goods, vehicles and equipment costing less than
US$30,000 would be procured through national and international shopping on the basis of price quotations from at least
three qualified suppliers. These procedures would also cover the purchase and transport of food. As an exception, computer
software, for the management information system and of a proprietory nature, up to US$150,000 could be purchased through
direct contracting.
Consultants would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. In view of the mostly small
size of the contracts, little foreign consultancy interest would be expected.
Prior review thresholds (Table B):
All NCB contracts for works costing more than US$250,000 and all ICB and LIB contracts for goods, vehicles and
equipment costing more than US$250,000, as well as all contracts for computer software, would be subject to prior review.
In addition, the first three contracts of each kind for works contracted under quotations, and for goods, vehicles and
equipment contracted under NCB and shopping, regardless of the amount, would be reviewed by the Bank. The balance
would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank after the contract award. Direct contracting would be subject to a regular
review by the Bank of the standard regionalized unit prices adopted by FES every six months. For consultants, the Bank
would wish to review all terms of reference, as well as contracts over US$25,000 for individuals, and over US$50,000 for
firms.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C):
The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of about four years, to be completed by June 30, 2001. The
project closing date would be December 31, 2001 (i.e., six months after completion date).
Disbursements would be made against the following categories of expenditure: (a) FES infrastructure and social services
subprojects (70%); (b) nutrition (on a declining basis of 70%, 50%, 30%); (c) credit (70%); (d) vehicles and equipment
(100% of foreign expenditures or 90% of local expenditures); and (e) training (100%).



Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
Disbursements would be made on the basis of full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior
review by the Bank (NCB for works, ICB for vehicles and computer equipment, direct contracting for computer software,
contracts costing more than US$50,000 for consulting firms and contracts costing more than US$25,000 for individual
consultants), and amendments to contracts raising the value of such contracts above the prior review limits. Equally, full
documentation would be required for the first three contracts for both works and goods, regardless of the amount. For all
other expenditures, disbursements would be granted against SOEs for which supporting documents would be maintained by
the FES, and be available to the Bank for review.
Special account:
A Special Account would be opened in a bank, agreed by the Bank, with an initial deposit of US$2.0 million
equivalent, corresponding to about four months of expenditures under the project. The special account would be replenished
monthly at the Borrower's request (but no less frequently than every three months), or whenever one-third of the authorized
amount has been withdrawn, whichever comes first. In view of the need for substantial advances to FES' administrators (see
Block 1, para. 4), following a comprehensive review of FES' financial administration, and subject to agreed corrective
action, the Special Account would be operated on the basis of the 90-day advance procedure.

2) No ICB is expected because of the dispersed nature of the FES operations and the small size of subprojects. The
average size of subprojects is expected to be about US$50,000, and the maximum USS400,000. To the extent
possible, contracts for works would be combined in larger packages.
Shopping (US$12.0 million) and direct contracting of works in cases where it is reasonable to conclude that only
one offer is available, and where the contract would be less than US$30,000 up to US$1.7 million. The contracting
would be carried out on the basis of standard regionalized unit prices, to be maintairred and updated by FES at least
every six months. This procedure is acceptable to the Bank in view of: (i) the need to simplify the administration of
a great number of small contracts; and (ii) the introduction of a quarterly external audit of sample subprojects and
the relevant procedures.
4) Only computer equipment.
5) Including supplemental school feeding.
6) Including shopping, estimated at US$2.9 million, and computer software to be procured by direct contracting,
estimated at US$150,000.
7) Including consultants, quarterly auditing, training, and related travel and materials. Contracts would be expected
to be awarded on the basis of quality and cost based selections. The exceptions would be least-cost selection up to
US$0.2 million, single source selection up to US$0.3 million, and selection of individuals up to US$0.8 million.
