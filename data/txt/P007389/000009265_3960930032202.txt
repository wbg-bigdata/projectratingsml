MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR A SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Honduras (CON) for SDR14.3 million
(US$20 million equivalent) is submitted for your approval. The proposed
credit would be repayable on standard IDA terms with thirty-five years
maturity, including ten years of grace, and would help finance a Social
Investment Fund Project. The project would be cofinanced with other donors
for SDR23.1 million (US$33.0 million equivalent).
2.          Backtround.  Since March 1990, the Government has been taking
bold economic measures i:c!uding devaluation of the currency, an important
tariff reform, and fiscal measures to reduce the budget deficit. This
adjustment program will ultimately increase growth, employment, and incomes,
but it is having high social costs in the short run. As expected, there have
been sharp increases in prices of basic foods, transport and other services,
and many people have lost their jobs or are underemployed. The lose of jobs
resulting from the stabilization and adjustment process would range between
26,000 and 52,000, as the adj tment measures take their toll not only in the
public sector, but also in protected industries, construction, and other
sectors which employ mostly blue-collar workers. Real wages and incomes of
the urban poor and net buyers of food in rural areas are being reduced
substantially and those who belong to the traditional poverty group are being
more acutely affected by the adjustment program. This trend is going to
continue for some time as additional economic measures are taken. If the
adjustment program is to be successful and accepted by the population, the
social costs of adjustment need to be mitigated.
3.          Such action is especially important in Honduras where there is
already a high degree of poverty. The GNP per capita of US$481, estimated for
1990 by the Bank, is higher only than that of Bolivia, Haiti and Nicaragua
among the Latin American countries. Extreme poverty affects over 502 of the
population nationally and nearly 801 of the rural population. At the same
time, nutrition indicators remain among the worst in the Western Hemisphere,
with malnutrition rates for children of less than 5 years varying between 55Z
and 711 in the poorest regions. As a result of the economic adjustment,
malnutrition and child mortality will probably increase.
4.          Service delivery by the Ministries of Health and Education (MON
and MOR) is inadequate. Honduras has not neglected the social sectors in
terms of relative spending levels which, at 6.8Z of GDP, compare favorably to
other countries in the region. However, the health and education sectors have
been managed inefficiently with: (i) a serious drop in investment and
maintenance expenditures, (ii) an excessive proportion of the MOE and MOR
budgets going to salaries, and (iii) rapidly rising administrative costs. The
MOH covers only about 601 of the target population in primary health care, and
322 of the adult population were illiterate in 1988. This situation is
expected to worsen during the economic adjustment period. School attendance
will decline because families will tend to withdraw primary school children
from school to put them to work. In addition, the school and health
infrastructure will deteriorate because of tighter budgets, especially in



-t -
rural areas, where schools and health services are already in a very poor
shape and there is a significant shortage of materials and supplies.
5.          Recognizing the lack of capacity of the social ministries to
address tho longtenrm issues of health 4ad education officiently and
equitably, the Government has requested the Bank's support to improve service
delivery of tho NO and MOE under a proposed social sector restructuring
operation. In the meantime, to cushion the adverse social offects of its
adjustment program, the Government has created, in March 1990, the Honduran
Social Investment Fund (MRIS) under legislation allowing the 4nstitution to
operate flexibly and efficiently. The PHIS is broadly modelled after the
successful Bolivia Emergency Social Fund (ESP). Its dynamic and well-
respected Executive Director comes from the private sector and has the rank of
Minister. There have been consistent Government efforts to msake the MIS as
professional an institution as possible with an independent Executive
Director, a well-balanced Board, a high quality staff, and the close vigilance
by foreign donors.
6.          The mS combines an emergency employment strategy with the
objective of poverty alleviation through the provision of financing for: (i)
social infrastructure projects such as rehabilitation of health posts,
schools, water and sewerage systems, and emergency employment programs, (ii)
projects in health, nutrition, and education targeted to the most vulnerable
groups: mothers and young children, and (iii) informal sector projects. The
MRIS has a limited life of three years. It is clearly seen by both the
government and by donors as an instrument to complement and not compete with
the line ministries who have serious capacity limitations and are not
currently in a position to respond quickly to an emrgency situation nor to
long-term sectoral issues. The Government has given strong support to the
MIS through an initial budget allocation of US$6.0 million in early 1990.
This has given a clear signal to the Honduran population and to potential
donors about the Government's commitment to poverty alleviation.  The mS has
also received the financial support of USAID and UNDP, but it will need
significant additional external financing to undertake its three-year program.
During its first ten months of operations, the IHIS approved 1,113 projects
totalling US$6.9 million. For 1991, IRIS has already a pipeline of
subprojects requiring US$15.0 million, which is estimated to be half of the
total subproject costs expected for the year. The IRIS ia not an executing,
but a financing agency. Subprojects are executed by decentralized entities
such as private local contractors, NGOs, municipalities, or other public
agencies. So far, FHIS' operational procedures and practice have been sound,
although they would be strengthened further under the proposed project. The
mS will be audited by private external independent auditors, acceptable to
the Association, who will undertake a quarterly audit combining financial
review, physical inspection of works, and verification of procurement for
subprojects.
7.          PIRS-financed subprojects are clearly targeted to the poor.
First, wages paid under subprojects are for heavy and unskilled labor and,
therefore, mainly the poor will be employed. In addition, more funds are
programed for those departments and municipalities that have the worst
poverty indicators, and the mS will undertake more promotional activities in
these areas.  The mS has ranked departments and municipalities according to



- 3 ,
indices of poverty: i.e., child malnutrition, and access to potable water and
sewerage services.
8.          Cost recovery is one of the important oubproject selection
criteria and takes diatinct forms depending on the type of subproject. In the
case of social infrastructure, local committees are set up to recover
sufficient funds from water rates, betterment taxes and voluntary
contributions to cover the costs of operation, maintenance, and occasional
repairs of water and sanitation systems as well as access roads.   In the case
of basic needs subprojects (health, nutrition and education), fees would be
charged for those services or items where this is legally permitteds for
example, modest fees for medicines to replenish stocks. For informal sector
subprojects, final beneficiaries will pay the market interest rate.
9.          Many of the poor suffering from the hardship of economic
adjustment will be helped through the programs of the PHTS, but still a
significant number of persons will remain acutely vulnerable. Because of
their reduced purchasing power, their nutrition level or even their lives will
be at stake. This is especially true for pregnant and lactating women and
children under five years old. In March 1990, in order to supplement the food
distribution program for the poor, the Government introduced a food coupon
system for single mothers and children under five years old. While well-
intentioned, the program has run into management and logistical difficulties.
Through the Regional Unit of Technical Assistance (RUTA), the Association and
UNDP have been providing technical assistance to the Government to improve the
design and broaden the targeting of the nutrition assistance program. The
revised program would benefit all mothers, not just single mothers, and
children under five and would be implemented through the existing structure of
the health service system.
10.         Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  Recognizing the efforts of
the Honduran Government to undertske a bold program of economic reform, the
Bank Group has approved a Second Structural Adjustment Loan in September 1990
and a supplemental Structural Adjustment Credit in January 1991. While, in
the long term, the structural reforms of this program will help alleviate
poverty, in the short term it will have negative social effects. This
proposed project is designed to address these negative short-term effects of
the Government's restructuring program supported by SAL II and to provide the
basis for a long-term program which would lead to a more equitable and
efficient provision of social services (pars. 12). The Bank Group can also be
helpful in transferring the experience acquired in the social sectors of
Bolivia, Jamaica, and other countries, where the Bank Group financed similar
operations. In addition, by chairing the Consultative Group for Honduras, the
Bank Group is in a unique position to mobilize external grant or soft loan
funds to help the government alleviate the impact of the economic reform
program and initiate broader social sector reform.
11.         Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are
to support part of the Government's social program to: (i) mitigate the social
costs of adjustment and allow economic reform measures to be put into place
rapidly and made acceptable to the population, (ii) lay the basis for a
program of direct support for the poor and malnourished to buy food, and (iii)
support the improvement of service delivery in the social ministries.



- 4 .
12.         Pro1ect DescDlition.  The project would have four componentst (i)
the financing of PHIS programs (more than 952 of total project cost), (ii)
support to a pilot targeted nutrition assistance program (the executing agency
vould be the Family Assistance Program: PRAP), (iii) technical assistance to
help design a program to improve the efficisacy and equity of the services of
MOH and MOE, and (iv) the setting up of a monitoring and evaluation system of
the government'e social policy interventions through the use of a living
standards measurement study (the coordinator of this program would be the
Ministry of Planningt SECPLAN).
13.         The proceeds of the Credit would be lent to the Republic of
Honduras, which would pass on SDR13.9 million equivalent as a grant to the
PHIS. The PHIS, in turn, would use the Credit, in conjunction with funds from
other in ernational donors and the National Treasury, to finance, on a grant
basis, sub-projects in local communities, implemented by private contractors,
NGOs, and public agencies under the technical supervision of appropriate
agencies. The Borrower would make available the balance of SDR 0.4 million
equivalent to the respective institutions (PRAP and SECPLAN) in charge of
implementing components (ii) - (iv) of the project.
14.         The project would be implemented over a period of about three
years. The project cost is estimated at US$68.0 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$17.2 million (25 percent). The proposed IDA Credit
of SDR14.3 million (US$20.0 million equivalent) would represent about 291 of
total project costs. As shown in the Pinancing Plan presented in Schedule A,
beneficiaries are expected to finance 10 of project costs and the Borrower
would put up US$8.0 million or 122. The Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany has indicated that it intends to contribute US$12.0 million on highly
concessional terms, subject to a satisfactory appraisal of the project by KfW;
USAI.D would participate with US$8.0 million; the Government of the
Netherlands, US$2.1 mil.i.on in a joint financing with UNDP; sad UNDP by itself
would provide US$0.6 million. Other funds totalling US$1.8 million have been
approved by UNICEF, European donors, CIDA, and Japan. This would leave a
financing gap of US$8.5 million, which is expected to be filled through
resources mobilized from other donors on concessional terms. Should this gap
not be filled, the project size would be adjusted accordingly through a
reduction in the number of subprojects financed by F3IS. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9148-HO, dated February 6, 1991 is also
attached.
15.         Actions Agreed.  During netotiations, agreements were reached as
follows: (a) the Borrower would provide funds as indicated in the project
financing plan and as needed to cover the operating costs of the PHIS; (b) the
Borrower will have entered, by June 30, 1991, into loan agreements with other
financiers, providing the IHIS with a total financing of US$10.7 million
equivalent and that such agreements would be effective by that date; (c)
quarterly and annual audits would be carried out by external auditors on the
basis of acceptable sets of accounts; (d) experience and qualifications of
IHIS Executive Director would be acceptable to IDA and any future appointment
for that position would be subject to prior IDA consultation; (e) the Borrower



-5-
would carry out a mid-term review of the mS, would discuss the results with
the Association, and would implement actions agreed upon as a result of this
review; and (f) retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million would be allowed
in respect of eligible expendituree incurred since November 1, 1990.
16.         The conditions of effectfive_ess would bet (a) completion and
application of operational manual of the MIS, satisfactory to IDA; (b)
agreement for making the IDA funds available to the PHIS, and arrangements for
the same purpose with PRAF and SECPLAN; and (c) an additional funding
agreement of US$12.0 million equivalent minimum between the mS and KfW (or
alternative f4ancing arrangements for an equivalent amount with other donors)
and receipt by MIS of formal commitments of cofinancing, satisfactory to IDA,
totalling US$10.7 million equivalent from other financiers.
17.         Benefits.  By transferring resources to poor urban and rural
communities, the PHIS would help tot (i) create employment and income largely
among those who would have otherwise been underemployed or unemployed as a
result of the economic adjustment program, (Ui) improve the social
infrastructure so that the beneficiaries enjoy better sanitation, lower
transport costs, less erosion damage, etc., (iii) reduce the rates of
mortality, malnutrition, and illiteracy, particularly among women and
children, and (iv) provide the Government experience with a decentralized
mechanism for delivering social services. By supporting a pilot food coupon
program, the project would ensure an appropriate design while limiting
possibilities of errors to a small scale, and would lay the basis for a
broader nutrition program.
18.         Risks.  There is a risk that the Government may respond to the
social cost of adjustments with excessive speed, and project funds might be
poorly used and diverted to uses not envisaged in the project. This risk
would be reduced substantially through a good information system, quarterly
audits (both financial and physical) of a significant sample of subprojects,
and close supervision. There are also risks associated with the food coupon
program as poor design and targeting may result in waste of resources and
affect the Government's image. For this reason, it is proposed to start with
a pilot operation which can identify and solve logistical problems on a small
scale.
19.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of IDA and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Credit.
