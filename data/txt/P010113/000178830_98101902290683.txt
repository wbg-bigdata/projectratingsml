CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
On May 24, 19769 the Sri Lankan Rupee was officially linked
to a basket of currencies with the initial parity rate based
on the Rupee/Pound rate at that date. Both the composition
of the basket and the weights assigned to the currencies in
it were revised on March 12, 1977. The current Rupee/US
Dollar rate has been used throughout the report, except where
stated to the contrary:
US$1    =    Rs 7.28
Rs 1         US$0o 137
Rs 1 M       US$137,363
Most non-foodgrain imports have to pay a surcharge of 65%
through the purchase of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certifi-
cates (FEECs), and most non-traditional exports receive a 65%
premium over the official rate through the sale of FEECso
Inward remittances of foreign private investment and repatri-
ation of dividends or interest in such an investment are,
under existing policy, also convertible at the FEEC rate. The
premium is now fixed at 65% of the Rupee parity rate, result-
ing in the following current exchange rates including FEECs:
US$1    =    Rs 12001
Rs 1    =    US$00083

REPORT AND RECOIIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF THE ASSOCIATION
AND TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CORPORATION
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT BY THE ASSOCIATION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
ON A FOURTH DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON PROJECT
AND ON AN INVESTMENT BY THE CORPORATION
IN THE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the equivalent of US$8.0 million on
standard IDA terms, to help meet the estimated foreign exchange requirements
of the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) over the next two
years for lending to private sector industrial and tourism projects, and on
a proposed equity investment by the Corporation of about US$199,000 equiv-
alent. 1/ The proceeds of the credit would be relent to DFCC at 8.0% per
annum with repayment over a period of up to 18 years, on the basis of a
flexible amortization schedule reflecting the repayment terms of the sub-
loans made by DFCC.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Sri Lanka:    Country Economic Memorandum"
(Report No. 1425-CE, February 28, 1977) was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors on March 1, 1977. Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Sri Lanka's economic performance in recent years has been character-
ized by a moderate rate of growth of gross national product and an impressive
attempt to establish welfare programs providing goods and services either free
or at lost cost. Over the past decade (1966-76), economic growthi has averaged
3.9% per annum. With population growing at 2.0% per annum, real per capita
GNP has been rising at 1.9% per annum. While the second half of the past
decade has seen a deceleration in growth of population (1.6% per annum),
GNP growth slowed down more sharply (to 3.0% per annum) so that per annum
growth in per capita GNP fell to 1.4%. The deceleration in economic growth
is attributable to four factors. First, performance in the agricultural sec-
tor has been sluggish. Persistent drought conditions have plagued both field
and tree crops. Despite considerable 'government efforts to stimulate food-
grains production, output has remained well below domestic requirements,
necessitating heavy reliance on imports of rice and wheat flour. Second,
industrial activity has been depressed, reflecting declining levels of public
and private investment, shortages of domestic and imported raw materials and
deficiencies in management in an expanding public sector. Third, Sri Lanka's
1/   IFC proposes to subscribe to up to 23,861 DFCC common shares at the
price of par Rs 100 each. The exact dollar equivalent of the
Rs 2,386,100 would depend on exchange rates prevailing at the time
of IFC's investment.



- 2 -
terms of trade, which have been declining steadily since the mid-fifties,
worsened sharply after 1972 following increases in imported foodgrains,
fertilizer and petroleum prices. This put enormous pressure on the balance
of payments until the terms of trade swung back in Sri Lanka's favor in the
second half of 1976. Finally, the emphasis on welfare policies has contri-
buted to a marked rise in the share of consumption in gross national product
with a corresponding decline in the levels of savings and investment.
4.        Sri Lanka's achievements in the social field have been impressive.
This reflects the pursuit by successive governments over the past quarter
century of two policy goals: the supply of wage goods, principally food and
textiles, at low prices; and the provision of public services, mainly educa-
tion, health and transport, free of charge or substantially below cost. In-
come distribution data, relating to 1973, suggest that income in Sri Lanka
is more evenly distributed than in many developing countries. Food subsidies
cover the entire population, and health and education are provided at virtually
no cost by the state. An effective family planning program, the relatively
good health standards of the population and high literacy levels have contri-
buted to the decline in birth rates, while good medical care has contributed
to the low death rates. The fall in birth rates, together with repatriation
of Indian immigrants, accounts for the slackening in the population growth rate
noted in paragraph 3 above. These gains, however, must be set against a
serious and growing unemployment problem.    Open unemployment is esvuLaLed at
20%; a high proportion of the unemployed are educated to secondary school level
or above.
5.        Gross national product, adjusted for thie improvement recorded in
the terms of trade, expanded by 4.0% in 1976, as against 0.8% in 1975.
Severe drought conditions caused a decline in value added in agriculture,
and paddy production remained well below peak output levels realized in 1970
and 1974. Over the past several years, the basis has been established for
a substantial rise in paddy production by improvements in irrigation works,
institutions, pricing, seed varieties, fertilizer availability, and rural
roads. With good weather conditions, Sri Lanka now has the productive poten-
tial to meet at least three-quarters of its rice requirements. Results have
so far been poor, however, though prospects for 1977 are good (para. 10).
6.        Tree crop production in aggregate declined in 1976, as severe drought
affected production of tea and coconuts, and the sector as a whole suffered
from post-nationalization uncertainties. Among the sector's major problems
are the fragmentation of management arrangements after takeover and the related
poor management conditions on a substantial number of estates, especially those
run by cooperatives. A large proportion of the tea acreage (45%) and two-
thirds of output is accounted for by two major public sector corporations, the
State Plantation Corporation and Janawasama, and a further 15% of the acreage
is under cooperatives (Janawasas). The management problems of the estates for
all tree crops are aggravated by the backlog of maintenance and investment by
previous owners anticipating nationalization. The rise in export prices,
however, has greatly eased the post-nationalization problems of the estates.
Despite rising prices in 1976, all three major tree crops experienced a sharp
fall in replanting rates. However, tea replanting rates have been falling



since 1971. With only 12% of the area under tea replanted, the long run
production potential is not being increased adequately. Although 60% of the
area under rubber has been replanted, replanting rates remain well below
requirements.
7.        The real value of industrial output rose by 1.2% in 1976, with the
increase in output mainly in the public sector. This stagnation reflected
the fall in tea and coconut processing activity. Although private sector
investment activity as a whole has been slack, there has been an impressive
expansion of industrial exports in recent years. Industrial exports taken
together with other non-traditional exports, such as gems, now account for 30%
of Sri Lanka's exports as against 12% in 1970. The DFCC IV credit addresses
the problem of expanding export-oriented capacity to enable this growth to be
sustained. The previous Government's somewhat ambivalent attitude to the
private sector, which had been responsible for an unattractive investment
climate, changed somewhat after the 1976 budget when the Government announced
it would undertake a determined effort to improve private investment. The
recently elected Government has yet to define its policies.
8.        The Government's budgetary position deteriorated considerably in
1976, with the overall deficit amounting to 12% of GNP. The growth in the
deficit reflects the unresponsiveness of tax revenues to economic growth and
an inability to control current expenditures as a result of rising food subsi-
dies and transfers to loss-making public corporations. The deficits were
financed largely by borrowings from the banking system.    This, together with
the increase in net foreign assets, contributed to a 33% expansion in domestic
liquidity in 1976, as against a 5% expansion in 1975. Prices, therefore,
remain under pressure. Although the Colombo consumer price index rose by just
over 1% in 1976, the underlying rate of inflation, taking into account free
market prices, is estimated by the Sri Lankan Government at 10% in 1976.
9.        Sri Lanka's terms of trade in 1976 rose markedly from an all time
low of 46 in 1975 to 62 in 1976, thus reversing a steady decline which began
in the mid-1950s. The improvement was on account of higher prices for tree
crop exports, particularly rubber and tea, and low prices for imports of food
and textiles. However, because of supply constraints, export volumes were
lower for all three tree crops, and hence for exports as a whole. Export
earnings, therefore, showed no growth over 1975. Import payments, however,
fell sharply, due mainly to lower food prices. This caused the current account
deficit to fall from $186 million in 1975 to $64 million in 1976. A high
level of capital inflows caused international reserves to rise for the first
time since 1973.
10.       Sri Lanka's economic performance is likely to improve in 1977.
Agricultural production is expected to increase considerably. The paddy
crop could exceed 80 million bushels, a 33% increase over 1976. Tea and rubber
production is also expected to rise in 1977. As a result of record commodity
prices, particularly of tea and rubber, export earnings are expected to in-
crease by over 40%. This development encouraged the Government to revalue



- 4 -
the rupee by an average of 20% against major currencies on March 12, 1977, in
order to translate what it considered to be excessive windfall profits to the
producers of these commodities into benefits to the consumer in the form of
lower prices for imports. The impact of the revaluation on the demand for
funds from private investors, particularly in non-traditional exports, has
been carefully reviewed, and the amount of the credit has been adjusted to
take into account the possible adverse impact. The impact will vary from
industry to industry. While the adverse effect of the revaluation will be
undoubtedly cushioned partly by the current high profit margins in some key
industries such as garments, it is difficult to reconcile the revaluation with
the long-term developmental needs of an economy that has suffered from inade-
quate savings to finance investment, that must continue to diversify its
exports and that demands continuing attention to the adequacy of incentives
to agricultural production. In this area, as in others, the resolution of
the conflicts between short-term benefits to the consumer and the long-term
needs of the economy, remains urgent.
11.       At the thirteenth meeting of the Aid Group for Sri Lanka, held in
Washington in April 1977, the members welcomed the improvement in Sri Lanka's
terms of trade and emphasized the opportunity this presented to pursue a
much-needed program to increase savings and investment and raise the rate of
economic growth. They also expressed concern that recent policy measures may
make more difficult the task of reconciling the competing claims on resources
of Sri Lanka's social aspirations and need for more rapid economic growth.
The members indicated their intention to contribute aid of about $250 million,
which was considerably higher than aid indications in 1976. However, actual
new commitments by the Aid Group in 1976 at $120 million were considerably
below the indications of $180 million at the 1976 meeting. Aid disbursements
from all sources in 1976 totaled $149 million as against $202 million in 1975.
12.       Sri Lanka's dependence on foreign capital has risen sharply since
1973. Although concessional aid flows have risen significantly, they were
supplemented by a sizeable increase in short and medium-term borrowing. This
was responsible for the marked deterioration in the debt service ratio from
12% in 1974 to 20% in 1975 and 1976. However, the expected rise in export
earnings in 1977 is likely to cause a significant fall in the debt service
ratio.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
13.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has made eight loans totalling $73.4 million (net of cancellations) and
twelve credits totalling $112.3 million (net of cancellations and exchange
adjuBtments) in support of 18 projects. About 30% of Bank Group assistance
has been for power, 50% for agriculture (irrigation and agricultural and
dairy development), and the remainder for Development Finance Company opera-
tions, highways, a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials
for industry), and water supply. Three early power loans, the Mahaweli Ganga
Development credit, and the program credit were satisfactorily completed and



- 5 -
fully disbursed. Of the two DFCC loans, $6.8 million of the $12.0 million
available was cancelled by DFCC due to a sudden deterioration in the private
investment climate resulting from a change of governments in 1970. At the
request of the Borrower, a loan/credit for highways was cancelled in 1970,
after disbursement of $0.8 million of the credit, following the Government's
decision to make major changes in the scope of the project. The IFC's only
investment in Sri Lanka, $3.25 million to the Pearl Textile Mills, Ltd.
(Ceylon), was approved by IFC's Board of Directors in January, 1970, but
cancelled the same year because Government approval for the project was
withdrawn. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations
as of July 31, 1977, together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       The Bank Group's current strategy is focussed on the agricultural
sector to support Government efforts to increase food production and reduce
its dependence on rice/flour imports, and to improve productivity in the
tree crops subsector. Projects to support industry and basic infrastructure
are also included. A proposed project for diversification of crops on mar-
ginal lands now under tea and rubber is being prepared by the Government
together with an FAO/UNDP team with IDA assistance. Preparation is also
underway on an integrated rural development project for the Kurunegala
District and on a tree crop rehabilitation project aimed at maintaining
quantity and quality of Sri Lankan tea output as some tea lands are diverted
to other uses. In addition, projects in other fields, including irrigation
and drainage and dry farming, are being prepared for possible IDA financing.
15.       The Bank Group presently accounts for nearly 13% (Bank 5%; IDA 8%)
of Sri Lanka's total external debt outstanding, and about 5% (almost totally
Bank) of debt service. It is projected that the Bank Group's share in total
external debt will decline to about 9% by 1980 (with the Bank's share declin-
ing to about 2%). The Bank and IDA shares in the debt service will also show
a slight decline.
PART III - INDUSTRY AND TOURISM IN SRI LANKA
16.       The industrial sector in Sri Lanka accounts for about 13% of GDP and
provides employment for about 350,000-400,000 people, or 10% of total employ-
ment. While around 70% of the total industrial workforce is employed by a
large number (perhaps 35,000-50,000) of small, mostly non-corporate units
(cottage industry), the organized sector employs about 110,000 people, yet
accounts for 70% of total value added in manufacturing. The majority of
units in the organized sector are also small; in 1975, 900 out of approxi-
mately 1,500 units had output of less than Rs 250,000. Nevertheless, com-
panies with output of more than Rs 2 million account for 85% of production
in the private sector. Industry in Sri Lanka primarily consists of consumer
goods; the largest sub-sectors are food and beverages (50% of industrial
value-added), chemicals, plastics and petroleum (16%), and textiles and gar-
ments (14%). The public sector corporations account for about 50% of total
production in the organized manufacturing sector.



- 6 -
17.       In constant prices, the output from the organized manufacturing sec-
tor increased by 2.3% in 1974 and 15.5% in 1975. In the latter year, growth
came largely from the private sector with the production of the public sector
corporations growing by only 1%. By industry (public and private), the growth
was highest for textiles, garments and leather (51% in constant prices),
paper and paper products (32%), and food and beverages (29%). As a result of
this growth in production, total industrial employment in the organized sector
increased by 12%, while private sector employment alone grew by 17%. The
main reasons for this increase in production and employment are better use
and availability of domestic raw materials, and higher foreign exchange
allocations for imported raw materials.
18.       Excess industrial capacity is a serious problem in Sri Lanka among
local market industries, but it varies widely in importance among industries
and firms. Growth in production in 1975 was accompanied by an improvement
in capacity utilization, from 40% in 1974 to 54% in 1975. This is still low,
however, and is primarily due to the shortage of foreign exchange to pay for
the import of spare parts and raw materials, coupled with the small size
of the domestic market resulting from the inability of many consumers to
afford the goods produced.
19.       From a very low base, industrial exports (excluding petroleum prod-
ucts) have been expanding rapidly since 1972, growing from $9 million to $39
million in 1976 (in current prices). Private sector exports accounted for
about 70% of non-petroleum exports in 1973 and 1975, though somewhat less in
1974 due to high public sector exports of cement in that year. The improve-
ment in exports reflects the Government's incentives for export-oriented
industries and the relatively easy access to imported raw materials for these
industries.
20.       The tourism sector in Sri Lanka has achieved rapid growth since the
early and mid-sixties. The number of arrivals (business and pleasure) in-
creased from 19,000 in 1966 to 78,000 in 1973. Despite the general drop in
world travel in 1974, the number of arrivals increased by 9% to 85,000, and
increased further to 103,000 in 1975 and 119,000 in 1976. The Ceylon Tourist
Board expects the number of arrivals to continue to grow to reach 166,000 in
1978, which is attainable. From 1971 to August 1976, the number of rooms in
graded establishments grew from 2,055 to 4,220. The increase in capacity was
especially large in the latter two years, causing the average recorded room
occupancy to fall from 42.2% in 1973 to 36.8% in 1975. Due to the seasonality
of the traffic, the maximum average annual room occupancy for Sri Lanka is
considered to be around 55%. However, there are wide regional discrepancies
and many established hotels have been enjoying higher than average occupancy
rates. It is expected that these rates will now improve, since capacity is
expected to increase at a less rapid pace than the traffic.
21.       The previous Government's basic industrial development policies
placed primary emphasis on export-oriented and labor-intensive projects, and
on those minimizing foreign exchange requirements for capital goods and raw
materials. Additional Government goals were equalization of the distribution
of income and wealth and continued Government control over the private sector.

Consequently, immediately after coming to power in 1970, the previous Govern-
ment announced that the heavy and capital goods industries and other suitable
basic industries would be state-owned, while other industries would be assigned
to cooperatives and private enterprises. Further, the "Business Undertakings
(Acquisition) Act" was passed in 1971, under which the Government is empowered
to take over any private firm at its discretion. As a result of such pro-
nouncements and other measures, private sector confidence was severely shaken
and investments declined sharply. However, in practice not many enterprises
were taken over, and the Government's policy of maintaining or introducing
various incentives indicated a recognition of the role of the private sector.
As a result, private sector investment interest gradually improved. The 1976
budget placed increased emphasis on the role of the private sector, although
not all measures promised were introduced. The 1977 budget speech contained
no major changes for the private sector except the Government's intention to
nationalize the three privately held foreign banks. This did not materialize,
however. The new Government's policies towards the private sector have not
yet been formalized.
22.       Private sector companies rely to a considerable extent on self-
financing for industrial development, supplemented by long-term funds from DFCC
and the commercial banks. In December 1975, total industrial loans outstand-
ing of more than five years from the commercial banks (excluding rollover of
short-term credits) were Rs 66 million, compared to Rs 94 million in loans
and investments outstanding from DFCC as of March 1976, almost all of which
were for private enterprises. This makes DFCC the leading industrial term
lending institution in Sri Lanka, and it is also the only institution provid-
ing foreign exchange for industrial investment in the private sector. Public
sector corporations normally obtain their requirements directly from the
Government.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The proposed project was appraised in August/September 1976.    A re-
port entitled "Sri Lanka - Appraisal of a Fourth Development Finance Corpora-
tion of Ceylon Project" (No. 1388A-CE of August 24, 1977) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington,
from June 27 to July 1, 1977. The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. A.
Mohamed, Additional Director of External Resources, External Resources Divi-
sion, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs. A credit and project summary
prefaces this report.
History and Past Operations
24.       DFCC was established in 1955 by an Act of Parliament to finance
private enterprises (defined as enterprises in which Government ownership
does not exceed 20%) in industry, agriculture and commerce, including hotels,
transportation and construction. It does not finance enterprises engaged
solely in trading activities. DFCC was established in response to recommen-
dations of an IBRD economic survey report published in 1952. In the early



years, it was felt that DFCC did not need Bank assistance and, for a period
of about four years from 1961, the country's economic policies precluded Bank
Group assistance. In the late sixties, IBRD made two loans to DFCC for $4
million and $8 million, respectively, part of which were cancelled when the
investment climate deteriorated and demand for funds proved to be less than
expected (para. 13). Improved investment interest from 1973 led to a third
DFCC project, Credit 566-CE for $4.5 million in 1975, to be utilized primarily
for export-oriented industry and tourism. Of this credit to date, subprojects
for $4.0 million have been approved and $2.9 million disbursed (Annex II).
25.       DFCC's net commitments of loans and investments averaged Rs 18
million in DFCC's fiscal years (April 1 to March 31) 1973 and 1974, dropped
to Rs 9 million in FY75 (due to continued political uncertainties and DFCC's
lack of foreign exchange resources in that year) and rose to Rs 43 million
in FY76. During FY76, foreign exchange loans and investments were 38% of
total net commitments and accounted for about 20% of the total outstanding
portfolio. Tourism projects account for 35% of DFCC's total outstanding
portfolio. This share may increase somewhat as present commitments are dis-
bursed, but is thereafter expected to decline. Other significant sectors in
the portfolio are textiles, engineering, and food processing industries, but
none of these account for more than 10% of the total portfolio. Except for
its relatively high exposure in tourism, DFCC's portfolio is well diversified.
26.       DFCC's operations are heavily concentrated in the medium-scale sec-
tor of Sri Lanka; in FY76, 80% of approvals of loans and investments by number
(62% by amount) went to clients with fixed assets of less than Rs 10 million
($0.8 million equivalent). Small-scale industries (SSIs) in Sri Lanka are now
defined as enterprises with less than Rs 500,000 (about $42,000 equivalent) of
investment in machinery and equipment. DFCC has done little lending to SSIs,
since the commercial banks are better placed for SSI lending in view of their
branch network, working capital lending, and other banking services. Under
Credit 566-CE, $200,000 was earmarked for lending to SSIs, of which about
$107,000 has been utilized to date. With a view to increasing its lending
to the small-scale sector, DFCC has entered into a scheme with the Industrial
Development Board (IDB) and the two largest commercial banks, the People's
Bank and Bank of Ceylon (Section 2.10 of the draft Project Agreement).
Applications under the scheme will be received and processed by IDB and one
or the other of the commercial banks. The IDB will provide technical assis-
tance to the clients while rupee financing will be provided by either of the
banks. Applications for foreign exchange will be submitted to DFCC which
normally will undertake only a desk review, based on simplified appraisal
requirements. DFCC's foreign exchange loans under the scheme will be guar-
anteed by the participating commercial bank. Under the proposed credit,
DFCC will be permitted to engage in refinancing for SSI units through the
commercial banks which would eliminate the need for the client to establish
loan documents with more than one institution. Details of the scheme, which
are acceptable to IDA, are included in Schedule 1 of the draft Project
Agreement.



-9-
Capital Structure and Resources
27.       DFCC's authorized share capital is Rs 24 million.     Its initial paid-
in share capital was Rs 7.1 million which was increased to Rs 8.0 million in
1967. DFCC's current ongoing capital increase of Rs 8.0 million will increase
its share capital to Rs 16.0 million. Of this, domestic sources have taken up
Rs 5.6 million and IFC proposes to invest in Rs 2.4 million in shares (paras.
41-44). More than Rs 3.0 million has already been paid in, with the balance
to be paid in two calls in 1978. DFCC's ownership is fairly broadly based by
local standards; after the share capital issue, the private sector will con-
trol 51%, foreign investors (including IFC) 30%, and the public sector 19%.
DFCC intends to continue to increase its share capital in the future in order
to maintain DFCC's debt-equity ratio within the contractual limit of 7:1, and
also to provide resources for its rupee lending. In FY76, a dividend of 9%
was declared, up from 8% for the previous years. The DFCC Act limits the
dividend to a maximum of 12%. Due to the low dividend, DFCC's shares are
quoted at about Rs 90 (par value is Rs 100). A higher dividend rate (up
towards the legal maximum) would have increased the market value of DFCC's
shares somewhat, but would not have substantially affected the response to
DFCC's recent share issue.
28.       Until recently, DFCC has depended exclusively on IBRD/IDA for its
foreign exchange resources. However, DFCC obtained approval in December 1976
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a $5 million loan. The ADB loan is
to the Government, for relending to DFCC at 8.9% per annum. It is a general
purpose loan, though it excludes lending for tourism, where ADB feels IDA
has more expertise, and for equity investments, in line with ADB general
policy. Ten percent of the loan is allocated for lending to small-scale in-
dustry. The Government will bear the exchange risk under the loan and there
is a minimum average spread of 3.75% on the ADB funds.
29.       Of DFCC's rupee resources as of June 30, 1976, equity accounted for
14%, provisions for 3%, a Government subordinated loan for 15%, Central
Bank refinancing for 34%, Bank of Ceylon credit facilities for 24%, and the
National Savings Bank for 10%. In addition to its recent capital increases
(para. 27), DFCC is also making other efforts to diversify its sources of rupee
funds by obtaining deposits of "blocked funds" (funds owned by residents of
foreign countries) and, possibly, funds from the Ceylon Insurance Corporation
or via debentures. DFCC's domestic resources position is expected to remain
comfortable.
Institutional Aspects
30.       DFCC is well managed, and despite an increasing Government role in
the economy, it has preserved its operational autonomy. The present Chairman
has taken a keen interest in day-to-day operations, giving DFCC a more dynamic
attitude, and the General Manager is an experienced banker. DFCC's organiza-
tional structure is appropriate, consisting of five departments with clearly
defined responsibilities. Its professional staff was increased by 50% from
September 1974 to September 1975 and remained almost constant at 20 until



- 10 -
recently when eight additional officers were recruited. This should satisfy
most of DFCC's staff requirements for the near future. The staff is of good
quality.
Operating Policies and Procedures
31.       DFCC's appraisal and follow-up standards are generally good.     For
most projects, DFCC is now calculating the economic rate of return and the
domestic resource cost per unit of foreign exchange earned/saved. DFCC will
make more use of economic calculations in project analysis, and will also
pay more attention to capacity utilization questions. DFCC tries to visit
projects under construction every quarter, projects in operation once a year,
and problem projects as and when necessary. Because of staff constraints,
DFCC has not been able, in the past, to fulfill this schedule, but should be
able to do so now with the addition of three project implementation officers
recently recruited. DFCC generally requires that procurement under its foreign
currency loans be based on three quotations from foreign suppliers; for rupee
loans, DFCC tries to obtain alternative quotations wherever possible. DFCC's
procurement and disbursement policies are satisfactory.
32.       Over the past two years, DFCC's normal local currency lending rate
has gone up from 10.5% to 12.0%. DFCC's normal foreign currency lending rate
is 12.5% which would be increased to 13% under the proposed credit. This
would give DFCC a spread of 5% which is not excessive in view of the need
for it to build up its equity.
33.       By amount, 82% of DFCC's gross approvals in FY75, and 68% in FY76,
were for maturities of ten years or more. Although the average maturity of
loans has been reduced some in recent years, DFCC still has a tendency to
grant its clients somewhat long repayment periods. DFCC intends to reexamine
its repayment period policy. In investments, DFCC normally limits its hold-
ings in a single enterprise to 25% of that company's ordinary share capital
or 10% of DFCC's equity plus the outstanding amount of the subordinated
Government loan to DFCC, whichever is lower. At present, DFCC's aggregate
share investments are limited to the sum of its equity and the outstanding
amount of the subordinated Government loan. DFCC has suggested, and IDA has
agreed, that this may be changed so that the aggregate of DFCC's ordinary
and non-redeemable preference share investments may not exceed 50%, and the
aggregate of its redeemable preference share investments may not exceed 75%,
of this sum. DFCCGs total exposure in an individual company normally cannot
exceed 20% of the sum of its equity and the outstanding amount of the subor-
dinated Government loan. DFCC's exposure limits are reasonable.
Financial Position
34.       DFCC's profitability has improved gradually over the past few years
as a result of the increased level of activity and higher returns on equity
investments. Net profit increased from Rs 0.99 million in FY73 to Rs 1.24
million in FY75, or from 8.3% of average equity to 10%, respectively. FY76
profit increased to Rs 2.03 million, a return on equity of 15.2%, but the
improvement was in part due to the absence of a provision for doubtful loans



- 11 -
in that year.    DFCC's long-term debt:equity ratio was 5.4:1 as of March 1976,
against a contractual limit of 7.0:1 as set in Credit 566-CE (defined to
include the subordinated loan to the Government as debt rather than equity)
and maintained under the proposed credit (Section 3.05 of the draft Project
Agreement). This limit is appropriate for DFCC. The quality of DFCC's
investment portfolio is good, and the debt-service coverage ratio over the
past four years has remained satisfactory at between 1.2:1 and 1.7:1. DFCC's
accounts have always been approved without qualifications by DFCC's auditors,
and their long-term audit report is of good quality.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
35.       DFCC's development strategy for the next few years is a broad one.
In line with Government policies, DFCC will concentrate on projects which
maximize employment generation and on projects earning foreign exchange.
Other priority projects will be those utilizing local raw materials, balanc-
ing, replacement, and modernization projects, and finally, essential import
substitution projects. At the same time, DFCC will also endeavour to increase
its promotional activities. As a condition of credit effectiveness, DFCC's
Board will approve a Strategy Statement acceptable to IDA (Section 6.01(c) of
the draft Development Credit Agreement).
36.       As of June 1977, DFCC had received applications for foreign ex-
change financing of $14.0 million for 62 projects with a total foreign ex-
change requirement of $26.3 million. Much of the balance is expected to be
financed from such sources as foreign banks and collaborators, free foreign
exchange, convertible rupee accounts, and supplier's credits. In terms of the
amount of DFCC foreign exchange assistance, export-oriented industries account
for 40% of the pipeline, local market industries for 38%, tourism projects for
15%, and miscellaneous projects for 7%. By number, two-thirds of the export-
oriented projects are new, while about half of the local market projects are
new, and the others are for expansion, balancing, modernization, and replace-
ment. The question of utilization of existing capacity is not a problem for
export industries in Sri Lanka, but must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis
for local market industries. DFCC has agreed to strengthen its capacity uti-
lization analysis (para. 31), and the free limit is structured to permit IDA
closer contact with projects where capacity utilization could be a problem
(para. 38). DFCC's project list is far from definite, and it is likely that
a number of projects either will drop from the pipeline, or be rejected by
DFCC during appraisal. On the other hand, this is expected to be offset by
other projects coming forward during the commitment period of the proposed
credit (through December 1979). At present, DFCC has foreign exchange re-
sources available for commitment of $2.7 million; $0.5 million and $2.2
million yet to be committed from Credit 566-CE and the ADB loan, respectively.
As DFCC expects to have no other foreign exchange resources over the commit-
ment period of the proposed project, an IDA credit of $8.0 million would help
cover its estimated foreign exchange requirements through December 1979.
The Proposed Credit
37.       The proposed credit of $8.0 million would be used to meet up to
100% of the foreign exchange costs of capital goods and services imported for



- 12 -
projects financed by DFCC. Eligible enterprises would be broadly defined to
include manufacturing, agro-industries, tourism, mining and transportation,
among others.
38.       The credit would be made to the Government to be relent to DFCC
through a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association (Section 3.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
DFCC would pay the Government interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum with
repayment over a period of up to 18 years, on the basis of a flexible amorti-
zation schedule reflecting the repayment terms of the sub-loans made by DFCC.
DFCC would also pay to the Government a commitment fee of 0.75% on the undis-
bursed amounts, to be passed on to DFCC's sub-borrowers. As under the two
previous IBRD loans and one IDA credit to DFCC, the foreign exchange risk
would continue to be assumed by the Government. This is in view of the uncer-
tain foreign exchange situation and the small size of many of DFCC's clients.
The free limit (Section 2.03 (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement)
would be: (a) $100,000 for projects exporting less than 80% of their pro-
duction and which are also either new investment projects or existing invest-
ment projects involving an increase in installed capacity of at least 10%;
(b) $100,000 for all tourism projects; and (c) $400,000 for all other projects.
Project Benefits and Risks
39.       As DFCC is the leading industrial term lending institution in Sri
Lanka and the only institution providing foreign exchange for private invest-
ment, the proposed credit is expected to facilitate expansion of the private
industrial sector. The project is expected to contribute to mobilization of
domestic resources for investment and to generation of employment opportuni-
ties. In the past, DFCC's foreign exchange financing has generated about
2.7 times its rupee equivalent in local currency investments. Tentative
employment figures available for about 70% of the projects in the pipeline
show an expected creation of about 7,300 new jobs, with an estimated total
cost per job of $4,800 equivalent. In addition, the proposed credit would
reinforce DFCC in the important role it has been playing in the promotion
of investment in Sri Lanka through its contacts with businessmen and poten-
tial investors. These promotional activities would be expanded under the
project and DFCC expects to encourage actively foreign investment through
collaboration with local entrepreneurs. The proposed credit would also con-
tribute to further strengthening of DFCC as an institution through improvement
of appraisal standards.
40.       The primary risk associated with the proposed credit concerns the
private investment climate. A new Government was recently elected which has
yet to clarify its policies towards the private sector. A more restrictive
attitude, such as in the early 1970s, could bring a sharp decline in invest-
ment interest once again, but the chances of this do not seem great.



- 13 -
PART V - THE IFC INVESTMENT
41.       It is proposed that IFC subscribe for cash up to 23,861 ordinary
shares of DFCC of par value of Rs 100 each at the price of par for a total
investment of up to approximately US$199,000 equivalent, pursuant to a
Subscription Agreement to be entered into with DFCC. After completion of
the proposed share issue, IFC would hold up to 15% of DFCC's share capital.
The Government of Sri Lanka and DFCC's management attach great importance
to IFC's proposed investment and the latter has expressed the desire that
IFC be represented on DFCC's Board. IFC, through appropriate representa-
tion on the Board, could contribute significantly to DFCC's investment
policies and generally assure close relations between DFCC and the Bank
Group. I intend, therefore, to nominate a suitable person to represent
IFC on the Board of DFCC.
42.       The proposed IFC investment in DFCC would be the Corporation's
first in Sri Lanka since 1970 (para. 13). The potential financial return
on the IFC investment is modest, although share book value as of April 30,
1977, was Rs 171. Prior to FY76, DFCC's return on equity was 8-10%. An
increase to 15% in FY76 was achieved in part because no provision for doubt-
ful accounts was made in that year. Dividends are expected to continue in
the range of 8-9% of par and are limited by provisions of the DFCC Act to
12% of par. DFCC shares are quoted in local markets at Rs 90 per share and,
on the basis of current dividend expectations, have only limited appreciation
potential. IFC is prepared to proceed in order to support a developmental
institution and to establish relationships which will benefit the growth of
future IFC activities in Sri Lanka.
43.       The main conditions for payment by IFC of the subscription price
will be that repatriation and other rights, including the entitlement of
IFC's investment in DFCC to the preferential exchange rate under the Foreign
Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme be granted to IFC. Investment laws
of the Republic of Sri Lanka which are applicable to IFC's investment are
contained in Annex IV.
44.       Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit (DEG),
a West German Government-owned development institution, has been discussing
with the Government of Sri Lanka and DFCC an equity investment in DFCC. The
Sri Lankan Government has approved a total equity investment of up to 15% of
DFCC's share capital for IFC and DEG combined. DEG and DFCC have not yet
agreed on the amount and terms of DEG's investment. IFC is therefore pre-
pared to take up the entire 23,861 shares available for subscription and has
indicated to DFCC and DEG its willingness to subscribe to a lesser amount,
if an investment by DEG is agreed upon before the completion of IFC's sub-
scription. Alternatively, IFC would take up the entire 15% to complete
DFCC's share capital increase and would be prepared to sell a portion to DEG.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Sri
Lanka and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and DFCC, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Sec-
tion 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of two draft resolutions
approving the proposed credit and IFC investment, respectively, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. In accordance with Section
3 (ii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation, the
Government of the Republic of Sri Lanka has been notified of the proposed
investment.
46.       Special conditions of this credit are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
47.       Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf of the Borrower
and DFCC is a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
48.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and that the proposed investment
by the Corporation complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation.
49.       The Republic of Sri Lanka has signed the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes Convention. However, in the context of the
proposed investment, there are no arrangements between the Republic of Sri
Lanka and a private investor which might give rise to an investment dispute.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Association approve
the proposed credit and that the Board of Directors of the Corporation approve
the proposed investment on substantially the terms outlined above.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 121 - Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 million of June 19. 1968; Effec-
tive Date: August 5, 1968; Original Closing Date: June 30,
1973; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Construction of the project has been virtually completed, about
three years behind the appraisal schedule due to government change, reorgani-
zation, insurrection in 1971, strikes in 1972 and inadequate repair facilities.
Total costs have risen due to inflation by US$1.4 million over the appraisal
estimate of US$3.3 million; the overrun is being met from local sources.
The project remains viable because prices of the main outputs (onions and
chillies) have risen three to four times the values used for appraisal. Due
to delay in opening of letters of credit for items on which orders were
placed prior to the Closing Date, disbursements will be continued up to
December 31, 1977.
Ln. No. 636 - Maskeliya Oya Power Project; US$16.5 million of July 28, 1969;
Effective Date: January 19, 1970; Original Closing Date:
September 30. 1973; Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is virtually completed. The first unit of 50 MW was com-
missioned in February 1974, about 1-1/2 years later than originally estimated.
The second unit was commissioned in July 1974. The gas turbine unit was can-
celled upon the request of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Delays were
caused mainly by problems associated with the appointment of acceptable con-
sultants, landslides in the penstock area and various strikes in manufacturers'
factories. Site work has in general been carried out satisfactorily. The only
remaining work, the extension of the Polpitiya switching station, is expected
to be completed by Fall 1977. The Closing Date of the loan has been extended
to December 31, 1977, to allow for completion of the Polpitiya switching sta-
tion, and due to delays in manufacture and delivery of equipment. Foreign
exchange savings of about $1.7 million are to be used to cover the cost
overrun on the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Credit 372-CE),
discussed below.
Cr. No. 168 - Land Reclamation and Drainage Project; US$2.5 million of Novem-
ber 13, 1969; Effective Date: February 12, 1970; Original
Closing Date: December 31, 1974; Revised Closing Date: June
30, 1977
Construction in the initial years of implementation was behind
schedule for the same reasons as under Credit 121-CE above. Progress thereafter
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

was adequate, with the exception of the past year during which a shortage of
budget funds, nonavailability of cement, and a four-year delay in delivery of
gates ordered from a Government factory, have further delayed project comple-
tion by about one year. The remaining work, amounting to about 9% of total
project cost, is now expected to be completed by early 1978. The Revised
Closing Date will not be extended, but as the remaining works are essential
to realization of project benefits, disbursement will be allowed to continue
up to December 31, 1977. Overall project costs have increased due to infla-
tion by about 47% above the appraisal estimate; the cost overruns are being
met by the Government. The project remains viable because the price of the
main output (paddy) has increased by over 100% since appraisal. Project super-
vision will continue after the Credit is closed.
Ln. No. 653 - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project (Irrigation/Power); US$14.5
million of January 30, 1970; Effective Date: April 30, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976; Revised Closing Date: July 31,
1978
The project, now nearly complete, is nearly two years behind apprais-
al target. Delays were due mainly to foundation problems at Polgolla power
house and a slow start at Bowatenna diversion dam. After overcoming these
problems, the construction progressed satisfactorily. Water was diverted at
Polgolla in January, and at Bowatenna in MIarch, 1976. The power plant has been
tested and is operational. The Bowatenna and Elehara (diversion and new canal
intake) structures are almost completed.    The only work remaining to be comple-
ted is the invert lining of the Bowatenna Tunnel, which is scheduled for com-
pletion during the next tunnel closure in February/March 1978. Good progress
has been recorded to date on agricultural extension and research in the project
area. Total project costs increased by about 12% over the appraisal estimates,
largely as a result of rising costs for electromechanical equipment. However,
the economic viability of the project was not adversely affected by the cost
overruns since produce prices have increased by 100% since appraisal. The
Credit associated with this project (174-CE) has been fully disbursed. The
Closing Date of the Loan has been extended to July 31, 1978 to permit final
disbursements, including one year for disbursing retention payments.
Cr. No. 372 - Power Transmission and Distribution Project; US$6.0 million
of April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 25, 1973; Original
Closing Date: December 31, 1976; Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The project is proceeding without major problems. Procurement of
equipment and materials is practically completed. Route survey and right-of-
way acquisition are progressing satisfactorily.     Inflation since signing has
increased foreign exchange costs by some 30% and we have agreed to cover the
cost overruns from savings under Loan 636-CE above. Although actual physical
completion of the project will not be until 1979, disbursements from this
Credit and the US$1.7 million from Loan 636-CE, are expected to be completed
by the Revised Closing Date.

Cr. No. 504 - Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
The Project Technical Unit is working effectively and the new calf
rearing unit is in successful operation.    FarmersI response to the project
is most encouraging and participating banks for loan processing are working
well. However, shortage of local cattle and the high mortality (30% for
heifers and 60% for calves) in the first batch of imported cattle (86%), have
impeded progress. Plans are underway to improve local cattle availability
and reduce import mortality for the second cattle shipment (800 to 850) which
was approved by IDA in April 1977. Further cattle importation will be re-
examined based on the experiences of the second shipment. Milk collection
by the National Milk Board (NMB) has already reached full development targets.
However, NMB continues to incur losses which are made up by Government sub-
sidies to allow 8% return on capital. NMB's accounting system has improved,
enabling productwise subsidies to be identified, and the Government has re-
cently agreed to reduce the subsidy on butter and is considering the same
for condensed milk. NMB could considerably reduce its operating costs by
minor engineering changes, and the Government may seek IDA's assistance in
this field. Although disbursements are behind schedule, procurements are
now underway for NMB's equipment.
Cr. No. 566 - Third Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$4.5 million of June 27, 1975; Effective Date: August 22,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
The Credit was designed to meet the estimated foreign exchange re-
quirements of the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) over the
life of the project for lending mainly to export industries and tourism. The
implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily and there are no
major issues. To date, sub-projects for $4.0 million have been approved and
$2.9 million has been disbursed. The Credit is likely to be completed and
fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 595 - Agricultural Development Project; US$25.0 million of December
24, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976; Closing Date: June
30, 1978
The Credit will help meet capital and technical assistance require-
ments in the agricultural sector. Disbursements are behind schedule because
of delays in finalizing complementary UNDP projects, appointment by the Gov-
ernment of key consultants and inadequacies in local overall project coordina-
tion, but are improving. The irrigation and sugar production components are
now progressing satisfactorily. Tender documents for the remainder of these
two components are being finalized, and orders for the importation of the first
lot of machinery for the Ministry of Irrigation, Power, and Highways have been
placed. Orders have been placed for about 400 4-wheel tractors and orders



ANNEX II
Page 5
for about 200 more are expected to be placed shortly. Bids have been re-
ceived and are under evaluation for transportation equipment for the Ministry
of Plantation Industries. Agreement has been reached on modified UNDP comple-
mentary projects and final approval by UNDP and FAO (Executing Agency) has been
obtained. The Government has appointed the key consultants for the tree crop
incentive study which is now underway. Implementation of the project has
improved since the appointment of a project coordinator and with more frequent
meetings of the Project Coordinating Committee. The Credit is expected to be
fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
The first supervision mission took place in April/May 1977. The
inter-ministerial Project Coordinating Committee has been established and is
meeting regularly, and working committees at the district and tank levels are
being formed. The Chief Project Engineer has been appointed and has assumed
his duties. Procurement is in process for the equipment and vehicles to be
financed by both IDA and the United Kingdom, which is providing US$6.0 million
equivalent in co-financing. Nearing completion are the construction of field
offices and living quarters for the first two tanks, and the preparation of
the designs and plans for the initial modernization works. Construction of
these works will be initiated in early Fall 1977. The next supervision mis-
sion is scheduled for October 1977.
Cr. No. 701    Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; US$19.0 million of
April 21, 1977; Effective Date (planned): September 30, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
This credit will help finance a project for the construction of
irrigation works and settlement facilities, agricultural production sup-
port, and social infrastructure for about 106,000 acres located in the
north-central dry zone of Sri Lanka. Co-financing arrangements have been
made with Canada, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The first supervision mission took place in April/May 1977. The preparation
of specifications and tender documents for the equipment to be provided under
the project is well underway. The designs, specifications, and tender docu-
ments for civil works are being prepared by the Mahaweli Development Board,
and the construction is expected to begin in October. The next supervision
mission is scheduled for October 1977.
Cr. No. 709    Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of May 10, 1977; Effective
Date (planned): September 29, 1977; Closing Date: March 31,
1982
This credit will help finance: improvement of existing water
supplies to Colombo and five adjacent towns south of Colombo; and provision

of piped water to five adjacent towns north of Colombo and to two towns on
the Southwest Coast. The project will include provision for expenditures
on spare parts and equipment, technical assistance and training. An addi-
tional credit of Canadian $5.0 million, from Canadian funds administered by
IDA, will also assist in financing this project.

ANNEX IV
INVESTMENT LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
RELEVANT TO IFC INVESTMENT IN
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION OF CEYLON
There are no particular laws or decrees regulating foreign invest-
ment in enterprises in Sri Lanka although foreign exchange transactions are
regulated and the Government has published certain administrative guidelines
affecting foreign investment in tourism, fishing, manufacturing and other
industries. These guidelines are contained in a paper entitled "Policy of
the Government of Sri Lanka (Ceylon) on Private Foreign Investment" issued
in June 1972 by the Ministry of Planning and Employment. However, the guide-
lines of the policy paper are not applicable to foreign investments in solely
financial, trading or commercial enterprises, and IFC's proposed investment
would be in a financial enterprise. Therefore, it will be necessary that
IFC's investment in the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon be approved
by the Sri Lankan Government and that such approval specify the repatriation
and other rights granted to IFC for its investment.
