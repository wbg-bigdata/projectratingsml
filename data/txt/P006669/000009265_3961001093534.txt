MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed loan to Chile for US$17.2 million is
submitted for your approval. It would finance technical assistance to improve
the economic policy management and decisionmaking capacity of the central
government and strengthen the analytical capability of the Congress.
2.    Background.  Over the past two decades, Chile has undergone profound
economic, social, and political change. A broad series of reforms instituted
over the 1980s touched virtually every aspect of economic and social development-
-from the general policy framework to institutions and financing mechanisms. Not
only did these reforms fundamentally redefine the role of the State to a more
subsidiary one, consistent with the adoption of an economic policy oriented
toward growth led by the private sector, but as an integral part of this process
the relative size, and distinct administrative and financial responsibilities
assigned to each level of government were altered significantly. Many of the
reforms undertaken such as revising the nation's social security system from pay-
as-you-go to individual-vested accounts, placed new administrative and fiscal
demands on the central government.
3.    The current Administration, which assumed office in March 1990, has
committed itself to maintaining the overall macroeconomic policy direction in its
pursuit of growth with equity. While endorsing the desirability of sustaining
key elements of the 1980s reforms (e.g., privatization and decentralization), the
administration has acknowledged the need to strengthen the government's
institutional capacity to translate such development objectives into reality.
Indeed, although Chile has a rich pool of human resources and a long tradition
of attracting competent professionals into the civil service, further improving
the public sector will be an essential corollary to attaining the desired full
transformation of the country into a developed, modern economy.
4.    Strengthening the policy formulation and financial management capacity of
key public sector entities will be essential to permit the new Administration to
share macroeconomic and social policy formulation responsibilities with a newly
elected Congress; to define public investment priorities; to coordinate
development programs across ministries and agencies; and to ensure responsiveness
of economic policy to a highly dynamic economy with still substantial
vulnerability to both internal and external shocks.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Consolidating a democratic political
system after almost 17 years of military rule is among the major tasks which the
current Administration has assumed. The new government is under substantial
pressure to demonstrate that desired social welfare improvements can be achieved
within a democratic setting without compromising macroeconomic stability and
growth. It is both an urgent and challenging task of historic importance.



2
6.    Pursuing the development sgenda within an interactive, multipartite,
conaultative decisionmaking process, inherent to a democracy, places special
demands on the executive and legislative branches both individually and
collectively. This process must be totally transparent, and one in which the
public has confidence. It thus necessitates enhanced information systems, and
staff skilled in policy analysis, budgetary design and performance monitoring.
Moreover, the transition to democracy, cou?led with the many institutional
changes effected by the past government, including decentralization of social
services and establishment of a fully autonomous Central Bank structure, have
created new needs for coordination between distinct levels of government, the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and between the Government and Congress
to ensure that national resources are efficiently and effectively managed.
7.    Indepth knowledge of internal Government operations is essential to
strengthen key economic policy and revenue collection entities (amid growing
concern over tax evasion); to ensure that an adequate regulatory framework is in
place to oversee natural monopolies; and to create select new mechanisms for
governance such as the interministerial Committees. The Government increasingly
has looked to the Bank to provide the requisite technical assistance to respond
expeditiously and decisively to public sector management needs. It perceives the
Bank as a neutral, "honest" independent broker which will assess existing
ins:._tutional capacity from a purely technical perspective and importantly can
help strengthen such capacity, building on knowledge gleaned from extensive
public sector reform and management experience in other countries. The Bank's
involvement in strengthening public sector management, via this project, thus can
play a critical role in the redemocratization of Chile.
8.    The proposed project would build on earlier Bank efforts to improve
economic and public sector management, including three SALs and the first Public
Sector Management Loan (PSM I). Lessons learned from PSM I and incorporated in
PSM II include the need for strong commitment by the Borrower to the project
components, carefully defined project scope, preparation of detailed terms of
reference, minimal unallocated funds, and requirements for periodic project
review to permit adjustments in design and implementation arrangements.
9.    The design of the proposed project is consistent with country development
priorities and the Bank assistance strategy.   It supports maintenance of a
consistent macroeconomic policy framework, through strengthening interagency
coordination and economic policy analysis capability (Ministries of Economy and
Finance and Library of Congress). It also responds to the need, as documented
in recent ESW, to improve revenue administration, the single largest component
of the proposed project.
10.   Prolect  Obiectives.  The  project  aims  to   mprove  overall  central
governmental manrigement efficiency and to enhance Chile's policy formulation and
implementation capacity. Specifically, it would: (a) improve information systems
and management of the principal public financial management agencies; (b)
increase the quality and facilitate the use of information and subsequent
analysis in legislative economic decisionmaking; (c) con-ribute to strengthening
the analytical policy and implementation capacity of the government; and (d)
enhance the capacity to assess critically issues that cross specific development
sectors.



3
11.   Proiect Descrirtio... To achieve these objectives, the proje.t would finance
consultant services, equipment, and training to: (a) develop and/or improve
existing taxpayer and beneficiary management information systems, to include
development of performance indicators in four financial management agencies
(Internal Revenue Service, Customs, Treasury, and Social Security)(US$7.6
million); (b) improve the capacity of the Library of Congress to provide economic
information and analysis, including stren)5thening its reference holdings (US$5.3
million); (c) provide improved economic rAata and information systems and analytic
capacity to guide decisionmaking in the key ministries of Finance and Economy
(US$2.0 million); (d) strengthen the analytical information base available to the
Interministerial Committees (US$0.8 million); and (e) strengthen the Ministry of
Finance's capacity to manage the proposed project (US$0.4 million). The Matrix
of Key Project Activities (Attachment 1) includes information on objectives,
physical outputs, substantive impacts and outcomes, timing targets, and agency
counterparts. These constitute estimated indicators for the project and will
provide the basis for supervision.
12.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$24.0 million, of which
US$17.2 million would be financed by the Bank, including US$11.9 million in
foreign exchange. The Government would finance US$6.8 million equivalent, or
about 28? of project costs.   The detailed cost estimates and methods of
procurement and disbursements are provided in Schedules A and B and discussed in
Annex 1. The project includes refinancing for a Project Preparation Facility
(US$376,000) used to finance consultant services and equipment to assist in the
preparation of terms of reference (TOR) and to facilitate project implementation.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Chile
is attached. The detailed project description, and the project administration
and implerientation arrangements are given in Annex I.   The TOR for major
consultancies were agreed to in principle during appraisal and are available in
the Project File.   The consultants will be selected and equipment will be
procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
13.   Actions Agreed.  The following agreements have been reached: (a) an annual
work plan satisfactory to the Bank for the first year of the project, including
objectives, activities, cost, and expected outcomes; (b) the Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) will be established as a condition of effectiveness and maintained
with a full-time coordinator during the life of the project; (c) for supervision
purposes, the agencies participating in the project will provide measures of
physical progress and project impacts satisfactory to the Bank (Attachment I),
and the PCU will semiannually report such measures to the Bank; (d) to facilitate
comprehensive two and four year reviews, the participating agencies will carry
out the action plan specified in Attachment II; and (e) to facilitate evaluation
of overall project performance, the participating agencies will institute the
agency-level performance indicators delineated in Attachment III no later than
July 1, 1992, with the PCU -o provide status reports relative to those indicators
to the Bank at six-month intervals during the life of the project.
1A. To reduce delays in contracting with consultants, the Government has
delegated to the Subsecretary of Finance the signature of World Bank financed
contracts with consultants and consulting firms less than 90 days in length and
for expenditures less than US$4,500 per month. The Government also agreed that



4
if the "delegation decree" were to be modified or abrogated, thereby adversely
affecting the execution of any Bank financed project in Chile, such action would
constitute an event of default.
15.   A condition of disbursement for the Internal Revenue Service and Customs
components is the appointment of subproject component coordinators satisfactory
to the Bank. A condition of disbursement for the Ministry of Finance component
is the appointment of key  taff in the International Studies Unit and the
Macroeconomic Studies Unit.   Conditions of disbursement for the Congress
component are the appointment of a subproject component coordinator satisfactory
to the Bank and an arrangement between the Ministry of Finance and the Congress
stipulating their respective responsibilities with respect to this project
subcomponent under terms satisfactory to the Bank.
16.   A condition of effectiveness is the esLablishment of a Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.
17.   Benefits  and  Risks.  The  project  would  strengthen  key  government
institutions responsible for national policymaking, especially economic
management, and increase the effectiveness of financial management institutions.
It would also improve the technical basis for economic policymaking and assist
in the design of public organizations, thereby affording the potential for
increased economic and public sector efficiency. There is some risk of slow
implementation of the Congress component because of that institution's
inexperience with management of foreign technical assistance. To minimize this
risk, the Ministry of Finance and the Congress will sign a detailed agreement
setting forth their respective responsibilities with respect to this component
(para. 15); moreover, the Congress will establish a coordinating unit for this
project component, satisfactory to the Bank.  In add tion, the project could
result in some small increase in Government spendiag (in addition to the
estimated additional US$1 million in operating and maintenance cests associated
with equipment acquired under the project); it is anticipated that any spending
increase would be more than offset by project-related efficiency gains, which
have been specified (Attachment I) and will be carefully monitored and
supervised.
18.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.

Annex I
CHILE
SECOND PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
SECTION A. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.          Background.  Over the past two decades, Chile's public sector has
experienced a number of important structural changes.   Central government
employment and expenditures have been reduced, while important functions (e.g.,
social security, education) have been partly privatized or decentralized to
municipal governments. Government's role in guiding economic activity has been
reduced and rationalized, and most public enterprises have been divested. More
recently, the Central Bank was given autonomous status, and civil service
protection extended to most government employees.   These changes have been
supported by the Bank, including the First Public Sector Management Project (PSM
I). That project increased public sector efficiency through the finance of
management improvements in several public agencies.
2.          Despite the contribution of the policy reforms of the prior two
decades, the new Administration entered office in March 1990 facing a number of
potentially serious problems in public sector management. They include (i) risk
of fraud and tax evasion and inefficient resource allocation in institutions
responsible for tax collection and benefits administration; (ii) insufficient
objective and analytic information to inform legislative actions in economic
policy; (iii) inadequate analyses of fiscal, trade, and market policies to inform
ministerial decisionmaking; and (iv) potential paralysis in decisionmaking on
interministerial issues. While each problem has a number of distinct causes, the
more important causes ares (i) outdated or obsolete computer and information
systems in financial management institutions, combined with reductions in
personnel or increases in workload; (ii) lack of investment in and neglect of
public institutions responsible for informing legislative decisions on economic
policy; (iii) institutional changes that remove Central Brnx analysts from the
Ministry of Finance and create privatized natural monopolies requiring government
regulation; and (iv) redundant ministerial responsibilities combined with
inadequate mechanisms for coordinating policies across ministries.
3.          Proiect Comonents. The Second Public Sector Management Project (PSM
II) would finance the services of international and national consultants, both
long and short term, staff training, equipment, and studies to (i) increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of Government operations to raise revenues and
administer benefits; (ii) improve economic policymaking of the legislature
through provision of information, analysis, and communication; (iii) improve
economic policy analysis and implementation of the Ministries of Finance and
Economy; (iv) improve policy coordination and government organization; and (v)
ensure sufficient capacity to coordinate and manage the project. A matrix of key
project activities and objectives is included as Attachment I to this Technical
Annex.
4.          The efficiency and effectiveness of Government operations to raise
revenues and administer benefits are increased by financing consultants,
equipment, and training to four financial management institutions: the Internal
Revenue Service (Servicio de Impuestos Internos), the Treasury (Tesoraria),



13                           ANNEX 1
Page 13
Customs (Aduanas), and the Social Security Institute (Instituto de Normalizacion
Previsional).
S.          Legislative information, analysis, and communication to improve
economic policymaking is enhanced by financing consultants, equipment, training,
and studies to: strengthen information and reference services provided by the
Library of Congress (LOC); and increase the utilization of information and
analysis in policymaking by educating users and improving the communications
system between the LOC, the Congress, the Ministries, and other users of Library
services.
6.          Economic policy analysis and implementation are improved by financing
consultants and supporting equipment and studies to the Ministries of Finance and
Economy.
7.          Policy coordination and government organization are improved by
financing studies to examine interministerial problems and issues, including an
external evaluation of the IMCs leading to recommendations for improvements.
8.          Capacity to coordinate and manage the PSM II project are increased
by financing consultants to manage consultant contr-%cts and equipment
procurement, prepare semiannual and annual project reports, and monitor the
progress of all prcject components.
9.          PSM 11 will complement technical assistance provided by other
international and bilateral agencies.   UNDP initially financed key staff
positions in several ministries to enable the Government to operate under severe
budgetary restrictions during its first year in office.  USAID has provided
assistance to the Catholic University of Valparaiso to provide training for the
new Congress.
10.        Past Experience.  Past Bank experience with free-standing technical
assistance loans provides several lessons that are incorporated in the design of
PSM II. These lessons are derived from OED assessment of free-standing technical
assistance in Africa and LAC Technical Department evaluations of recently
completed public sector management projects in Chile (2504-CH) and Peru
(2204-PE).
II.         These lessons include:  (i) TA projects should be limited in scope
to permit adequate preparation, focused implementation, and adequate supervision;
(ii) Borrower commitment is essential to develop a sense of ownership of project
activities in affected institutions, resulting in effective implementation;
(iii) unallocated funding in the project design should be minimized; (iv) there
should be continuity in project management; (v) terms of reference for
consultants and studies should be spelled out in detail prior to project
negotiations; and (vi) there should be periodic evaluation of projects to permit
adjustments in design and implementation arrangements.
12.         The First Public Sector Management Project (PSM I), which closed on
December 31, 1990, demonstrates some of these lessons. As approved by the Board
on March 14, 1985, the loan provided US$11.0 million to improve: (i) public
sector investment planning; (ii) public enterprise management; (iii) economic
statistics;  and  (iv)  export  promotion  activities.    Only  those  proposed
consultancies and studies for which detailed terms of reference were prepared
prior to project effectiveness were implemented quickly.   Since there were



14                           ANNEX 1
Page 14
US$2.0 million in unallocated funding and most consultancies and studies were not
well-defined, only 5 percent of the loan was disbursed two and one-half years
after the  date  of effectiveness.    A  cumbersome  arrangement  for project
administration combined with frequent changes in project coordinators contributed
to implementation delays.
13.         Slow implementation, changing country conditions and needs, and
renewed commitment by the Government to the project led to changes in project
priorities, reduction in the loan amount to US$6.5 million, and full
specification of all project components in February 1988. The revised project
provided  financing  for:       (i)  public  sector  investment  and  planning
(US$2.0 million), including a household survey to assess social program
targeting, developing a regional data network to expedite work of the
Contraloria, and conducting an organizational study of Fiscalia to recommend
improvements in the Government's capacity to identify and prosecute
anticompetitive practices; (ii) public enterprise management (US$ 1.7 million),
including development of a management information system to facilitate operation
of the Santiago subway as an independent enterprise and development of
administrative structures and information systems to reorganize the state-owned
water company (SENDOS) into regional corporations; (iii) economic statistics (US$
1.7 million), including a household survey to develop new market basket weights
for the CPI; (iv) export promotion (US$0.5 million), including strengthening
PROCHILE to provide technical assistance to small and medium-sized exporters
through commercial information systems and international marketing; and (v) other
technical assistance, including development of a methodology to measure the
environmental impact of energy projects, development of consumer standards for
electrical applicances, and development of a fis aries model.
14.         Project  revision  also  led  to  project  administration  being
streamlined, with the project coordinator subsequently given substantial
authority and autonomy.   Subsequent  to this date,  there was  substantial
continuity in project personnel, and project implementation proceeded with few
problems, although the long delay in initiating many project components resulted
in two extensions to the loan closing date. Information obtained for the purpose
of writing the Project Completion Report (PCR) demonstrates that almost all
project components attained their stated objectives, and most project results are
being sustained through followup and implementing activities on the part of
affected Government  agencies.   PSM I project activities  and results are
summarized in Attachment 2 to this Technical Annex.
15.         The lessons learned from past stand-alone TA loans, and especially
the experience with PSM I, have been incorporated into the design of PSM II. The
design of the project also has been guided by Bank country strategy aimed at
maintaining the policy framework and improving public sector efficiency both in
terms of facilitating well-informed policy and budgetary decisions and carrying
out those decisions in a dynamic decisionmaking and implementation environment.
Thus, the project strengthens the decisionmaking capacity of select Government
institutions as well as modernizes and enhances the capacity to implement
existing policies.  While different from PSM I in terms of specific project
components, PSM II and PSM I are similar in terms of broad objectives and
sustaining support for country strategy.
16.       In addition to being consistent with country strategy and objectives,
the scope of PSM II has been guided bys  (i) Borrower commitment to project
objectives and components; and (ii) requirements for effective project

Page 15
administration and supervision. The initial impetus for the project and its
componenta came from the Government, which demonstrated its further commitment
by requesting a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to facilitate and expedite
project preparation.   The Government has consistently reiterated the high
priority it attaches to rapid approval and implementation of PSM II, while
recognizing the constraints on processing imposed by the limited experience of
many Government decisionmakers with project preparation activities. Effective
project administration and supervision requires both a limited, well-defined
project scope and detailed preparation of all project components. The scope of
PSM II has been limited to four well-defined components, with two components
representing 80 percent of loan funds. Terms of reference, including quarterly
activity and disbursement plans, were prepared for all consultants and studies
during appraisal, and draft bidding documents were revie-ued during negotiations.
To facilitate administration and supervision, indicators of project activities
and outputs were agreed to during negotiations, including those indicators to be
used for supervision.
17.         Environment.  The project does not directly address environmental
considerations, in large part because other Bank operations will focus solely on
technical assistance to improve environmental institutions.  PSM II indirectly
affects environmental issues, however, through its strengthening of the IMCs,
which may discuss environmental issues in the context of infrastructure or
business development policy.
I. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
18.         Four Government  institutions have principal responsibility for
revenue collection (including taxes, social security and social insurance
contributions) and benefits administration (including disability, pension, and
family benefit payments). These are the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the
General Treasury, the Customs Office, and the Social Security Institute (SSI).
The IRS maintains a register of all active taxpayers of the value added tax
(VAT), the income and property taxes and audits taxpayer accounts and returns.
The General Treasury is responsible for collecting payments due for the VAT,
income, and property taxes; it determines tax liability arrears and receives
payments of both current tax liabilities and arrears. Customs reviews taxpayer
self-assessments of import duties; inspects and analyzes imported goods; and
administers the export subsidy program. The SSI collects pension and health
contributions; maintains tax payment, pension benefit, and family benefit
records; audits taxpayer accounts and determines arrears; determines pension
eligibility and makes pension payments; and issues family benefit payments
(asignaciones familiares).
A. Framework
19.         The Chilean tax system is designed to avoid distortions in relative
prices and preserve market signals and incentives, although tax loopholes affect
this ideal perspective. Unlike most other countries in the region, the Chilean
tax administration environment is generally favorable. Taxpayers essentially
support compliance enforcement; tax evasion is not socially sanctioned; and the
informal economy is relatively small. Inflation has not negatively affected tax
administration because tax laws include automatic inflation adjustments. Finally



16                           ANNEX I
Page 16
the legal system is stable, and enforcement rules are adequate to deter
noncompliance.
20.         Government revenues show a declining trend over the last decade.
Revenues dropped almost 4 points of GDP during the 1980s despite the recovery of
copper prices in 1988. Tax revenues remained relatively constant, while user
charge revenues increased. Capital revenues derived from the privatization of
public enterprised were an important revenue source from 1982 to 1987.   In
response to lower revenues and increased demand for social sector spending, the
Government increased tax rates in 1990.
21.         The composition of tax revenues was changed by tax reforms in 1975,
1984 and 1990. In 1975, the value added tax (VAT) was introduced as the main tax
revenue source for Chile, and corporate income tax rates were substantially
reduced. In 1984 and 1990, the income tax evolved towards an expenditure tax due
to the exclusion of savings from its base, and rates were lowered on both the
income tax and VAT. The Chilean tqx system currently consists of a few broad
based taxes at nearly uniform rates.
22.         In contrast to most Latin American countries, this evolution to a
large extent reflects a deliberate effort of the government to define
simultaneously an efficient tax system and adjust it to reduced public
expenditures. Increased evasion and fraud, especially in export tax rebates (VAT
and import duties) and export subsidies, have resulted in growing revenue losses
to the Government. Increased evasion and fraud in turn may be the result of an
increasingly outdated tax administration system.
23.         Increased evasion and fraud signals the possibility of future fiscal
problems.    The windfall of copper revenues may be transitory,  and  the
disappearance of capital revenues from privatization is evident. The VAT rate
is sufficiently high to raise questions about the desirability of further
increases to compensate for decreases in copper revenues, especially following
the 1990 VAT tax rate increase. Hence, further reducing the gap between actual
and potential revenue of the existing tax system becomes an attractive option.
To do so will require modernization of the tax administration system.
24.         The organizational design of Chile's tax administration is unusual.
The division of work between tax assessments (IRS and Customs) and tax payments
(Treasury) is not common. IRS and Customs are responsible for determining tax
liabilities, but the General Treasury has responsibility for actual collections.
This division of responsibilities causes some operational redundancies and
inconsistencies, but it may also contribute to a solid audit control technology.
25.         Chile also differs from most Latin American countries in the
effective functioning of its tax administration.  While most Latin American
countries have unsuccessfully addressed the problem of the current account,
Chile's Treasury has achieved a relatively sophisticated integration of tax
accounts by taxpayer. In addition, Chile's audit operation is among the best in
Latin America.   While the overall system currently functions well, further
modernization could yield significant revenue gains as well as improvements in
tax administration efficiency.

B. Internal Revenue Service
26.         The IRS is responsible for tax law enforcement, especially as regards
the Value-Added Tax (VAT) ard the personal and business income taxes; these taxes
represent 79Z of total tax revenues and 371 of all government revenues in Chile.
Enforcement consists of detecting evasion through inspection of data bases and
through audits; enforcement contributes to government rever.aes by ensuring tax
compliance.
27.         The IRS has 2,800 employees at a central office in Santiago, sixteen
regional offices, and forty-six provincial or local offices; the decentralized
offices process tax return information and transmit that information to Santiago
for inclusion in the master file, which includes four years of data on each
taxpayer, and subsequent analysis.   Ireasury complements the data with the
centralized inclusion of payments.   The regional offices and sixteen of the
provincial offices have computer linkages to Santiago, while the remaining thirty
local offices process and transmit information by hand.
28.         Problems.  Tax evasion affects both government revenues (increasing
the overall fiscal deficit) and the equity of the tax cystem. While evasion
rates in Chile are not high by Latin American standards, there is room for
improvement. An IRS study, for example, estimates a VAT evasion rate of 351 on
domestic transactions. In addition, the ratio of fiscal debit to fiscal credit,
a widely used instrument to detect tax evasion, has declined in the industrial
sector over the past decade. Finally, agricultural and other sectors that are
exempt from submitting receipts to the IRS can conceal transactions and evade the
VAT.
29.         Auditing problems contribute to evasion.  Under the present system,
computer support to audits is centralized and lacks the flexibility and
interactive features required for the auditor to build an individual audit
strategy. Other problems that contribute to inefficiency include: (a) delays
and inaccuracies in entering data in the master file caused by manual processing
at the local IRS offices; (b) multiple (nine interactive information systems
plus five batch systems) and incompatible data files at the central office due
to limited computer capacity and antiquated file management design; and (c)
inefficient allocation of IRS audit and enforcement resources.   The latter
problem is due to the fact the IRS does not collect the information necessary
either to assess its own performance in deterring evasion or to allocate
optimally its own resources to maximize its effectiveness.
30.         Planned Technical Assistance to the IRS (USS2.3 million in DroDosed
Bank financing}. IRS performance could be strengthened through improvements in
data collection, processing, and analysis to detect fraud and evasion.   The
project will consist of expanding and improving the information system to the
thirty local offices not yet connected to the computer network; redesign of
master file data bases to facilitate data use and analysis; expansion of central
computer capacity to support the new data base structure; improvements in other
hardware and software to facilitate use of the data bases by auditors; and
development of an information system and analytic methods to yield current data
on the performance and productivity of tax administration activities.
31.         The results of these improvements would be increased individual
auditor productivity, improved data quality and access, reduced fraud and
evasion, and increased tax revenues.   The IRS estimates a minimum 1 percent



18                           ANNEX I
Page 18
reduction in VAT evasion, which would generate almost US$9 million in additional
annual revenue. The information and analytic system would also permit quarterly
reports on tax performance and efficiency over the life of the project. Another
important result would be improved efficiency in IRS resource allocation.
32.         During negotiations, agreement was reached that: (i) the IRS will
provide semiannual reports to the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) on indicators
of physical progress and project results satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment
I), which, in turn, the PCU will provide to the Bank; (ii) the action plan stated
in Attachment II for the IRS will be carried out; (iii)  to monitor overall
agency performance, the Government would collect data and measure the tax evasion
detected and thereafter collected as a percentage of total tax collections and
will furnish such measurements to the Bank commencing July 1, 1992, and by
January 1 and July 1 of each year thereafter for the life of the project. The
IRS will prepare and report such measurements which the PCU will then provide to
the Bank.   A condition of disbursement for the Internal Revenue Service
assistance is the appointment of a subproject component coordinator satisfactory
to the Bank.
C. Customs
33.         During the last few years, trade activity has increased substartially
as a consequence of the opening of the economy. Exports have grown dramatically,
and tax rebate systems have been established. Though desirable in principle, tax
rebates are difficult to administer properly and have a high incidence of fraud.
The time required for Customs to control trade transactions to deter fraud
conflicts with the Government's policy goal of facilitating trade.
34.         The Customs Office in 1989 had a budget of US$6 million and 1100
employees in a central office (Valparaiso), nine regional offices, and 165 border
stations. It is responsible for enforcing trade laws, determining and collecting
import duties (US$2.1 billion annually), administering the Government's program
of subsidies to nontraditional exports (US$0.8 billion annually), administering
the reimbursement of duties paid on inputs used to produce exported goods,
administering the reimbursement of value-added taxes paid on exported goods,
generating trade statistics, and expeditiously processing documents to facilitate
trade.
35.         Problems. Customs faces problems of evasion in paying import duties
and fraud in programs to subsidize nontraditional exports as well as reimburse
payments of import duties and the VAT on exported goods. While there are no
reliable estimates of the overall magnitude of these problems, there have been
numerous, well-publicized cases of large-scale fraud and evasion; known fraud
caused about US$20 million in revenue losses in 1990. These problems are the
result of increased workload, outdated computer hardware and software systems,
poorly trained agents, antiquated customs laboratory facilities, and agency
inefficiency.
36.         The workload of Customs has expanded in recent years while its
resources have diminished.  Total trade (imports plus exports) increased 48X
between 1980 and 1989, while the number of customs employees increased by 17Z,
and the customs budget decreased by 20Z. In this same time period, important new
programs administered by customs were introduced, including the subsidy to
nontraditional exports introduced in 1985, reimbursement of duties paid on inputs
to produce exported gcods introduced in 1988, ond reimbursement of VAT levies on



19                           ANNEX 1
Page 19
exported goods also introduced in 1988. In addition, in 1989 Chile adopted a new
standardized international classification system for goods.
37.         The obsolesence of existing computer hardware and software has had
a number of negative effects, including: long delays in data entry and computer
communications, thus limiting the information available to customs agents for
determining values of goods, appropriately classifying goods, and detecting fraud
and evasion; and severely reducing complementary linkages to other te.
administration agencies (IRS and Treasury). These problerms, together with the
lack of training for either new or experienced customs agents, serve to limit
agent productivity. An outdated customs laboratory restricts the capacity of
Customs to analyze traded goods and leads to errors in that analysis; the result
is failure to examine and correctly classify goods, which reduces the ability to
detect and deter evasion and fraud in tax collection and export subsidy
administration. Finally, Customs lacks a management information system that sets
targets or monitors quantitative performance of the regional offices and border
stations or generates the information required to allocate optimally enforcement
and collection resources to areas of high fraud probability.
38.         Planned Technical Assistance to Customs (USSl.7 million).   The
project would finance the development of a modern computer and communication
system to improve the auditing function in Customs; development of the capacity
for the Agency to provide specialized training to its agents; rehabilitation of
the Customs chemical laboratory; and development of an information system to
assess and monitor efficiency in budgetary resources.  Ths technical assistance
will occur in two phases--first, the computer system, training, chemical
laboratory, and information system will be designed; second, the computer
hardware, software, training, and laboratory improvements will be implemented.
The development of agency performance indicators will be included in the design.
39.          The project should result in several tangible benefits, including
improved product classification and valuation; faster data processing; reduced
administrative time required of customs agents, and thus increased agent
productivity; more effective training of agents, also resulting in increased
productivity; improved and more timely statistical reports on trade to the
Ministry of Finance; and information on agency performance.
40.        During negotiations, agreement was reached that Customs will provide
semiannual reports to the PCU on indicators of physical progress and project
impact satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment I) which the PCU will then
provide to the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was also reached that the
action plan stated in Attachment II for Customs will be carried out. To monitor
overall agency performance, during negotiations agreement was reached that the
Government would collect data and measure:   (a) import duties charged as a
percentage of the value of total imports; and (b) export subsidies grAnted as a
percentage of the value of total export subsidies, and furnish to t-he Bank such
measurements commencing July 1, 1992, and by December 1 and July 1 of each year
thereafter for the life of the project. Customs will prepare and report such
measurements for the PCU to provide to the Bank. A condition of disbursement for
the Customs component is the appointment of a subproject coordinator satisfactory
to the Bank.

D. Treasury
41.         The Treasury has a total of 1,130 employees, including those who work
in the General T-easury in Santiago and In the 26 regional and provincial
off ices. The decentralized of fices are connected via a national computer network
and are responsible for government revenue collection including taxes (IVA,
income, property taxes), debts (e.g., student loans), arrears, fines, and
penalties; maintenance of a taxpayer master file (the Cuenta Unicr Tributaria or
CUT) that keeps track of payments and outstanding balances; and distribution of
revenues. The Treasury contracts with private institutions, principally banks,
to collect most revenues. Payments are recorded on sixty different tvpes of
forms, with approximately 1.4 million such documents processed each month. The
central office receives documentation from regional offices; enters the data
(with about 402 of the effort contracted privately); validates it; develops
current reports for the Comptroller General, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Central Bank; and updates the master file. In addition, the Treasury monitors
and enforces the collection of past-due debts; allocates revenues in accordance
with the Budget Law or other laws (e.g., distribution of property tax revenues
to municipalities); and returns excess tax payments (e.g., the personal income
tax).
42.         Problems.    There  are  long  delays  (iix weeks)  in  recording
transactions in the system, and a high error rate (22) of data entry that
threatens the quality of the results; these data problems prevent the early
identification and collection of erroneous payments. The data problem combined
with inadequate collection capacity has resulted in accumulated overdue taxes
exceeding US$250 million, about 70S of which are collectible. These problems are
due to insufficient computational and data processing capacity aggravated by peak
workloads when income tax and property tax payments are due; insufficient
personnel (especially legal staff), with the total number of Treasury employees
having declined by two-thirds over the past three years; and lack of an
information system to develop performance indicators and improve management.
These problems impair the capacity of the Treasury to respond to taxpayer
inquiries; make it difficult to generate timely data for macroeconomic
management; and reduce Government revenues through delays in detecting payment
arrears. A further problem is approximately US$2 million of annual fraud and
forgery of Treasury checks.
43.         Planned Technical Assistance to the Treasury  (USS1.6 million}.
Treasury performance could be increased through improvements in data, check, and
bill processing timing and quality; improvements in data transmission to and use
by regional Treasury offices; and introduction of an information system to permit
the monitoring of the agency's performance. The project will consist of the
introduction of new technology to handle peak workloads; modifications in
existing computer hardware and software, and employee training to increase the
processing and use of data in the regional and provincial offices; and design and
implementation of a performance information system.   The investments to be
financed by the Bank would complement Government investments in the Treasury,
especially the increase in the number of lawyers (currently twenty-eight)
assigned to collect past-due debts.
44.         The results of the technical assistance would be increased employee
productivity, reduced processing time, reduced response time to taxpayer
inquiries, more timely reports on revenue collections, shorter lags in providing
information to regional offices on unpaid liabilities and past-due debts,



21                           ANNEX 1
Page 21
increased revenues, and improved resource allocation within the Treasury. The
Treasury estimates annual additional revenues would increase by US$9 million; an
additional US$17 million in debts would be collected as a result of the technical
assistance; and check fraud would be substantially reduced.   In addition,
improvements in the information system would permit assessment6 of agency
performance, which would provide the Government with information regarding the
need for and likely results of further budgetary investments to improve Treasury
operations.
45.          During negotiations agreement was reached that the Treasury will
provide semiannual reports to the PCU on indicators of physical progress and
project impacts satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment I) for the PCU to
provide to the Bank. During negotiations agreement was also reached that the
action plan for the Treasury outlined in Attachment II will be carried out. To
monitor overall agency performance, during negotiations agreement was reached
that the Government would collect data and measure the recovery of tax arrears
as a percentage of total arrears and furnish such measurements to the Bank
commencing July 1, 1992, and by January 1 and July 1 of each year thereafter for
the life of the project. The Treasury will prepare and report such measurements
for the PCU to provide to the Bank.
D. Social Security Institute (SSI)
46.         Decree Law 3502 of 1980 created the SSI, an agency under the Ministry
of Labor and Social Security, for the purpose of managing the unfunded social
security system; approximately four million individual accounts remain in that
system after the change to funded pension plans. Between 1980 and 1988 twenty-
one separate public pension funds with their respective employees, accounting
systems, and operating procedures were integrated into the INP.
47.         As  presently  constituted,  the  SSI  has  large  and  complex
responsibilities. It makes monthly pension payments to 1,720,000 beneficiaries
for a total of US$1.2 billion annually, and collects monthly social security and
insurance taxes from 330,000 employers and 2,200,000 workers. In addition, it
pays monthly benefits (Asignaciones Familiares) to 1,500,000 families and
processes some 60,000 new pensions annually. While most of the routine data
processing operations are provided by private sector contractors, the SSI is
responsible for management of the system.
48.         Problems.  The SSI lacks the capacity to fulfill adequately these
diverse responsibilities.   The results are high tax evasion, tax arrears,
fraudulent pension claims, long delays in determining pension benefits and
responding to member inquiries, and administrative inefficiency. Accumulated tax
arrears are estimated at about US$500 million. In addition, annual tax evasion
is estimated at US$15.8 million, and fraudulent pension claims are conservatively
estimated at US$16 million annually. Delays in processing and evaluating pension
benefit claims are as long as 12 months. Administrative errors are high, with
652 of all pension benefit applications incurring errors at some stage of
processing.
49.         These problems result from the failure to integrate completely the
personnel and administrative systems of the twenty-one pension funds that
comprise SSI; lack of control over the production process; lack of reliable and
accessible data bases on tax and insuratnce payments, employment and salary



22                           ANNEX I
Page 22
histories of individual contributors and beneficiaries; and lack of a modern
system to detekt tax evasion.
50.         Planned Technical Assistance  to SSI  (USS2.0 million).    The
Government has initiated efforts, beginning with the FY91 budget, to solve the
fraudulent claim problem through investments to permit accurate monitoring of
legal actions and to increase the productivity of the INP legal staff.
51.         The project would finance investments in revenue collection and
pension benefits administration to complement the Government's investment.
Revenue collection would be improved through consultancies, equipment, software,
and training to reorganize collection and enforcement activities and implement
a system of evas_on control.  The revenue collection component would include a
diagnosis of the existing system, construction and cleaning of a taxpayer data
base, design of a system to control evasion and improve collections,
implementation of the system, and development of performance indicators and the
establishment of an information system to measure and monitor performance. The
results will include increased employee productivity, improvements in tax
collection, reductions in tax evasion, and semiannual performance reports over
the life of the project.
52.         Pension  benefits  administration  would  be  improved  through
consultancies, equipment, software, and training to integrate the twenty-one
funds in one data processing system; aystematically determine the legal
restrictions and obligations of each fund; clean and construct accurate data
bases on individual accounts and current account payments; design and implement
an information system that allows employees rapid and accurate access to account
information; and development of performance indicators and the establishment of
an information system to measure and monitor performance.  The results will
include increased employee productivity, increased capacity to identify problems
in collections and payments, and semiannual performance reports over the life of
the project.
53.         During negotiations, agreement was reached that the SSI will provide
semiannual reports to the PCU on indicators of physical progress and project
impacts satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment I) for the PCU to provide to the
Bank. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the action plan stated in
Attachment II for the SSI will be carried out.   To monitor overall agency
performance, during negotiations agreement was reached that the Government will
c -lect data and measure:  (a) tax evasion detected and thereafter collected as
i ?ercentage of total tax collections; and (b) the number of errors, unit costs,
and elapsed time in processing pension applications and furnish such measurements
to the Bank commencing July 1, 1992, and by January ! and July 1 of each year
thereafter for the life of the project. The SSI will prepare and report such
measurements for the PCU to provide subsequently to the Bank.
II.  LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS FOR ECONOMIC POLICY
54.         With the March 1990 change in government, economic legislation now
can originate with either the executive branch or the Congress in Chile, but both
branches of government as well as private foundations, universities, and other
analysts play a role in designing and approving economic policies. Under the
Constitution of 1980, Congress has the authority to approve or modify the



23                           ANEX I
Page 23
proposed budget; to approve or amend legislation introduced by the executive
branch; and to introduce legislation.   Congress cannot increase expenditure
categories in the budget, and it cannot introduce spending legislation, although
it can introduce other legislation that affects economic policies. Political
experts widely believe the budget role of Congress is likely to increase over
time as Congress acquires more budgeting expertise and experience.
55.         To carry out effectively its responzibilities in budgetary and
economic policy, the legislature and other legislative actors require
comprehensive, pertinent information and impartial analysis. Modern legislatures
receive such information from diverse sources: universities, political think
tanks, interest groups, governmen'. agencies, and legislative libraries and
research services. In Chile, universities are providing assistance to Congress
on an experimental basis. Both ILADES and the Catholic University of Valparaiso
have received short-run external funding to provide mainly constitutional and
legal analyses to the Congress. Think tanks affiliated with political parties,
like CIEPLAN and the Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo, have the reputation for
providing high quality, if partisan, analyses.   With few exceptions (e.g.,
SOFOPA) interest groups do not play an organized, important role in informing
Congress. Government ministries and the Secretariat of the President provide
information to Congress concerning legislation proposed by the executive branch.
Finally, the Library of Congress (LOC), authorized by the Constituticnal Law of
the Congress (Law 18,918 of February 5, 1990) as part of the administrative
offices of the Congress, has the responsibility to provide nonpartisan, objective
information to the Congress and other users.   The Director of the LOC is
appointed by and reports to the Congressional leadership (Presidents of the
Senate and the House of Deputies). The LOC and its 24 professional librarians
do not typically directly respond to requests from individual legislators;
rather, LOC staff usually work closely with the staff of the twelve legislative
commissions of both the House of Deputies and the Senate, the professional staff
of the Information Centers of the House and Senate, and requests from academic
and other users. These staff have the responsibility of assembling information
and analyses on current issues before the Congress.
56.         Problems.  Legislative libraries and research services play a very
important role in informing policymakers and legislatures in most advanced
democracies. (Germany is an exception with its reliance on government-funded,
partisan think tanks.) The LOC has traditionally provided library reference and
bill-tracking services to the Congress and other library users; for example, the
LOC maintains a computer in Valparaiso to record the country's laws and to track
legislation and participates in an on-line bibliographic information exchange
with the National Library and university libraries. Both the capacity of the LOC
to serve its users and the ability of Congressional staff to use the services of
the LOC to inform Congress have deteriorated significantly over the past
seventeen years of inactivity.
57.         The LOC lacks the capacity to:  (i) searzh quickly and retrieve
information in rtsponse to user requests; (ii) provide analyses and summaries of
information; and (iii) effectively and quickly communicate with users. These
problems are caused by antiquated library technology, insufficient and outdated
holdings, inadequately trained reference librarians, and lack of a communications
network tying the LOC to users, especially in the Congress.   The existing
communications network consists of a LOC on-line linkage to the Valparaiso
computer. Congressional staff and other users lack the knowledge and experience
to use effectively LOC services and lack a communications network to facilitate



24                           ANNEX 1
Page 24
such use. The latter is especially important given the current locations of the
LOC (Santiago) and the Congress (Valparaiso). The project would improve both the
capacity of the LOC to serve Library users and increase their ability to use
effectively the LOC, thereby improving legislative information and economic
policy formulation.
58.         In Chile the Executive branch plays an important legislative role.
The President delegates to the Secretariat of the Presidency (SEGPRES) the
overall responsibility for coordinating legislative initiatives with the
Congress, including managing initiatives originating in the diverse ministries
and communicating them to Congress. The importance of this role is demonstrated
by the fact that in the past year the Executive has originated most (90%) of the
bills considered by the Congress including the annual budget bill.   The
legislative management role of SEGPRES is exercised by the Legislative Division,
which communicates texts, summaries, and technical analyses of bills and
amendments to the Congress. At present, this management function is impeded by
the lack of on-line communications with either the Congress or the LOC.  In
addition, the quality of technical analyses that precede legislative initiatives
could be improved through access to LOC information and Congressional staff
analysis.
59.         Planned Technical Assistance to Strenpthen Information and Reference
Services (USS 3.1 million).    The capacity of the new Congress to evaluate
economic legislation is strongly tied to the quality of information and analyses
it receives from the LOC,  the Ministries, and Congressional staff.   LOC
collections need to be expanded and updated, including the addition of
international data bases, and the acquisition and cataloging systems should be
computerized.   Reference librarians need additional  specialized training,
including in the use of new data bases and new library technology as well as new
skills in reporting and analyzing information for users.   The project will
finance technical assistance to expand and automate collections; train librarians
in modern legislative reference techniques, the uise of new technology, and
economic and fiscal analysis; and provide the LOC with the computer hardware and
software required to relate large data bases. These improvements will benefit
Congress as wall as the executive branch and other LOC users, including
university researchers. The results will include quicker response by the LOC to
more user requests for more complete information covering a wider range of
issues.
60.         Planned Technical Assistance to Facilitate Use of the System (US$ 2.2
million}. The LOC requires a modern communications system for effective use of
the Library by consumers, including Congressional staff, Government ministries,
and university researchers. Given the physical distance between the LOC and the
Congress, one important requirement of the system is the ability of users to make
requests and receive responses on-line. Proposed counterpart financing by the
European Economic Community will further link the LOC to regional offices of the
Congress, thereby ensuring national access to the system.
61.         The important role of the Executive in initiating and providing
technical analyses of legislation requires that it have the capacity to "feed"
the LOC and thus provide information to the Congress. The project would finance
the design and installation of a communications system between principal LOG
users, including Congressional staff, SEGPRES staff, and the Library; this
includes hardwiring staff terminals to a "gateway" computer connected to the
Library.



25                           ANNEX 1
Page 25
62.         The effectiveness of Congressional staff in soliciting information
from the LOC and generating high-quality, useful evaluations for the Congress
depends on the analytic capacity of the staff as well as the quality and quantity
of information available from the LOC. The existing Congressional staff lacks
analytic skills and knowledge of how the services of the LOC should best be
utilized.  Hence, the project will finance consultants expert in legislative
analysis to train existing staff.
63.           A Congressional Coordinating Unit (CCU) in the Congress will be
established to execute this project component. The CCU administrator will report
to the Congressional leadership (the Presidents of the Senate and the House of
Deputies) and the group of Senators and Deputies that comprise the Bilateral
Commission and advise the Congressional leadership. For the purposes of project
design and implementation, the Director of the LOC will report to the CCU
administrator.  The CCU will maintain records and accounts for this project
component and will submit them to the PCU for auditing with other project
component accounts; will, with the Director of the LOC, develop training programs
for Library staff and Congress staff; will, with the Director of the LOC and
SEGPRES, prepare terms of reference for consultants and prepare bidding documents
for equipment; and will contract consultants and studies and equipment purchases.
64.        During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Congress through
the CCU will provide semiannual reports to the PCU, satisfactory to the Bank, on
indicators of physical progress and project results (see Attachment I) for the
PZU then to provide to the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was reached that
the action plan for the Congress outlined in Attachment II will be carried out.
To monitor overall agency performance, during negotiations agreement was reached
that the Congress through the CCU will collect data and measure: (i) the number
of requests for information and analysis from the Library of Congress, and (ii)
the amount of staff time to retrieve infcrmation required for legislative
analysis, and will furnish such measurements to the Bank commencing July 1, 1992,
and by July 1 and December 31 of each year thereafter for the life of the
project.  Conditions of disbursement for the Congress component are: (i) the
establishment of a Congressional Coordinating Unit (CCU); (ii) the appointment
of a sub-project coordinator satisfactory to the Bank and; (iii) the signing of
an agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Congress setting forth their
respective responsibilities (described in para. 63 above) with respect to the
Congress component under terms satisfactory to the Bank.
III.  ECONOMIC POLICY FORMULATION AMD ANALYSIS
65.         The responsibility for economic policy formulation and implementation
in the Government is shared by the Central Bank and the Ministries of Finance,
Economy, and Planning, with most decisionmaking power centralized in the Ministry
of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for fiscal policy (revenue
collection, budgeting, investment priorities, and expenditure authorization);
international economic relations (with the participation of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs); and, with the Central Bank, international financial relations
(external debt and credit); and shares responsibility with the Ministry of
Economy for export and foreign investment policies and approval of public
enterprise budgets.   In addition, the Ministry of Finance presides over the
Macroeconomic Interministerial Committee (IMC) and participates in Central Bank



26                           ANNEX 1
Page 26
decisionmaking, vhich is consistent with the Organic Law of the Central Bank
(October 10, 1990) requiring Bank policymaking to consider the economic views of
the Government. That law aiso granted the Central Bank substantial autonomy,
thus removing the large number of Bank economic analysts from the control of the
Finance Minister.
66.         The Central Bank has principal responsibility for determining the
money supply, setting policies, and carrying out internal credit and foreign
exchange operations, financing banks and other financial institutions, and
participating in framing (with the approval of the Ministry of Finance) and
signing accords with international financial institutions. The Central Bank has
a decisionmaking Council of five members. The Minister of Finance participates
in meetings but has no vote; the Minister can temporarily (for 15 days) suspend
non-unanimous actions of the Council.
67.         The Ministry of Economy is responsible for commercial and business
policy (including ensuring competitive markets), foreign investment policy
(shared with the Ministry of Finance), natural monopoly regulation (including
pricing policies), export promotion, public enterprise policies (shared with
other ministries), technological development, and consumer protection policies.
In addition, the Minister presides over the Productive Sectors IMC.   The
importance of this Ministry has declined over the past two decades as most public
enterprises have been privatized and markets have been deregulated.
68.         The Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) has the role of evaluating
investment projects, maintaining the Project Data Bank (comprising over 40,000
projects), and coordinating bilateral financing of all development and social
fund projects. MIDEPLAN does not set priorities or recommend projects; it only
approves or disapproves them. The Ministry of Finance makes final decisions
regarding investment priorities.
69.         Problems--Ministry of Finance.  The 1990 law granting the Central
Bank autonomy left the Ministry of Finance without the capacity to provide
independent analyses and economic projections to the Minister, who plays the lead
role in setting fis-al and trade policies. For example, the Minister serves as
President of the Macroeconomic Interministerial Committee, and the Ministry's
s4;aff also has the responsibility to support that CW_mittee.   As a result of
this lack of analytic capacity, the Minister lacks adequate analyses of critical
issues requiring decisions (e.g., free trade arrangements with Mexico and
Venezuela; policy options for and consequences of further opening the capital
market; evaluation of proposals to permit pension funds to invest abroad) as well
as reliable projections of macroeconomic trends and predictions of the effects
of policy changes on target variables. The lack of staff and policy analyses can
result in erroneous policy decisions, delays in reacting to external shocks, and
lags in responding to external requests for information and analysis.
70.         Development of improved trade analyses is of particular interest to
the Ministry given the open nature of the economy, growing interest in regional
free-trade zones, and the fragmented nature of policymaking in this area. Of
particular urgency is the analysis of proposed trading agreements, especially in
light of Chilean free trade policy, which advocates a minimum of legal and
customs barriers to trade. Proposed trading agreements need to be analyzed in
terms of areas of interest, preferential tariff mechanisms, legislation, legal
facilities for member countries, and timing of the process. The Ministry has
satisfied the organizational requirements for providing such analyses by forming



27                           ANNEX 1
Page 27
an International Studies Unit and naming a chief of the unit, but the unit is
neither fully staffed nor does it have the required expertise in specific
analytic areas.
71.         Development of econometric models for the projection of macroeconomic
trends and the simulation of policy changes is of equally high priority to the
Ministry. Since the granting of autonomy to the Central Bank, the Ministry has
used econometric models earlier developed by economists at CIEPLAN; these models
require improvement and updating.   The Ministry has formed a Macroeconomic
Studies Unit and named a chief to be responsible for carrying out such analyses,
but the unit is neither fully staffed nor does it have the required expertise in
specific analytic areas.
72.         Planned  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance
(USSO.9 million).  The Ministry of Finance lacks several elements of policy
information consistent with its dominant role in macroeconomic policymaking and
implementation. The Ministry has identified two high priority areas for further
development--analysis of trade issues and development of econometric models for
projection and simulation. The project would finance a total of four consultants
and supporting equipment to assemble data bases and construct econometric models
to be used in the analysis of trade and macroeconomic issues. In addition, the
consultants would work with and help train mid-level analysts of the Ministry to
develop and institutionalize long-run capacity within the Ministry to undertake
future analyses of these issues and to operate and update the econometric models.
Finally, the project will finance two studies of high priority to the Ministry,
one evaluating specific trade proposals now before the Ministry and another
evaluating alternative proposals to open the capital market. The results of this
technical assistance should be impraved analyses of specific policy issues,
institutionalized capacity for trade and macroeconomic analysis, including
macroeconomic projections, and policy simulations. Organizationally, the results
of this technical assistance should be two study units with the capacity to
provide economic reports and analyses to the Minister and to respond quickly to
urgent decisionmaking demands of the Ministry.
73.           During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Ministry of
Finance will provide semiannual reports to the PCU, satisfactory to the Bank, on
indicators of physical progress and project results (see Attachment I) that the
PCU will then forward to the Bank. During negotiations agreement was reached
that the action plan for the Ministry of Finance outlined in Attachment II will
be carried out.   A condition of disbursement for the Ministry of Finance
component is the appointment of a minimum of three economists, of the six
specified in the action plan, with the equivalent of a master's degree, to each
of the International Studies and Macroeconomic Studies Units.
74.         Problems--Ministry  of Economy..    The Ministry of Economy has
significant responsibilities regarding natural monopoly regulation, market
competition, investment, export, technological development, consumer protection,
and public enterprise policies. Policies, legislation, and Ministry management
are deficient in many of these areas.  These responsibilities have gained
importance as natural monopolies have been privatized, larger firms have merged,
exports have grown to play a significant role in economic growth, and private
foreign investment plans have increased.
75.         The Ministry of Economy is currently confronted with a number of
policy and management issues in natural monopoly regulation and consumer



28                           ANNEX 1
Page 28
protection. First, the national water and sewer service (SENDOS) was converted
(with important technical assistance provided under PSM I) into twelve public
corporations, the regulation of which is specified in several laws; these laws
do not establish adequate mechanisms for the finance of new investments or the
recovery by firms of investments in rural water supply. Second, the regulation
of telecommunications pricing includes problems in setting the cost of capital,
accounting practices allocating costs to regulated and nonregulated activities,
analysis of assumptions used by firms in setting prices, and illegal provision
of cross-subsidies to high-cost sectors.  In addition, the Subsecretariat of
Telecommunications has not adequately adapted to its role in a new technological
and market environment. Third, the Superintendency of Gas and Electricity has
similarly failed to adapt to its new obligations in an environment of privatized
natural monopolies, marginal cost pricing, and market determined prices for oil
and coal. Fourth, the organizational study of the Ministry's Antitrust Division
(Fiscalia) financed under PSM I recommended that its capacity to detect and
analyze anticompetitive practices be strengthened; that recommendation remains
to be implemented. Fifth, the Consumer Protection Agency of the Ministry lacks
the requisite organization to carry out its new responsibilities adequately.
76.         Planned  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Ministry  of  Economy
(USS1.1 million). The Ministry of Economy lacks the analytic and administrative
capacity to analyze policy issues, formulate and recommend policies to the
Ministry, and provide advice to those agencies responsible for policy
implementation in natural monopoly regulation and consumer protection. Hence,
the project would finance studies to diagnose management problems and design
solutions for the Telecommunications Subsecretariat, the Electricity and Gas
Superintendency, and the Consumer Protection Agency, and will finance consultants
to analyze investment financing and water pricing for SENDOS, to analyze
regulation of telecommunications pricing for the Telecommunications Secretariat,
and to improve investigative capacity in Piscalia.
77.           During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Ministry of
Economy will provide semiannual reports to the PCU, satisfactory to the Bank, on
indicators of physical progress and project results (see Attachment I) that the
PCU will then provide to the Bank. During regotiations agreement was reached
that the action plan stated in Attachment II for the Ministry of Economy will be
carried out. To monitor overall agency performance, during negotiations agreement
was reached that the Government would collect data of substantive reorganization
carried out in the regulatory agencies under its jurisdiction and furnish to the
Bank such data commencing July 1, 1993, and by July 1 and December 31 of each
year thereafter for the life of the project.
IV. POLICY COORDINATION AND GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION
78.        Governmental functions in Chile are divided among a large number of
agencies, sometimes resulting in overlapping responsibilities.   As with all
governments, activities and policies of one agency often affect another, thereby
leading to interagency conflicts that can only be resolved through appeal to a
higher authority. That higher authority is frequently the President. The high
opportunity cost of the President's time requires that mechanisms be developed
to avoid such conflicts. The mechanism adopted by the military government was
to create two super-ministries (Finance and Interior) with the power to decide
interministerial issues. Democratic governments often adopt less hierarchical



29                           ANNEX 1
Page 29
mechanisms, and Chile has opted for Inter-Ministerial Committees (IMCs),
established by Presidential decree on May 15, 1990, and coordinated overall by
the Division of Interministerial Coordination of the Secretariat of the
Presidency.
79.         Organization of the INCs.  The five ministerial level IMCs (Policy,
Economic, Socio-Economic, Infrastructure, and Productive Sector) established in
Chile complement at least thirty-two other interagency co mittees, including the
IMC on the Environment, the latter of which will be strengthened under a proposed
Bank institutional development loan for the environment now under preparation.
Most other interagency committees in the Government have participation below the
ministerial level.
80.         Each of the five IMCs is comprised of 10-12 permanent members,
including several ministers. Each IMC has a presiding minister and an executive
secretary appointed by that minister; the respective executive secretary and the
technical secretary of the Division of Interministerial Coordination (DIMC) also
attend all meetings. Currently, the IMCs have no permanent staff support. The
presiding ministers for the five IMCs are:   Policy (Minister of Interior),
Economic (Minister of Finance), Socio-Economic (Minister of Finance),
Infrastructure (Minister of Public Works), and Productive Sector (Minister of
Economy). Membership on the IMCs is as follows: Policy (Ministers of Interior,
Foreign Relations, Defense, Justice, Secretary General of the Government, and
Secretariat of the Presidency);   Economic (Ministers of Finance, Planning,
Economy, Labor, and Director of the Budget); Socio-Economic (Ministers of
Finance,  Labor,   Planning,  Education,  Health,  Housing  and  Urbanism);
Infrastructure (Ministers of Public Works, Planning, Transportation, Housing and
Urbanism, and National Assets, and President of National Energy Commission, and
Vice-President of CORFO); Productive Sector (Ministers of Economy, Agriculture,
and Mining, and Vice President of CORFO). The frequency of meetings varies
between weekly and monthly, depending on the IMC. The wide membership of the
IMCa facilitates discussion and agreement on the basis of objective facts and
analyses; failure of the IMCs might lead to more personalized and political
decisionmaking.
81.         Problems.  The IMCs are likely to fail if participants find them to
be inefficient decisionmaking mechanisms that produce uninformed debate with few
tangible outcomes. Periodic attendance by the President and regular attendance
by ministers to date has ensured effective functioning of the Committees, but the
failure to prepare adequately background documents and to follow up on decisions
could jeopardize the long-run success of some IMCs.
82.         To the extent possible, the IMCs depend on the staff of participating
ministries to prepare information and analyses for IMC debate and decision. Some
issues, however, require specialized expertise or personnel resources not
available in any ministry. In this situation, the IMCs, which have no budget and
no independent capacity to contract for studies, lack the information required
for informed coordination and decisionmaking.   The result may be incorrect
decisions or failure to decide or coordinate.
83.         Planned Technical Assistance (USS0.8 million).  The PPF financed
administrative assistance to the IMCs to improve IMC functioning during a time
of tight budgetary restrictions and to prepare proposals for studies required to
inform interministerial decisionmaking. The project would finance several high
priority studies required to inform Committee debates; the results of these



30                           ANNEX I1
Page 30
studies would result in improved ministerial coordination and improved government
performance. The technical assistance to be provided and the responsible DMC and
its lead ministry:  (a) a study of Government information policy, leading to
recommendations for processes and policies to ensure ccmpatible computer systems
and to avoid costly duplication (e.g., in establishing regional networks) (Policy
IMC, Interior Ministry); (b) studies of poverty and efficiency in targeting
social sector services on the poor, using data from the two most recent household
surveys conducted by MIDEPLAN (Socioeconomic IMC, Ministry of Finance);
(c) studies to modernize public sector management practices in the mining sector
and to evaluate the Government's role and alternatives for providing geographic
information (Productive Sectors IMC, Ministry of Economy); and (d) a study to
evaluate alternative policy proposals to relax restrictions on private pension
funds (FPs) investments (Economic IMC, Ministry of Finance).
84.        During negotiations agreement was reached that the IMCs will provide
semiannual reports to the PCU satisfactory to the Bank on indicators of physical
progress and project results (see Attachment I) that the PCU will then provide
to the Bank. During negotiations agreement was reached that the action plan for
the IMCs outlined in Attachment II will be carried out.
V. PROJECT COORDINATING UNIT
85.         A PPF Coordinating Unit (CU) was established under the Subsecretary
of the Ministry of Finance, with funding under the PPF, and a full-time Project
Coordinator was appointed in October 1990. Such CU is responsible for overall
project supervision and coordination with participating agencies; approval of
terms of reference (TORs) and bidding documents; management of consultant
contracts and equipment procurement with the Contraloria; ensuring all Bank
Guidelines are followed in consultant contracting and procurement; preparing
semiannual and annual project reports for the Bank; and facilitating Bank
supervision of the project.   A  Project Coordinating Unit  (PCU) will be
established to continue to carry out these responsibilities for the life of the
project. To carry out these tasks requires a PCU head experienced in project
management; long-run consultants to monitor project activities; and short-run
consultants for specialized purposes, including development of bidding documents.
86.         Planned Technical Assistance to the Proiect Coordinating Unit (USS0.3
million). Since (i) coordination of PSM II is not a regular staff function in
the Ministry of Finance and (ii) adequate coordination and supervision of the
project is essential to its success, financing for the PCU (chief, short-run and
long-run consultants, office equipment) will be shared by the Government and the
Bank. Total PCU costs are expected to be larger in the first and second years
of the project than in succeeding years, and the proposed funding varies
accordingly.
SECTION B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
87.         Prosect Organization and Implementation. The loan would be managed
by the Subsecretary of the Ministry of Finance, who would serve as Project
Director and be advised by the Subsecretaries of the Secretariat of the President
and the Ministry of Economy in those areas relevant to those two ministries



31                           ANNEX 1
Page 31
(technical assistance to the IMCs and the Ministry of Economy, *espectively).
A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) reporting to the Subsecretary of Finance will
be established to oversee project implementation. The PCU will be staffed by a
full-time Project Coordinator with the support of short-run and long-run
consultants. The PCU vill have responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the
project.  The PCU will be responsible for contracting, in consultation with
counterparts in the implementing agencies, consultants and studies and equipment
purchases provided to the Ministries of Finance, Economy, Labor, and Interior and
the Interministerial Committees under the project as vell as ensuring that
contracting by the Congress Coordinating Unit (CCU) of consultants and studies
and equipment purchases for tile Congress follow Bank guidelines. The PCU will
be responsible for arranging all disbursements through the Ministry of Finance;
all contracting will follow Bank Guidelines. The PCU will be responsible for
clearing all terms of reference, bidding documents, and consultant selections
with the Bank and will be directly responsible for supervising the implementation
of the Financial Management, Economic Policy Formulation and Analysis, and Policy
Coordination and Government Organization components. The CCU will be responsible
for maintaining the accounts and supervising the implementation of the
Legislative Information and Analysis for Economic Policy component. The PCU will
maintain project accounts and arrange for their annual audit in accordance with
Bank guidelines, prepare an annual work program, prepare a semiannual progress
report incorporating work programs and reports from all PSM II implementing
agencies, and prepare all documentation required for midterm reviews of the
project to occur by December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1995. Progress reports,
including documentation for  midterm reviews, would indicate the degree of
success each project component has made in attaining measures of physical
progress and agency performance.
88.         During negotiations, agreement was reached that:  (i) the PCU will
provide semiannual reports to the Bank on indicators of physical progress and
project impacts satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment I); (ii) the action
plans stated in Attachment II for participating agencies will be carried out; and
(iii) for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating overall performance of the
program, the Government would collect data and furnish measurements of agency-
level performance indicators (outlined in Attachment III) commencing July 1,
1992, and every six months thereafter for the life of the project. A condition
of project effectiveness is the eatablishment of a PCU in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank.
89.         Procurement. The goods and services to be financed under the project
would be procured in accordance with procedures consistent with Bank guidelines
for procurement. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B of the
Memorandum of the President. Purchases of equipment, supplies, and maintenance
items the equivalent of US$25,000 or less up to a maximum of US$500,000 and
bibliographic collections for the Congress component would be made through
shopping under procedures acceptable to the Bank; above US$25,000 but less than
US$250,000 up to a maximum of US$6,100,000 they would be made through Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank; above US$250,000
they would be made through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). All ICB and
the f 1-st two LCB contracts would be subject prior review by the Bank. Most of
the equipment to be purchased is computer hardware and software; a small portion
would be used for other office equipment. In the evaluation of all contracts for
goods procured under ICB procedures, local suppliers would be granted a margin
of preference in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines (as stated in
Appendix 2 of the May 1985 Bank Guidelines). All procurement will be coordinated



32                           ANNEX 1
Page 32
through the PCU with the project participating/beneficiary entities responsible
for preparing bidding documents and participating in bid evalua%ions.
90.            Consultant services would be procured in accor6snce with Bank
Guidelines. To reduce delays in contracting with consultants, the Government has
issued a Presidential decree delegating to the Subsecretary of Finance the
signing of World Bank financed consultant and consultant firm contracts of less
than 90 days with expenditures less than US$4,500 per month.
91.         Disbursements and Ref inancina. The loan will refinance a PPF granted
August 1990 in the amount of US$376,000 for expenditures incurred under the PPF
prior to loan signing, expected by October 1991.  This amount is to finance
project preparation and initial implementation activities and the start of PCU
activities.   The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against:   l00% of
expenditures for foreign and local consultants, training, foreign expenditures
on equipment, ex-factory local expenditures on equipment; and 78% of expenditures
on locally purchased imported equipment. The salary of the coordinator of the
Congress component will be financed on a declining basis consisting of 100% of
expenditures until December 31, 1992; 50% of expenditures until December 31,
1993; and 25% of expenditures until December 31,  1994.   A condition of
disbursement for the Internal Revenue Service and Customs components is the
appointment of subproject component coordinators satisfactory to the Bank. A
condition of disbursement for the Ministry of Finance component is the
appointment of key staff in the International Studies Unit and the Macroeconomic
Studies Unit. Conditions of disbursement for the Congress component are the
appointment of a subproject component coordinator satisfactory to the Bank and
an agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Congress setting forth their
respective responsibilities in this project component under terms satisfactory
to the Bank. Except for contracts requiring prior review, disbursement would be
made against statements of expenditure (SOE), for which detailed documentation
eviJencing expenditures would be reviewed by the PCU and made available for the
required audit and also for review by the Bank supervi:ion missions. To expedite
disbursements, a Special Account would be opened in the Central Bank, or in a
commercial bank satisfactory to the Bank, with an initial deposit of up to
US$750,000 to cover three months of average disbursements.   The project
completion date is December 31, 1997, and the project closing date is June 30,
1998.
92.         The Government's  contribution  of approximately US$6.8 million
equivalent would consist of counterpart staff, local consultants, office space,
supplies, secretarial services, and vehicle operation.
93.         Accounts and Audits.   Separate accounts would be kept for all
expenditures made under the project. The PCU would maintain records and accounts
for all project activities excepting the Legislative Inrormation and Analysis for
Economic Policy component, for which the CCU would maintain records and accounts.
The project accounts and SOEs would be audited each year by auditors acceptable
to the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Auditing Guidelines. The audit reports
would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of the
financial year.
