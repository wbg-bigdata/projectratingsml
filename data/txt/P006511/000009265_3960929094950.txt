PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
rocrowotra     Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES)
UneftacAriest BRDES and Private Financial Intermediaries
Vuarantor:     The Federative Republic of Brazil
Amouts         US$300 million equivalent
S rzs          Repayment in 15 years, including five years of grace, with
Interest at the Bank's standard variable rate
fwsm8t         Bank funds will be on-lent according to BNDES' standard lending
policies. On BNDES' domestic resources, terms range from 2 to 12
years with an average of 8 years. The interest rate charged by
BNDES in 1990 ranges from 9Z-12Z p.a. over IPC (monetary
correction) with an average in 1989 of 10.52 p.a. On BNDES'
Foreign Exchange resources terms range from 2 to 12 years with an
average of 8 years. The interest rate charged by BNDES is
equivalent to the cost of BNDES' basket of foreign currencies
(BIDES' foreign currency pooling system) plus a 2? spread
representing credit risk and administration fees.
Po1iect
Obiectivess    The objectives of this operation are to support BNDES' efforts to
reorient its focus to the private sector and reduce its exposure
to the public sector; to reduce credit segmentation; and to
strengthen its credit policies and procedures. The loan will
accomplish these objectives bys (a) ensuring that BNDES
continues to increase the proportion of lending to private sector
borrowers in its total lending, and that its operations through
financial intermediaries are undertaken increasingly and
predominantly through private sector intermediaries; (b)
supporting BNDES' reorganization which is designed to reduce
BIDES' directed credit lines and to finance financially an4
economically sound projects; and (c) strengthening BNDES' credit,
planning, and audit departments.
Prolect
plAgtions   The loan will finance technically, financially and economically
justified private investments without regard to sector, region or
company sitze. This loan will not be a directed line of credit.
The investment projects will be presented to BNDES either by
private Investors or by private financial Intermediaries
representing investors. 'When requesting Bank financing, BNDES



will submit a subprojectl appraisal report that the Bank vill
evaluate prior to approving the commitment of funds. When
submitting subprojects to the Bank, BNDES will include its
assessment of whether the firm or financial intermediary meets
BNDES' creditworthiness criteria. BNDES will pass on co its
borrowers the full cost of IBRD funds including the foreign
exchange risk plus a spread. The loan will have a technical
assistance component not to exceed US$1.0 million equivalent for
(1) the Credit Departament for training to improve its policies
and procedures; (2) the Planning Department to support its
program to develop indicators of competitiveness; and (3) the
Audit Department to develop the capability and procedures for
operational-performance auditing.
BNDES could commit up to US$150 million of the loan for
subprojects in the first 12 months after loan effectiveness. At
that time, the Bank will review BNDES' performance over the past
12 months, and next 12 months' plans in accordance with agreed
criteria. If found satisfactory, the balance of the loan would
be available for commitment. Loan funds that were not fully
committed by the end of the next 12 months will become available
for commitment after the Bank's review of BNDES' performance and
the following year's plans. The criteria to be used to review
BNDES' performance and plans are: (a) the BNDES system will
reduce its flow of credit to public sector borrowers from 36? and
27? in 1988 and 1989 to 23? and 19? in 1990 and 1991,
respectively. In 1992, BNDES will limit the flow of credit to
the public sector to no more than the 1991 levels; (b) the BNDES
system will steadily reduce the participation of public financial
intermediaries in allocating the resources BNDES disburses
through financial intermediaries, from 58? and 50? in 1988 and
1989 to 45? and 402 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1992,
BNDES will limit the public financial intermediaries'
participation to no more than the 1991 levels; and (c) the spread
between BNDES' yearly average cruzeiro lending rates and its
average cruzeiro borrowing rates should provide a margin
sufficient to cover all its costs, prudent risk provisioning, and
normal profits. In 1989 this spread was about four percentage
points. In addition, the BNDES system will establish a credit
policy including (i) overall credit limits for financial
intermediaries (by the end of 1990) and (ii) policies and
procedures for determining creditworthiness and parameters for
setting individual credit limits for companies that deal directly
with BNDES (no later than 12 months after Loan Effectiveness).
Proiect
Benefits:      The shift in BNDES' lending from the public to the private sector
is expected to result in an additional US$1.1 billion in finance
for the private sector from 1990 to 1992. By implementing a
creditworthiness policy and by Increasing the participation of
the private sector, the project will improve the allocation of
BNDES' resources towards profitable investments and allow
1/ "Subproject* refers to a project of BNDES' borrowers.



economically desirable industries to emerge or expand nationwide.
BNDES would be strengthened as a financial institution by its
increased private sector orientation and the quality of its
assets would be improved.
Proiect
Risks:         Even though aggregate domestic demad may fall as a result of the
Government's new economic policies, it is likely that demand for
investment credit will be strong for two reasonst (1) firms will
reorient production for export markets and (2) firms will face
competition from imports as a result of trade liberalization. To
meet these challenges, Brazilian industry will need to modernize
its industrial plant. Since this loan will finance imported
machinery and equipment, there will be strong demand for the
proceeds of this loan.

I. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. The Structure and Size of the Financial Sector
1.01     The Brazilian financial sector is developed and diversified.1  It
is a mixed system in which large federal financial institutions operate
alongside public commer -A1 and development banks, and a more flexible and
profitable private fin. cial system. In the late 19806, the equity of the
Brazilian banking system was US$24 billion, and total assets were US$244
billion. Of these assets, US$116 billion were held by the federal banks,
US$29 billion were held by state banks, and US$99 billion were held by
private banks.
1.02     The financial sector has three levelst  the monetary authorities;
second tier official banks; and banking and non-banking financial
institutions. Overall policy for the financial sector is determined by the
National Monetary Council, now part of the Ministry of Economy. The second
tier official banks provide the bulk of investment finance and agricultural
credit. Included at the third level are (a) commercial banks, which mostly
lend short term credit but also onlend long-term credi. -om the federal
banks; (b) investment banks, which lend for working capital, onlend long-
term credit, and assist larger clients in the capital markets; and (c)
state and regional development banks, which lend mostly to the public
ector. This structure is depicted graphically in Annex 1.
1.03     Within the Brazilian Fin&ncial sector there are four second-tier
official banks of which BNDES is one. The following chart summarizes
aggregated market shares of public and private banks:

1.04     BNDES is a major player in the Brazilian financial sectog.  Its
assets represent 25 of the assets of federally owned banks and 122 of
total asset3 of the Brazilian banking system. Moreover BNDES' equity
represents 462 of the total equity of federally owned banks and 252 of
total equity of the Brazilian banking system. At present BNDES is the main
source of long-term investment credit in Brazil and the largest development
bank in Brazil with annual disbursements of about US$4.5 billion.
B. Financial Sector Issues
1.05     The issues affecting the sector includes  a recent history of very
high and variable inflation rates; no market long-term lending rates;
limited access to external borrowing; a multitade of reserve requirements
on demand deposits; a regulation barring banks from paying interest on
demand deposits; poor information disclosure, prudential regulations and
supervisory practices; government-administered deposit interest rates;
deposit insurance system limited to savings and loans institutions; and
government direction and subsidization of much of total credit. Entry into
the banking system was also limited by 'licenses" which could be bought
only from a bank of similar size which was leaving the market. The
institution-specific issues include: thin and highly volatile capital
markets that are poorly regulated; a large and financially distressed state
banking system; a highly subsidized housing finance system; and a large
federal development bank whose past practices encouraged an inefficient
allocation of resources.
1.06     These and other distortions prevented the Brazilian financial
system from efficiently performing the saving-investment intermediation
process. The issues noted above hindered monetary control, amplified
macroeconomic imbalances, segmented financial markets, adversely affected
resources allocated to the financial system, and may have contributed to
regressive income distribution.
C. Obiectives of Financial Reform
1.07     The objective of financial reform is to integrate financial
markets to ensure efficient intermediation of funds and low transaction
costs so that differences in interest rates mainly would reflect time
preferences and risks perceived by the market. Achieving this broad
objective involves (i) reducing credit segmentation and government
interference in credit markets; (ii) increasing banking competition and
financial intermediation efficiency; (iii) improving transparency and
information disclosure; (iv) strengthening prudential regulations and the
Central Bank's supervision practices; and (v) enhancing financial stability
and monetary control.
D. Bank Strategy in the Financial Sector
1.08     Given the breadth and complexity of the Brazilian financial
sector, the Bank has adopted a broad and flexible strategy based on
different instruments to address different issues. In Brazil, a single
financial sector adjustment loan could not capture all the desirable policy
reforms, even if they could be implemented within one period.
Consequently, the Bank has adopted a strategy of progressive movement
towards the final goal by developing investment loans that complement



- 3 -
adjustment lending. Such investment lending would be conditional on
sectoral or institutional policy changes to reduce the distortions in the
system. Our strategy would ensure that the changes in the financial sector
continue to evolve along the lines of the Bank's objectives for the sector.
The policy changes would include phasing out directed lines of credit in
favor of general credit to private enterprises.
1.09     This approach has been adopted in Loans 2960-BR and 2971-BR, the
"Agriculture Credit Project' and the "Fourth Agro-Industry Loan," which
have explicit conditions to ensure that loans from Bank funds are (i) non-
directed and (ii) fully cover the costs of financing. This loan to BNDES
is designed to continue reforms along the same lines.
1.10     In addition to the projects already undertaken, the Bank and the
government are developing a privatization-capital markets project that
addresses the portfolio restructuring of BNDESPAR and policy and
institutional weaknesses of the securities subsector; and the private
sector finance loan, which supports reforms of BNDES and is the subject of
this report. These projects will reduce government intervention in the
financial system and improve the efficiency of financial intermediation.
E. Progress on Financial Sector Reform
1.11     The government has implemented several measures to address the
major financial sector issues. The government, in consultation with the
World Bank, initiated in 1988 a series of institutional and economic
reforms in the financial sector in conjunction with a proposed financial
sector reform loan. The negotiation of this loan was postponed in 1989 due
to Brazil's unstable macroeconomic environment. Currently, the Bank is
awaiting government decision on whether to continue further discussions of
financial sector adjustment lending. Nonetieless, the government has
implemented many of the reforms of the loan which was heavily front-loaded
with policies.
1.12     The strategy of the government, with which the Bank concurs, is to
undertake reforms in phases. The first phase focused on eliminating
certain official directed and subsidized credit programs, increasing
competition in the banking system by easing entry restrictions and reducing
institutional segmentation, improving transparency, and strengthening
banking regulations and supervisory practices. Annex II of this report
lists the areas where changes have been made, the specifics of the changes,
and our assessment of the extent to which the measures meet the concerns
that they are designed to address. This phase of reform is the first major
step in eliminating policy-induced market distortions.
1.13     The economic plan of the newly elected government, the "Plano Novo
Brasil," introduced on March 15, 1990, is a stabilization plan with
important elements of medium-term structural reform. Major components of
the program are: contracting the supply of money by freezing overaight
money, savings accounts and demand deposits; increasing the tax base;
temporarily freezing private sector prices and increasing public-sector
prices; floating the exchange rate and liberalizing foreign trade; and
undertaking a privatization program.



- 4 -
1.14     From the changes announced in the financial sector, it is clear
that the present government intends to carry forward, even more vigorously,
the financial reforms initiated by the previous administration. Besides
the measures related to the financial sector noted above, the goverm! ent
has reduced the multitude of reserve requirement for Banks and has lowered
the reserve ratios. From 42 different reserve requirements averaging 51S
prior to the ONovo Brasil' plan, there are now 16 reserve requirements
averaging 271. Unifying reserve requirements has been an important
objective of the Bank's dialogue with Brazil. In addition to this, the
government is rontinuing to make significant changes in the rules and
regulations governing the financial securities market such as allowing
firms to issue commercial paper, and setting up an independent sett'ement
and custody agent for securities. These actions not only demonstrate a
continued commitment to financial sector reforms but also facilitate the
goals and objectives of this loan.
1.15     While the agenda for further financial reform remains long, the
Government is committed to continue implementing such reforms. The complex
nature of financial sector problems, the need to proceed with a
comprehensive reform program, and the political and technical restrictions
to its implementation make a gradual approach necessary. A particular area
for reform is in directed credit from earmarked sources of funda and
government- administered, long-term interest rates. Further areas of
reform include: continuing dismantling barriers to entee the banking
system for foreign banks; facilitating exit of insolvent financial
institutions by establishing a deposit insurance fund; improving bankruptcy
procedures; and improving capital adequacy requirements for the banking
system.
F. The Relationship between the Project and the Financial Sector Strategy
1.16     The proposed Private Sector Finance Loan addresses institution-
specific reforms that have a positive impact on the financial sector and
the overall economy. These reforms are better addressed by an investment
loan rath_.: than an adjustment loan because, by lending to the institution
which is responsible for implementing the reforms, the Bank has a more
direct dialogue regarding the policy reform program.
1.17     BND?S' reforms are fully consistent with the government's
objectives for the financial sector. As BNDES plays a leading role in the
financial sector, its reforms will have a significant and welcome impact on
the way long-term credit is allocated in Brazil. Reforms that improve the
efficiency of financial intermediation include: (i) passing on to the
final user the full cost of foreign exchange risk associated with foreign
borrowings; (ii) increasing lending rates in real terms from 72 in 1985 to
10.5Z in 1989 to provide a margin sufficient to cover all costs, prudent
risk provisioning, and normal profits; (iii) increasing the discretion of
private financial intermediaries in allocating BNDES' funds; and (iv)
improving the quality of BNDES; lending portfolio. Reforms that reduce
government interference in credit markets focus primarily on (i)
redirecting BNDES' lending from the public to the private sector; (ii)
establishing a credit policy to evaluate the creditworthiness of public and
private borrowers based on the same standards; and (iii) reducing credit
segmentation by eliminating lines of credit that were directed by region,
sector, size of enterprise, and purpose of investment.



- 5 -
1.18     Tte Bank's support for BNDES' policy reforms is a signal to the
Federal Government and to BINDES management that we endorse the reforms and
wish to continue the dialogue on financial sector reforms. The Bank's
involvement with BNDES strengthens its efforts to steer away from past
practices. BNDES's recent policy reorientation and the Bank's current
involvement are indicative of an evolving BNDES which could play a useful
financial role in the medium-term transition towards a competitive ma:ket-
oriented financial system in Brazil as envisaged in the Bank's strategy for
financial reform. Our involvement will encourage BNDES to maintain its
private sector orientation, credit policy and lending rates which more than
cover its costs of borrow3ug. These costs include the hedging of its
foreign borrowing. The Government is still in the process of defining
BNDES' role in the financial sector. It appears the mosf likely direction
will be to increase its second-tier banking activities, _o restrict its
direct lending to large operations undertaken in consortia with private
banks, and to coordinate as well as mobilize foreign financial and
technical support for Brazil's privatization program.
1.19     These changes are consistent with the Bank's strategy for the
fin;ncial sector. The proposed loan also is consistent with the
recomendations of the Financial Sector Operations Task Force in that it
will (1) reduce total directed credit to state-owned enterprises by
increasing sectorally untied long term credit to private enterprises; (2)
reduce interest rate subsidies for much of BNDES resources by ensuring that
(a) BNDES' interest rates are higher than its cost of borrowing and (b) the
Bank's funds will be loaned at their cost, includir.g the foreign exchange
risk, plus the cost of intermediation; (3) support economically,
financially and technically justified private investments; (4) increase the
role of private financial intermediaries in the distribution of term credit
and reduce the role of official banks; (5) improve the quality of BNDES
future lending portfolio by reducing thc stock of public sector loans and
establishing an independent credit policy; and (6) improve the quality of
BNDES' past lending portfolio by ensuring that BNDES agrees on a plan of
action of settle delinquent loans and arrears in the context of the
government's privatization program, which BNDES is leading.
G. Previous Bank Operations with BNDES
1.20     The Bank has had three development banking loans with BNDES.  The
most recent was a US$300 million Third Development Banking Loan (No.
2488-BR) on January 10, 1985. This loan provided funds to private
industrial enterprises mainly to support exports. Its major policy
achievement is that it established procedures for project evaluation
including incorporating economic analysis into the evaluation of projects.
The procedures are followed for every mid- and large-size project which
BNDES finances. The loan is fully committed and, as of May 31, 1990, 95S
disbursed. The closing date is December 31, 1990. A Completion Report for
the Third Development Banking Project is scheduled for November 1990. On
December 21, 1982 the Bank approved a Second Development Banking Project
Loan for US$220 million (No. 2225-BR). This project financed mainly smal'
and medium enterprises through state and regional barks.  The loan was   I
fully disbursed in August 1985. The First Development Banking Project Loan



- 6 -
(No. 1206-BR) for US$85 million, financed small and medium scale
enterprises and was signed March 1, 1976. The loan was never fully
committed mainly because BNDES' lending programs for small and medium
enterprise during 1976-1980 carried negative interest rates. The Bank
resumed its lending relationship with BNDES after it had eliminatel
negative lending rates and reduced lending subsidies. For information on
BNDES' current interest rate policy see paras. 2.23-2.28. The balance of
the loan account was cancelled in 1980 after only 37Z of it had been
disbursed.
II. THE NATIONAL BANK FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (BNDES)
A. Backaround
2.01     The BNDES system, with average annual disbursements of roughly
US$4.5 billion a year. is the main source for long-term investment credit
in Brazil. It is also one of the principal federal financial institutions.
The BNDES system comprises BNDES and its two subsidiaries, FINAME and
BNDESPAR. FINAME is the means through which BNDES provides financing for
the machinery and equipment component of its clients' projects.3 BNDESPAR
supports the capitalization of Brazilian enterprises by participating
directly as a shareholder and by financing the purchase of capital issues
by other investors. BNDES was established in 1952 as a government
institute under the Ministry of Finance to manage special funds. In 1971,
BNDES became a federal public company subordinated to the Ministry of
Planning. In the 19709, government intervention in BNDES' lending
decisions was at times quite strong. However, since the 19809, the
government has not involved itself in BNDES' daily lending decisions.
These decisions are left entirely to BNDES' management. For detailed
information on the institutional aspects of BNDES, see Annex 3; for a list
of selected documents and data available in the Project Files, see Annex 4.
BNDES operates in many activities and areas of the economy. The full scope
of its operations is given in Annex 5.
2.02     Throughout its history, until its most recant strategic plan,
BNDES' objectives were guided by import substitution. When BNDES was first
created, its objectives were to support the government's efforts to develop
key sectors of the economy, to supply resources for priority undertakings
for national development, and to stimulate private and public investment.
Its operations were heavily oriented toward financing public sector
projects in power, transportation and basic industries, especially steel.
Later on, BNDES broadened its lending activities by increasing its term
lending to private industry for manufacturing, capital goods, and export
development. Most recently it has financed private energy projects.
2.03     BNDES' increased experience with the private sector and the stark
realities of public sector finance have resulted in BNDES restructuring
itself to better serve the needs of private sector borrowers. BNDES'
fundamental objective for 1988-1992 is to competitively integrate Brazil's
markets with those of the jlobal economy, which represents a significant
departure from import substitution. To accomplish this objective, BNDES in
mid-1989 underwent a sweeping reorganization which featured policy reforms.
3/ FINAME is staffed with engineers who have the technical capabilities to
oversee the procurement of machinery and equipment.



- 7 -
The reforms reflect a major change in BNDES' orientation to the market.
The principal changes are in the following areast
Private Sector Orientation -- BNDES is shifting its lending away
from the public sector toward the private sector;
Credit Policy -- BNDES is evaluating and establishing lending
limits that reflect the intrinsic creditworthiness of its
borrowers and financial intermediaries;
Resource Mobilization and Interest Rates -- ENDES is 1) obtaining
resources in the capital markets, both domestically and abroad;
and 2) ensuring that, through its lending rates, it is continuing
to pass on to its borrowers the full cost of intermediation,
including the foreign exchange risk;
Increased Profitability and Portfolio Quality -- BNDES is 1)
profitably transferring to private ownership the companies which
are controlled by BNDES and BNDESPAR; and 2) settling delinquent
public sector loans in the context of Brazil's privatization
program, which BNDES is leading;
Directed Credit -- BNDES is 1) reducing its segmentation of
credit; and 2) increasing the discretion financial institutions
have in intermediating BNDES' funds.
Increased Emphasis on Lending Effectiveness -- BNDES is 1)
developing indicators of international competitiveness which it
will use to evaluate key local industries. These indicators will
be incorporated into BNDES' planning and project analysis
activities; and 2) expanding the activities of its audit
department from accounting to operational performance audit. The
goal is to ensure that BNDES' operational policies and procedures
maximize revenue and minimize costs.
B. Private Sector Orientation
2.04     In the past, BNDES, like many development banks, followed the
priorities of the federal government and lent predominantly to the public
sector. Today, BNDES has considerable latitude in conducting its business
within SEPLAN's general policy guidance. Given the poor financial
condition of many public sector borrowers, BNDES has sought new ways to
stimulate the participation of the private sector in its operations. The
following table shows how BNDES has strikingly oriented its operations away
from the public sector toward the private sector throughout the 1980s.
2.05     BNDES now adheres to several policies and regulations which enable
its management to select and finance good projects, most of them in the
private sector, and to reduce the government's intervention in its lending
decisions. These are: 1) employing methodology for rigorous project
analysis; 2) reducing operations with public sector borrowers because of
their generally poor financial condition; and 3) following procedures for
evaluating the creditworthiness of and establishing credit eligibility
criteria for BNDES' borrowers and financial intermediaries.

2.06     As a result of its growing private sector orientation, BNDES is
changing the way it operates to be more responsive to private sector
borrowers. It is developing new financial products that will provide
faster response time to client proposals, improve financial return, and
thus improve BNDES' internal generation of funds. These new products will
be offered to private firms which BNDES has judged to be completely
creditworthy. The creditworthiness analysis will be done by BNDES' newly
established credit department (para. 2.09). To these firms BNDES will make
available either directly or through financial intermediaries lines of
credit for potentially recurring financial needs of relatively small
monetary size and term. The lines of credit will be implemented in early
1990 and their prospects for acceptance appear to be strong. For further
information on lending rates refer to para. 2.23.
2.07     BNDES' strategic plan envisages continuing this new private sector
orientation. In fact, its budget plans that at least 81Z of disbursements
by 1991 will go to private sector borrowers. Compared with BNDES' record
of the early 1980s, when only 312 of its disbursements went to the pri7ate
sector, this is a distinct change in direction from its traditional
practices. From 1989 to 1991, this is expected to shift about US$1.1
billion in incremental lending to the private sector.
C. Credit Policy
2.08     From its growing experience with the private sector, BNDES needed
an independent credit policy so it could base lending eligibility decisions
on a borrowers' inherent creditworthiness. This is a significant departure
from its normal practices when BNDES essentially operated without its own
credit policy. In the past, private sector lending decisions were based
more on project viability and borrower guarantees than the borrower's
creditworthiness. When lending to public sector financial intermediaries,
or to public sector enterprises, BNDES depended on the Central Bank and
SEPLAN for their judgment on the creditworthiness of these public sector
institutions. Thus, when lending to state-owned enterprises or state



- 9 -
banks, BNDES often accepted the government's guarantee in lieu of
determining the creditworthiness of its clients. If BNDES' management did
not want to lend to a goverment-owned borrower, it could only base i'8
refusal on project-specific grounds. As a result, BNDES, in the 19509
through the 19709, placed between 601 to 80S of its resources with public
enterprises and banks. When these borrowers were unable to repay the
loans, the government had to make good on its guarantees or BNDES had to
roll over the loans.
2.09     Accustomed to basing its lending decisions primarily on the
viability of the investment project and the availability of collateral in
the form of real property and guarantees, BNDES needed a new organizational
unit to incorporate the evaluation of creditworthiness. In 2id-1989, BNDES
established a Credit Department to evaluate and establish lending limits
that reflect the intrinsic creditworthiness of borrowers and financial
intermediaries. BNDES expects its creditworthiness determination to reduce
credit risk, so its project analysts can concentrate on project risk. It
is also likely to reduce BNDES' lending to the public sector, given that
many public sector enterprises are not creditworthy.
2.10     The objective of the credit department is to limit exposure to
individual borrowers, groups of borrowers, and sectors as well as to
establish controls to ensure that the limits are observed. BNDES' credit
department is organized so that two separate divisions evaluate the
creditworthiness of companies and of financial intermediaries. A summary
of the analytical criteria used for both groups is presented in the
paragraphs below. More information is provided in the Project Files.
2.11     BNDES is in the process of developing its criteria for evaluating
the creditworthiness of companies.  Currently, and as a first step, BNDES
is identifying companies that either have been or presently are active
customers of BNDES and which are consistently profitable and have a low
indebtedness. These companies will then be ranked based on the points
assigned to various quantitative and qualitative factors. This analysis
essentially determines which companies are eligible for receiving BNDES
credit. The next step will be to establish policies and procelures to
determine creditworthiness and parameters for setting individual credit
limits for new prospective clients of BNDES.
2.12     BNDES has limited experience in evaluating the creditworthiness of
companies, but in its early stages it is adhering to international
standards. To ensure that the program continues on the right track, BNDES
has requested technical assistance to support them in developing a credit
analysis training program. The training program would emphasize 1)
minimizing exposure by company, sector, and product; 2) managing risk; and
3) creating a credit policy manual. The details of this technical
assistance program is provided in para. 3.06 and Annex 6.
2.13     To diversify the risk of credit operations undertaken through
financial intermediaries, BNDES has established minimum eligibility
requirements and risk limits for them. The minimum eligibility
requirements establish which financial intermediaries are eligible to
channel BNDES' funds. The credit limits establish the intermediaries'
financial capacity to obtain additional funding from BNDES. The credit
policies and procedures are also observed by FINAME, which works



- 10 -
exclusively through financial intermediaries. Utilizing a point system for
the purpose of ranking financial intermediaries, BNDES has labelled most of
the intermediaries either preferred, acceptable, or unacceptable. Based on
the ranking mechanism, BNDES did not extend credit to several commercial,
development, and investment banks during 1989. For eligible
intermediaries, BNDES establishes an overall credit limits. The
intermediaries then are assigned a working credit limit equal to their
overall credit limit minus their outstanding balance with the BNDES system.
2.14     BNDES is much farther along in implementing its credit policy for
financial intermediaries than for companies because of BNDES' long
experience in accrediting financial intermediaries. Through this process,
it has amassed information on them in its data base. Moreover, BNDES also
is accustomed to making on-site visits to its accredited financial
intermediaries to ensure that they are following BNDES lending procedures.
This experience has enabled BNDES to more quickly implement its credit
guidelines for financial intermediaries. Nevertheless, BNDES would still
benefit from credit analysis training to ensure that its policies are in
line with international practices.
D. Resource Mobilization and Interest Rates
(i) Resource Mobilization
2.15     To expand BNDES' lending capacity, the Federal Government has
earmarked, since the early seventies, part of the social insurance funds
from the PIS and PASEP programs 4 and transferred them to BNDES via Banco
do Brasil, which collects the taxes. Banco do Brasil also makes payments
to participants that benefit from these social programs as the need arises.
PIS/PASEP funds that are transferred by Banco do Brasil to BNDES are
maintained in a "trust fund' account. Whenever Banco do Brasil requires
funds to make payments to PIS/PASEP participants, it requests BNDES to
transfer the required amount to Banco do Brasil.
2.16     In the early seventies, the Federal Government transferred over
ninety percent of these funds to BNDES, the balance was used for general
budgetary purposes. As the need to finance the Federal Government's
deficit and the benefit payments to PIS/PASEP participants increased,
PIS/PASEP funds transferred to BNDES decreased drastically, in relative and
absolute terms. According to Article 239 of the 1988 Brazilian
Constitution and regulating laws passed in 1990, PIS/PASEP funds collected
since October 1988 will fund a new unemployment insurance program called
Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador (FAT). Sixty per cent of the FAT will be
used for unemployment insurance and 402 will be invested by BNDES in its
program of economic development. The following table provides a summary of
the yearly PIS/PASEF funds transferred t" BNDES since 1975:
4/ PIS ("Social Integration Program") provides lump-sum payments to non-
civil service employees upon their retirement. The resources of the
fund consists of receipts from a 15? enterprise sales tax (75t of total
PIS funds) and of direct Treasury transfers of the corporate income tax
(252 of the total). PASEP ("Public Employee's Social Insurance Fund')
is similar to PIS except that it provides coverage to civil service
employees. It is funded through a transfer of 2? of operating receipts
of each level of the government.

2.17     As of December 31, 1989, 58X of BNDES' US$29.4 billion capital
structure was composed of PISIPASEP funding; the balance was made up by
equity (22Z)t by borrowings (152) and by other liabilities (5X). Although
the yearly new transfers of PISIPASEP funds to BNDES have declined, the
accumulated PISIPASEP trust fund has increased, both in relative and
absolute terms. The following table provides a summary of BNDES' resource

a/ Sale of equity investments, fixed assets and others.
b/ FINSOCIAL are Federal government sponsored social programs (mainly
grants) which are financed by a tax of 0.52 on the gross receipts of
public and private companies, financial institutions and insurance
companies and 5? of the income taxes of public and private service
companies. BNDES has played so far a minor role in distributing these
funds on behalf of the Federal Government as it is one of many agencies
sponsoring government social projects. BNDES is a mere cash depository
of these government programs.
c/ The Merchant Marine Trust Fund finances the construction of maritime
vessels. It is funded through a 3? tax on the CIF value of imports and
a 10 tax on the import freight charges. Resources are administered by
the Ministry of Transport. BNDES' role is limited to that of a
financial intermediary.
2.19     In 1988, the net transfer of PIS/PASEP funds to BNDES, after
accounting for payments to participants, amounted to zero. BNDES'
internally generated funds, principally loan repayments, interest and
dividend income and sale of investments, has grown from about 50X in the
early 1980s to 652 in the late 19808 of its total sources of funds.
Finally, BNDES' external borrowings have fallen as the international banks
reduced lending to Brazil. To compensate for the decrease in its
traditional sources of funds, BNDES' management has successfully increased
BNDES internal cash generation by (i) increasing BNDES profitability (para.
2.30); (ii) selling equity holdings and privatizing about a dozen companies
whose stock was held by BNDESPAR; (iii) issuing in open market operations
(a) a two-year CD for the equivalent of US$100 million and (b) 18-month
commercial paper for the equivalent of US$1 billion. BNDES' CDs and
commercial paper are generally bought by pension and other retirement and
investment funds which are required to diversify their portfolios by
holding a certain percentage of their portfolio in Federal Government
longer-term instruments. This has been BNDES' first market offering since
the mid-70s at which time BNDES regularly issued long-term (two to six
years) CDs. The recent sale of medium-term instruments by BNDES signals an
important development in BNDES' treasury strategy to mobilize resources.
2.20     About 602 of BNDES sources of funds for the 1990-92 period will
come from receipts from credit operations (BNDES' borrowers loan
repayments) and other internally generated funds. BNDES estimates that net
new PIS/PASEP transfers during that period will reach about 181 of BNDES
sources of funds. These transfers are likely to be lower because
historically BNDES has received less PISIPASEP funds than were budgeted.
2.21     There has been much discussion in the Bank's financial sector work
(Report No. 7725-BR) on issues related to earmarked funds and the
distortions they create in financial markets and BNDES' dependence on these
fiscal transfers. In order to increase BNDES market orientation, the Bank
has recomvended to the Federal Government and BNDES on various occasions
that BNDES should seek more of its funding through open market operations
at competitive interest rates and that the government reduce the quantity
of the earmarked funds which BNDES administers. However, by Constitution
and regulating laws, BNDES receives 40t of PISIPASEP collections (para.
2.16). Therefore to reduce the quantity of these transfers, the



- 14 -
Constitution and laws would have to be amended. This is not likely to
happen in the near future.
(ii) Interest Rates
(a) BNDES' Borrowing Rates
2.22     Historically, BNDES has had few sources from which to borrow
domestically: the PISIPASEP trust fund and the sale of CDs and commercial
paper.5 For PIS/PASEP funds, it pays the legally established interest rate
of 62 p.a. plus monetary correction. This rate is the same as that paid on
passbook savings accounts (housing or rural), the only other major long-
term instrument. For CDs it has recently paid 92 p.a. over BTN. BNDES
issued commercial paper indexed to the US dollar at 0? interest rate.6 No
other financial instruments are available to BNDES to raise domestic
resources. Internationally, BNDES raises resources with commercial banks,
(Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, Bank of Tokyo, Mitsubishi Bank,
Commerzbank) paying international maAket rates; with bilateral agencies
like EXIMBANK (US and Japan), CIDA (Canada), KFW (West Germany) and with
multilateral agencies like IDB and the World Bank. Loans from bilateral
and multilateral agencies generally carry interest rates that are lower
than those charged by commercial banks.
(b) BNDES' Lending Rates and Terms
2.23     Through the late 1980s, BNDES increased its average local currency
lending rates for loans for which the resources are mobilized domestically,
i.e., PIS/PASEP. In 1985, its average local currency lending rate to final
beneficiaries was 71 over OTN, in 1987 it was 9? over OTN, in 1988 it was
10? over OTN, and in 1989 i,. has been 10.5? over BTN. In 1989 the interest
rate charged by BNDES ranged from 82 to 12? p.a. over BTN.7 In January
1990, BNDES again raised its minimum interest rate from 82 to 9? over IPC
(para. 2.25).
2.24     In early 1987, BNDES ended its former practice of taking most of
the foreign exchange risk of its foreign obligations and passing only some
of this risk to its customers. Since January 13, 1987 when BNDES issued
Resolution 635, all of BNDES' borrowings in foreign exchange have been
fully hedged. BNDES indexes loans to its basket of currencies which is
analogous to the World Bank currency pooling system.8 BNDES' lending rates
for direct operations or through financial intermediaries are either
indexed in BTN or in BNDES' basket of currencies, depending on the
sophistication of the final borrower. Generally, borrowers or sub-
5/ BNDES is not allowed by Central Bank regulations to take deposits from
the public.
6/ Buyers of commercial paper sought to hedge against an expected maxi-
devaluation of the local currency.
71 From 1990 onwards, BNDES loans are indexed to the IPC of IBGE.
8/ BNDES' basket of currencies is adjusted daily and includes U.S.
dollars, Japanese yen, German mark, Swiss franc, and World Bank
currency pool.



- 15 -
borrowers9 to whom BNDES lends are willing to accept risk only in a form in
which they are reasonably familiar and against which they believe they can
hedge. Normally, the larger and financially more sophisticated borrowers
have more opportunity to hedge against BNDES' basket of foreign currencies.
Therefore, not all borrowers who receive on-lent Bank funds will have to
repay the loan indexed by foreign exchange. Less sophisticated borrowers
will receive BNDES loans indexed by BTN. To en4ure that BNDES' foreign
exchange position is fully hedged, BNDES will use its domestic resources to
provide loans to other more sophisticated borrowers; however, these loans
will be indexed by BNDES' basket of foreign currencies so as to cover its
foreign exchange exposure.10   BNDES generally charges a 22 spread in
addition to passing on the entire cost of foreign borrowing. It is
therefore of utmost importance for BNDES financial health to continue with
its policy to fully hedge its foreign exchange risk.
2.25     In the past, most of BNDES loans, either from domestic or foreign
funding, were onlent to BNDES' customers indexed in OTN. Since 1986, the
OTN index applied in BNDES loans has been adjusted to fully reflect the
inflation rate, as measured by the IPC index of IBGE. From time to time
until 1984, OTN adjustments tell behind inflation which made BNDES' real
onlending rates negative. Whenever monetary correction fell behind
inflation, the reflows from BNDES' loans were smaller, in real terms, than
the original amount of its loans. Thus, the real value of BNDES' equity as
well as PISIPASEP trust funds was eroded, and less was available for BNDES
subsequent operations. To deal with this problem, in March 1990, BNDES
indexed its lending directly to the IPC to protect the real value of its
lending operations.
2.26     In general, the spreads to financial intermediaries on '.oans for
which the resources are mobilized domestically range from 1.52 to 2.5Z. No
limits are imposed on spreads to financial intermediaries on loans that are
indexed in BNDES' basket of foreign currencies.
k.27     Repayment schedules vary in accordance with the cash flow of the
projects being financed and are negotiated between BNDES and its borrowers.
For direct operations, generally large investment with long implementation
periods, the maximum grace period ranges between six months and two years,
repayment ranges from two to 12 years with an average of eight years, and
the payback schedule is monthly. When onlending funds mobilized externally
the paybpck schedule varies in accordance with the terms of the foreign
loan. For these operations, BNDES contributes up to 502 of the total
investment cost. For indirect operations through financial intermediaries,
generally small- and medium-size investments, the maximum grace period
ranges between six to 12 months, the repayment term ranges from two to six
years with an average of five years, and the payback schedule is generally
monthly. For these operations, BNDES contributes up to 552 of the total
ir.-estment cost.

2.28     In an economic environment In which there is no long-term credit
market, speculating over an appropriate long-term lending interest rate for
BNDES loans is a risky business. Certainly, it is inappropriate to use
short-term rates as a proxy for estimating a long-term rate. The real
interest rate on savings deposits -- which yields 6.38 per year -- is
useful for purposes of comparison in that it has been able to attract very
large amounts of private deposits. The Bank's Financial Sector work
(Report No. 7725-BR) explained the relevance of this real rate as a
benchmark for corresponding long-term lending rates. It may not be an
ideal comparator, but at the same time, the real interest rate BNDES
charges is on average nearly twice the savings deposit rate and, for
borroweru of foreign exchange, the interest rate includes the cost of the
entire foreign exchange risk plus a spread for BNDES.
E.  BNDES Profitability and Portfolio Quality
(i)   BNDES' Financial Performance and Profitability
2.29     BNDES is a financially healthy institution.  BNDES' audited
balance sheets and income statements for 1984 through 1989 are shown in
Annexes 9 and 10. BNDES' total assets at the end of December 1989 amount
to about US$29 billion equivalent. The size of these assets is 1.3 times
larger than Inter-American Development Bank's and one quarter of those of
the World Bank. Of BNDES' assets, about US$5 billion represents BNDES'
investments in its subsidiaries, BNDESPAR and FINAME, approximately US$22
billion represents loans outstanding to private and public compankes, and
the remaining balance of US$2 billion corresponds to assets of more
immediate liquidity. About 50? of BNDES outstanding loans are with the
private sector. The analysis of BNDES liabilities, capital, and reserves
highlights the fact that BNDES has a low leverage ratio of 22Z (equity to
total assets) and a very conservative 3.6 to 1 Debt/Equity ratio which
indicates capital strength and the ability to generate earnings and
facilitate expansion.
2.30     Audited profit and loss statements of BNDES for the twelve months
ending December 1989, show that BNDES generated a record operating profit
of about U5$2.5 billion equivalent. Most of this profit (about $1.5
billion) is attributable to (i) the sale of investments held by BNDES and
to the privatization of several BNDESPAR investments and (ii) the financial
measures taken by BNDES management such as (a) fully hedging BNDES' foreign
exchange exposure (para. 2.24); and (b) steadily increasing its average
lending rate to 10.52 in 1989 from about 72 in 1985 (para. 2.23).
The 1989 results are extremely good, performance, especially when compared
to previous years, particularly 1987 when BNDES incurred an operating loss
of about US$530 million mainly due to foreign exchange losses of about
US$700 million. BNDES' net into-est margin (Interest Income less Interest
Expenses over Average Loan Portfolio) for the year ending December 1989
yielded a 14? return, an excellent level for a low leveraged efficient
bank. In 1987 this margin was a negative 3?.
(ii)   Accounting and Audit
2.31     BNDES accounting system is sound and its financial statements are
well prepared. BNDES has a competent internal audit department, which
reports directly to BNDES' president. In addition to its normal auditing



- 17 -
functions, BNDES internal auditing department prepares a highly detailed
and useful annual review of BNDES operations and performance. BNDES also
has its annual accounts audited by competent, independent external
auditors, and publishes an annual report of its activities. BNDES has
received an unqual'fied opinion on its accounts for many years.
(iii)   BNDES' Loan Portfolio
2.32     About 502 of BNDES' US$22 billion equivalent of total outstanding
loans in December 1989 represented loans to the public sector.  The largest
borrower of BNDES is the SIDERBRAS groupl1 which owes BNDES about US$2.1
billion and represents 10? of total outstanding loans or 312 of BNDES
equity. With no other client, private or public, is BNDES' exposure so
significant. The second and third largest clients of BNDES are Aracruz
Celulose (private) and the Regional Bank of the South (public).
Outstanding loans to each of these represent less than 1.5? of BNDES
portfolio or 4.52 of BNDES equity.
2.33     All loans to federal or state enterprises and banks are guaranteed
by the Federal and State Governments respectively. State and Regional
Banks relend BNDES funds mainly to the private sector. Loans to the public
sector are spread over more than one hundred federal and state-owned
enterprises. Loans to the private sector represent 502 of BNDES system
loan portfolio, and are spread over about 300 clients and about forty
private financial intermediaries that have channelled BNDES funds to more
than 10,000 private clients.
2.34     BNDES recently undertook, with the help of its external auditors,
a thorough portfolio analysis. As of March 31, 1990, 52 or US$1.1 billion
of BNDES' lending portfolio was in arrears by 60 days or more; 912 of which
was with the public sector. The SIDERBRAS Group was responsible for about
502 of BNDES' arrears. The fo'lowing table provides a summary of the
composition of BNDES' non-performing loan portfolios
11/ The group consists of half a dozen enterprises, the largest axe COSIPA,
CSN, and USIMNAS.

BNDES' total loan portfolio is US$22 billion and its equity is US$6.4
billion.  BNDES' provision for bad debts i8s about 12 of its outstanding
portfolio and is considered adequate by BNDES external auditors, since (i)
most outstanding private sector loans are considered of good quality; (ii)
BNDES' public sector loans are guaranteed by the Federal or State
Governments; and (iii) BNDES holds real guarantees of at least 1301 of all
loans it makes either to the public or private sector.
2.35     BNDES is determined to improve the quality of its portfolio stock
and as such, it has undertaken to channel an increasing flow of its
resources to sound private sector companies, thereby reducing its exposure
to the public sector. Moreover, most (62Z) of BNDES' non-performing loan
portfolio is with public sector companies that have been targeted by the
federal government as candidates for the privatization program. Since
BNDES' president is chairing the nation's privatization commission and
BNDES will be executing the privatization program, BNDES plans to settle
its outstanding loans and arrears as part of the privatization agreements
to be reached with prospective buyers of these public companies.
F. Directed Credit
2.36     Since June 1989, BNDES has taken great strides in reducing the
ways in which it directs credit. The reforms have taken place under two
major categories: reducing the segmentation of credit and increasing the
discretion financial institutions have in intermediating BNDES' funds. To
reduce the segmentation of credit, BNDES 1) has undergone a far-reaching
reorganization which is designed a) to allow staff to devote more time to
expanding BNDES' group of potential clients; and b) to enable BNDES staff
to limit project analysis to technical, economic and financial viability
rather than encompassing criteria related to enterprise size, region of
operation, and whether the loan was to be made directly or through
intermediaries; and 2) has eliminated credit lines to financially
distressed firms. To facilitate financial intermediaries' dealings with



- 19 -
BNDES, BNDES has set up an automatic approval procedure for projects where
BNDES' participation is limited to US$1 million. These significant reforms
not only improve BNDES' operations and its responsiveness to borrowers and
intermediaries, but they also help to minimize economic distortions.
(i) Credit Seamentation
(a) Results of Reorganization
2.37     Prior to the reorganization, BNDES' structure encouraged credit
segmentation by giving special consideration to a firm's region of
operation, sector, size and whether the loan was to be made directly or
through intermediaries. Thus, such criteria interfered with project
analysis. This tended to segment and skew the allocation of credit. In
addition, it tended to slow down the project approval process. The new
system organizationally combines the analysis of operations undertaken
through intermediaries with those done directly by BNDES. All projects are
analyzed in accordance with the degree to which they expose BNDES to risk.
2.38     An important result of the reorganization is that it divided the
workload according to the depth of analysis necessitated by the corplexity
and riskiness of projects. For the analysis of smaller, low-risk projects,
often with established clients, there is now a Department of Operations.
Since less risky projects require less profound analysis, staff assigned to
such work are able to process loans more quickly. Larger and riskier
operations are analyzed in great depth by the Department of Entrepreneurial
Projects. Annex 3, TaAle 1 shows an updated organizational chart of BNDES.
2.39     This reorganization is significant because it frees up staff time
to attract new clients and develop their investment plans. Increasing the
number of clients with whom BNDES works will reduce the concentration of
lending operations BNDES undertakes with just the established firms. This
will tend to promote competitiveness by providing finance to new clients
and new entries in the market. In addition, it will also make the
analytical phase of project processing more efficient. The analysts who
are assigned to work with established clients will be very familiar with
the particular firms and their investment plans and thus will be better
able to speedily evaluate their prospects for continued BNDES financing.
2.40     BNDES' segmentation of eredit by company size merits further
examination. Since the size of BNDES' indirect borrowers tends to be
smaller than the size of its direct clients, the old system tended to
segment credit by size as well. Under the new system, BNDES is still more
likely to work directly with large companies as opposed to small. However,
this is entirely justified. It would be inefficient for BPDES to analyze
smaller projects of smaller firms itself rather than through financial
intermediaries because of BNDES' operating costs and lean project staff.
Moreover, given BNDES' low degree of financial leverage as compared to the
high degree of leverage of private banks, BNDES is one of very few
financial institutions in Brazil able to prudently finance the investment



- 20 -
needs of large firms.12   There are some few large, well-managed banks in
Brazil who are able to retain large companies as clients and who frequently
look to BNDES to help finance these firm's long-term funding requirements.
2.41     On the whole, these changes reduce the ways by which BNDES
segmented credit. It is likely to result in a better allocation of credit
to viable projects. It also simplifies and improves the efficiency of the
approval of operations. This Is likely to make BNDES a more appealing
financing source to both financial intermediaries and direct borrowers than
it was before.
(b) Elimination of Directed Lines of Credit
2.42     Another way that BNDES used to segment credit was by directing
financial assistance to financially distressed firms. This assistance was
provided both to BNDES' direct clients and through its intermediaries.
BNDES' operations of financial distress accounted for 23.6Z of
disbursements in 1988: about 80X of them by BNDES itself and 20X by
BNDESPAR. The elimination of operations of financial distress is
significant because such loans tended to prolong the survival of non-viable
firms, deterred their exit, and eliminated incentives for restructuring and
rationalization.
(ii) Facilitating BNDES' Operations through Financial Intermediaries
2.43     BNDES. by reducing its intervention in the credit decisions of the
financial institutions which intermediate its funds, has eliminated another
way by which it formerly directed credit. BNDES' previous method of
operation with financial intermediaries tended to over-involve it in the
allocation of credit and to slow down the project approval process. Every
project presented by intermediaries, regardless of the size of BNDES'
participation, was subject to a full and time-consuming review by BNDES'
project staff.
2.44     Since June 1989, in order to provide rapid and efficient service
to its network of financial intermediaries, BNDES instituted an automatic
discounting facility for project finance where BNDES- varticipation is
limited to US$1 million. Under this program (called POC Automatico),
financial intermediaries are required to submit to BNDES a summary sheet
(oficha resumo de operagao') describing the proposed operation and its
financing plan. They must assure BNDES that (a) the loan will be for
investments by private industrial firms; and (b) the financial intermediary
has analyzed the project and will supervise the loan according to both the
intermediary's own criteria and BNDES' procedures. BNDES must inform
financial intermediaries of its decision within five days of receiving the
'ficha resumo.'
2.45     The POC Automatico program is significant because it 1) signals to
financial intermediaries that they have more discretion in allocating the
funds which BNDES makes available to them through its second-tier financing
activities; and 2) it simplifies and improves the speed and efficiency of
121 It would take the combined equity of the ten largest private commercial
banks in Brazil to equal the equity of BNDES.



- 21 -
processing loan applications. The combination of these two factors make it
easier for financial intermediaries to do business with BNDES.
2.46     In the future, BNDES is likely to continue the trend of reducing
its involvement in the lending decisions of its intermediaries. In fact,
given its lean in-house staff, BNDES' future growth will come from its
indirect operations, particularly co-financing operations. BNDES foresees,
once the macroeconomic situation improves and private banks increase their
role in intermediating long-term funds, that it would operate in consortia
with private banks in undertaking large operations. This would place BNDES
in the position of catalyzing long-term finance for its customers, and
would spread the risk of these operations across several lenders.
G.  Increased Emphasis on Lending Effectiveness
(i) Evaluation of International Competitiveness
2.47     BNDES's Planning Department is embarking on an innovative program
to assess the international competitiveness of firms applying for financing
from the BNDES system. This program would be developed in-house, with the
support of outside consultants, and would strengthen BNDES' existing
project analysis methodology. The program also would make a significant
contribution to the Planning Department's formulation of lending policies.
2.48     In order to implement BNDES' new strategic objective (the
integration of Brazil into world markets), its Planning Department aims to
supplement the traditional methodology of proJect analysis with a strategic
analysis of international competitiveness. 3 To develop such analysis, the
Planning Department is systematically defining criteria for the evaluation
of new projects. Once the criteria are defined, the Planning Department
will formulate operational programs and financial conditions to improve
resource allocation.
2.49     The program would develop both quantitative and qualitative
indicators of international competitiveness, initially for a group of key
industr!al sectors. They would be kept and updated in a data base that
would allow for comparisons between Brazilian industry and international
standards for that industry. In addition to these quantitative and
qualitative indicators, the Planning Department will research the driving
factors of industrial competitiveness. It will examine the strategies of
firms which are world leaders in their industry and use the information
gained to develop criteria against which to analyze the competitiveness of
BNDES' clients. Finally, the program will study the industrial and
technological policies of countries which are internationally competitive
in the selected sectors.
13/ BNDES' project analysis methodology involves a thorough assessment of
the applicant firm's management and marketing capabilities as well as
the project's financial, technical, and economic viability. BNDES'
economic analysis methodology relies on.standard conversion factors
that require frequent updating to keep pace with Brazil's volatile
economy.



- 22 -
2.50     BNDES has requested technical assistance from the Bank to finance
consultants and training to support the development of this program. An
outline of this program is given in Annex 6.
(ii) Operational Performance AuditinK
2.51     After the recent reorganization, BNDES' Internal Audit Department
gained increased autonomy and responsibilities. Now reporting directly to
the president of the Council of BNDES, the Audit Department is expanding
the focus of its work from predominantly financial accounting to
operational performance auditing as well.
2.52     As BNDES is becoming more profit-minded, its Audit Department is
evaluating the effectiveness of operating procedures and internal controls.
Unlike accounting audit which is concerned with verifying accounts and
controls and concentrates primarily on the past, performance auditing is
concerned w'th the efficiency of operations with a view toward increasing
profits for the future. This new focus will expand the role of the
internal audit department into analyzing various activities of BNDES to (i)
determine whether they comply with management's policies; (ii) ensure they
meet management's objectives; and (iii) recommend changes in policies that
would lead to rore efficient operations. Of particular emphasis will be
BNDES' lending policies, supervision of loans, credit policies and
procedures, capital market activites, resource mobilization, and
procurement.
2.53     Since the audit department has little prior experience in this
work, it is requesting technical assistance from the Bank to support
training. Training would involve specialized coursework as well as
internLhips in similar institutions that successfully practice operational
audit. An outline of this program is provided in Annex 6.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Objectives
3.01     The objectives of the project are:
(a) to support BNDES' reorientation to the private sector and to
reduce its exposure to the public sector by:
(i) increasing in relative terms the flow of BNDES resources to
the private sector by reducing its credit to the public
sector; and
(ii)  increasing in relative terms the flow of BNDES' resources
through private financial intermediaries and decreasing
resources to state and federally-owned financial
intermediaries.
(b) to support BNDES' reorganization which is designed to reduce
credit segmentation by distributing credit to sound projects,
rather than according to sectoral, regional and company size
criteria;



- 23 -
(c) to support and reinforce BNDES' effort to strengthen its newly
established credit policies and procedures;
(d) to support BNDES' Planning Department's program to develop
indicators of international competitivaness; and
(e) to support BNDES' Audit Department's program to develop the
capability and procedures for operational performance auditing.
B. Project Descriptior.
3.02     The loan will finance technically, financially and economically
justified private investments without regard to sector, region or company
size. This loan will not be a directed line of credit. The investment
projects will be presented to BNDES either by private investors or by
private financial intermediaries representing investors. To promote the
participation of private financial intermediaries in allocating Bank funds,
BNDES will inform the intermediaries, not later than two months after loan
effectiveness, that these funds are available and about the conditions of
their use. When requesting Bank financing, BNDES will submit a subproject14
appraisal report that the Bank will evaluate prior to approving the
commitment of funds. When submitting subprojects to the Bank, BNDES will
include its assessment of whether the firm or financial intermediary meets
BNDES' creditworthiness criteria. The Bank will not commit more than US$15
mi 'on equivalent per subproject. BNDES will pass on to its borrowers the
full cost of IBRD funds including the foreign exchange risk plus a spread.
The loan will have a technical assistance component not to exceed US$0.5
million equivalent for (1) the Credit Department to impro7e its policies
and procedures; (2) the Planning Department to support its program to
develop indicators of international competitiveness; and (3) the Audit
Department to develop the capability and procedures for operational
performance auditing.
3.03     BNDES could commit up to US$150 million of the loan for
subprojects in the first 12 months after loan effectiveness. At that time,
the Bank will review BNDES' performance over the past 12 months, and next
12 months' plans in accordance with agreed criteria. If found
satisfactory, the balance of the loan would be available for commitment.
Loan funds that were not fully committed by the end of the next 12 months
will become available for commitment after the Bank's review of BNDES'
performance and the next year's plans. The criteria to be used to review
BNDES' performance and plans are: (a) the BNDES system will reduce its
flow of credit to public sector borrowers from 362 and 272 in 1988 and 1989
to 23Z and 19Z in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1992, BNDES will limit
the flow of credit to the public sector to no more than the 1991 levels;
(b) the BNDES system will steadily reduce the participation of public
financial intermediaries in allocating the resources BNDES disburses
through financial intermediaries from 582 and 50Z in 1988 and 1989 to 452
and 402 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1992, BNDES will limit the
public financial intermediaries' participation to no more than the 1991
levels; and (c) the spread between BNDES' yearly average cruzeiro lending
14/ "Subproject" refers to investment projects of BNDES' borrowers.



- 24 -
rates and its average cruzeiro borrowing rates 1s should provide a margin
sufficient to cover all its costs, prudent risk provisioning, and normal
profits. The Bank obtained a letter from BNDES' president containing
criteria to measure BNDES' plans and performance. The letter sets forth
the project's objectives, BNDES' strategic plan for 1989-92, detailed
performance targets for that period, and BNDES' plans to settle its non-
performing loan portfolio. During loan negotiations, the Bank and BNDES
agreed on the procedures for the twelve-month reviews and the criteria that
will be used to review BNDES' performance and plans.
C. Credit Policy and Loan Portfolio
(i) Credit Policy
3.04     BNDES is formulating credit guidelines which are based on the
objectives discussed in paras. 2.08 through 2.10 for the companies with
whom it deals directly and for the financial intermediaries of BNDES'
loans. During negotiations, the Bank and BNDES agreed that BNDES will
implement credit policies and adhere to procedures to evaluate the
creditworthiness of its clients. Among these policies and procedures,
BNDES will: (a) develop, not later than December 31, 1990, a detailed
training program in accordance with the topics in paragraph 3.06; (b)
establish, not later than December 31, 1990, and maintain thereafter
overall credit and risk limits for financial intermediaries; (c) establish,
not later than 12 months after Loan Effectiveness, and maintain thereafter,
policies and procedures to determine creditworthiness and parameters for
setting individual credit limits for all companies that deal directly with
BNDES; and (d) not later than December 31, 1991, establish risk management
programs and furnish a report to the Bank assessing the effectiveness of
its policy for obtaining security for its loars.
(ii) Loan Portfolio
3.05     BNDES is addressing the problems of its non-performing assets
through both Brazil's privatization program and direct negotiations with
borrowers in arrears. BNDES' Credit Department has recently established a
division for credit recuperation. Since 382 of BNDES' non-performing
assets are with borrowers that are not slated for privatization. this
division is actively negotiating the recovery of these credits. Most of
these borrowers are state governments, state enterprises, and the federal
railways. BNDES is confident that these borrowers will fully pay off their
debts in the near future. During loan negotiations, the Bank and BNDES
agreed that by December 31, 1991, the Bank will review BNDES' lending
portfolio to verify the progress made by BNDES in reducing the arrears
existing on March 31, 1990 and BNDES will furnish to the Bank a plIn of
action to settle any such remaining arrears.
15/ There is little difference between BNDES' average and marginal cost of
borrowings. Since BNDES sells its commercial paper and CDs to a
captive market, the marginal cost of funds which BNDES mobilizes in the
domestic market is roughly the same as the average cost of BNDES' stock
of funds.



- 25 .
D. Technical Assistance
Ci) Credit Denartment
3.06     BNDES is developing a detailed training program to improve the
policies and procedures of its Credit Department. Through technical
assistance, this loan would support this training program. An outline of
the program is presented in Annex 6. The program would have two
objectivest (a) to familiarize BNDES' Credit Area management, and other
staff closely related to the Credit Department, with the theory and
practice of credit evaluation as it is carried out in the world's principal
banking centers; and (b) to implement in the Credit Area and disseminate
throughout the BNDES System, the theory and practice of credit evaluation
which has been identified as appropriate to Brazil and BNDES. The training
program would focus on the following areas: credit analysis methodology and
the evaluation of risk; creating credit norms, procedures and manuals;
treatment of different guarantees; special transactions such as related
zompanies; special operations; minimizing exposure by firm, sector and
product; hedging against risk; recognizing deteriorating loans and
evaluating the quality of loans already granted; computerized support
systems; and management training in credit policies and procedures.
3.07     A major part of the training component will be used to cover the
cost of courses and seminars as well as "on-the-job" training programs in
Brazil or overseas for BNDES staff. The training program includest
'i) Visits of BNDES staff to major banking institutions;
(ii) On-the-job training of BNDES staff in banking/credit
institutions;
(iii) Attendance of seminars; and
(iv) Hiring of consultants to perform in-house seminars.
(ii) Planning Department
3.08     BNDES is developing new tools to supplement its project analysis
methodology. These tools will help assess the international
competitiveness of its clients. The project will involves a) the
selection of quantitative and qualitative indicators of competitiveness; b)
the study of corporate strategy of firms which are world leaders in their
sector; and c) the study of the industrial and technological policies of
countries with industries which are competitive in selected sectors. A
full description of the program is given in psras. 2.47-2.49.
3.09     BNDES has requested technical assistance from the Bank to finance
consultants and training to support the development of this program. An
outline of the consultant work and training required is given in Annex 6.
(iii) Audit Department
3.10     As BNDES' Internal Audit Department expands its role into
operational auditing, it will require specialized training. The training
will support the Audit Department's efforts to measure the effectiveness of
BNDES' organizational structure, its policies and practices, and its
systems and procedures. The goal will be to enable BNDES to find improved
methods of reducing costs and increasing profits.



- 26 -
3.11     The training program would involve seminars and internships.  The
initial phase of the program would enable BNDES to undertake a preliminary
survey which would consist of limited testing in all functional areas to
isolate critical problem areas. In later phases, the Audit Department
would substantiate the preliminary survey findings. For more information
on operational auditing, see paras. 2.51-2.52. A detailed outline of the
training program, is given in Annex 6.
E. Borrower and Onlendina Terms
3.12     The Borrower will be the National Bank for Economic and Social
Development (BNDES) and the Guarantor will be the Federative Republic of
Brazil. Principal and interest payments on the Bank loan will be made by
BNDES and BNDES will take the foreign exchange risk. Bank funds will be
on-lent according to BNDES' standard lending policies. BNDES will pass on
to its borrowers the full cost of IBRD funds, including the foreign
exchange risk, plus at least a 22 spread. BNDES onlending terms and
conditions to financial intermediaries or for direct lending operations are
discussed in detail in paras. 2.23-2.27. BNDES onlending terms and
conditions are modified from time to time to reflect prevailing conditions
in Brazilian and international capital markets. During negotiations it was
agreed that, in addition to the interest rate agreements (para. 3.03), the
Bank will consider it a failure of the index or indexes applied in BNDES'
cruzeiro loans to achieve full adjustments on the principal of BNDES loans
if, for each of three consecutive months, the adjustment to the index
applied is below the variation of inflation as measured by the IPC index of
IBGE (para. 2.25). Moreover, the Bank and BNDES also agreed that BNDES
will continue to fully hedge its foreign exchange exposure (para. 2.24).
F. Amount of Loan. Proiect Cost, Financing Plan and Demand for Funds
3.13     The Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent will have two
components. The first, US$299.5 million, will finance private investment
and the second, for US$0.5 million, will finance technical assistance. The
loan will support an investment program totalling an estimated US$1.198
billion of which Bank Lnd BNDES resources would cover about 50g. The Bank
loan will cover 502 of BNDES disbursements for fixed assets and permanent
working capital subprojects. This represents 25? of the cost of eligible
subprojects and the estimated foreign exchange component of the
subprojects. The provision of counterpart funds will be automatic, since
the Bank will reimburse BNDES for its share of loans it already made. The
following chart summarizes the eatimated costs and financing plant

3.14     As credit for the private sector has become more scarce in Brazil
under current fiscal policies, BNDES faces a large list of good projects
(i.e., projects realizing a minimum economic rate of return of 122), from
which it would select its investments. The bank had no difficulty
disbursing its previous loans to BNDES to projects that met the guidelines
for project selection according to economic rates of return. The same
guidelines will apply to this operation as well. High inflation rates have
not diminished BNDES ability to disburse. For ezample, BNDES yearly
disbursements in 1987 and 1988 were about US$5 billion equivalent, while
inflation rates were 2001 and 7002 respectively, largely due to indexation
of BNDES' loans with inflation.
G. SubDroiect Anproval Procedures
3.15     BNDES has established subproject appraisal procedures and formats
for appraisal reports. BNDES' methodology of Project Analysis will govern
subproject appraisal practices. This loan, as in the two previous loans
(2225-BR and 2488-BR), will establish a free limit below which the Bank
will not require a full subproject appraisal report but only a summary
sheet - Ficha Resumo de Operagao - to approve subproject commitments for a
proposed investment. For any subproject in which Bank financing exceeds
US$5 million equivalent, the Bank will require a full appraisal report to
approve subproject commitments. During negotiations, the Bank and BNDES
agreed on the levels and limits of Bank subproject financing and subproject
approval procedures.
3.16     The summary sheet (Annex 11) covers all essential data about the
enterprise, its financial condition, the project and project costs and
financing plan and BNDES' loan amount. The information requirements for
subprojects submitted for Bank financing above the free limit are given in
Annex 12, and follow BNDES' own requirements as spelled out in BNDES'
methodology for analyzing projects. This methodology includes the analysis
of (a) the firm or group presenting the project and its management; (b) the
level of market competition; (c) the technical aspects including equipment
and civil works procurement procedures; (d) the financial condition of the
firm, the sources and uses of funds, sensitivity analysis and financial
internal rates of return; Ce) economic and social aspects, economic rates
of return and employment effect; (f) environmental aspects including an



- 28 -
environmental impact assessment of the project; and (g) guarantees obtained
by BNDES or by the financial intermediary.
3.17     Subproject approval will also depend on the creditworthiness of
the firm or financial intermediary presenting the investment project. The
Bank would refuse to commit funds to a subproject presented by a firm or
intermediary that would otherwise not qualify for BNDES' credit, should
BNDES make an exception to its own credit policies. It was agreed during
negotiations that when submitting subprojects to the Bank, BNDES will
include its assessment of whether the intermediary bank or firm meets BNDES
creditworthiness criteria.
H. Audit
3.18     As in Loans 2225-BR and 2248-BR, it will be a condition of the
loan that BNDES continue to engage independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. These independent auditors would perform audits on BNDES' yearly
financial statements and on the project's Statement of Expenditures in
accordance with Bank Audit and Financial Information Requirements and
submit their report to the Bank within six months after the closing date of
the audited period. In addition, BNDES would also engage independent
auditors that would perform separate audits on the Special Accounts and
submit their report to the Bank within six months after the closing date of
the audited period (para. 2.31).
I. Procurement
3.19     In checking procurement, BNDES verifies that goods and services
procured under projects it directly finances are competitive in price and
quality, and are appropriate for the purpose intended. When operating
through financial intermediaries, BNDES relies on the procurement
procedures of the intermediary (Annex 3). The financial intermediaries
rely mainly upon the normal commercial practice of their customers to shop
around for the best quality goods and services at the lowest price.
3.20     The Bank loan (US$299.5 million) would finance the foreign
currency requirements of subprojects and 1002 of the c.i.f. costs of direct
imports. Bank resources would finance civil works, inventories and
machinery and equipment. Machinery and equipment financed by BNDES (which
would be mainly imported) would be eligible for financing under the loan.
For procurement of machinery, equipment and inventories costing US$3
million or less, normal commercial practices would be followed.
International shopping procedures (including at least three bids, of which
at least two bids will be from foreign suppliers) would be required for
contract values higher than US$3 million but lower than US$5 million, and
international competitive bidding (ICB) would be required for contract
values of US$5 million and above, in accordance with 'Bank Guidelines for
Procurement" (May 1985). For civil works, normal commercial practices
would be followed for contracts below US$10 million and ICB would be
required for contract values of US$10 million and above. Evidence of
compliance with Bank procurement procedures would be a necessary part of
the subproject appraisal reports submitted by BNDES to the Bank.



- 29 -
3.21     The above procurement thresholds are justified.  In the case of
civil works, the Brazilian construction industry is highly developed and as
a result, few, if any, foreign contractors would bid except on very large
civil works contracts and many would be dissuaded even in these cases from
bidding because of the low capacity utilization of the Brazilian
construction industry. Brazilian private companies generally obtain
inventories, machinery and equipment from established domestic or foreign
sources of supply or engage in domestic or international shopping as a
matter of established business practice. BNDES considers, and we agree,
that the procurement practices of its private sector clients are adequate
to assure that the goods and services it finances are obtained in an
efficient manner. BNDES reviews the procurement of goods it finances ex
post to assure that they are competitive in price and quality and are
appropriate for the purpose intended. Moreover, BNDES operates through
more than forty private financial intermediaries that discount with BNDES
their investment loans whenever they are within BNDES' free limit. To
require ICB procedures for goods contracts below US$5 million and civil
works contracts below US$10 million would slow down loan disbursements to a
point that would discourage most financial intermediaries to use Bank loan
funds. In addition, it would impose on BNDES an excessive supervision
burden because of the large number of contracts for which ICB procedures
would be required.
3.22     The remainder of the loan (US$0.5 million) would be disbursed for
technical assistance, to pay BNDES' expenses of training and consultant
services. Consultants to be financed by the loan will be employed in
accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in the "Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency' published by the Bank in August 1981.
J. Disbursements
3.23     Bank disbursements would be limited to (a) 1002 of foreign
expenditures for imported machinery, equipment and materials financed by
BNDES; (b) 1002 of foreign and local expenditures for services of foreign
consultants and training financed by BNDES; and (c) 502 of local
expenditures for civil works, materials, machinery and equipment financed
by BNDES. Total disbursements from the loan account for any given
subproject would not exceed US$15 million equivalent. The Bank would
reimburse BNDES for the expenditures it made up to 180 days prior to the
Bank's receiving BNDES request for subproject authorization. The Bank
would retroactively finance, from January 1, 1990, up to 102 of the loan.
Retroactive financing would be justified to continue BNDES' program of
meeting its clients' strong demand for foreign exchange. Since funds from
Loan 2488-BR are about to become exhausted and since the Bank is one of
BNDES' few sources of foreign exchange, retroactive financing is essential
to avoid interrupting BNDES' program. Moreover, the loan is based in part
on BNDES' 1989 and 1990 targets and its progress in meeting them. As such,
BNDES should have the benefit of the loan proceeds for subproject
disbursements it made throughout 1990, a period in which BNDES would be
fulfilling policy commitments it made to the Bank (para. 3.04). To
expedite project execution and reduce the interval during which BNDES would
finance the Bank's share of project costs, a Special Account in US dollars
would be established in the Central Bank of Brazil to cover local currency



- 30 -
expend-.tures. The amount initially deposited in the Special Account would
not exceed US$35 million. BNDES would be entitled to make periodic
withdrawal from the Special Account. Foreign exchange expenditures
incurred would also be made from a separate Special Account which would be
established in a private commercial bank abroad with an initial deposit not
exceeding US$5 million. The Bank would replenish both special accounts up
to the initial deposit for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible
expenditures at the request of the borrower. It was also agreed during
negotiations that direct withdrawals from the Loan Account will be in
amounts not less than US$500,000 equivalent.
3.24     As in Loan 2488-BR, and as part of this loan's audit covenant
(para. 3.18), BNDES agreed that its independent auditors will, as part of
their annual audit, give an opinion as to whether statements of
expenditures can be fairly relied upon to support applications for
reimbursement from the Loan Account. In this opinion, the auditors will
have to determine that: (i) the Statements of Expenditures and the
supporting schedules and information submitted with them present fairly, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the proceeds of
the loan obtained on the basis of SOE; (ii) such proceeds have been used to
make payments for goods received and works and services performed; and
(iii) such goods, works or services were eligible for financing under the
Loan Agreement and were used in carrying out the project. If the auditors
express a qualified opinion, they should describe their reason.
Withdrawals of expenditures against contracts valued at less than US$5
million would be made under Statements of Expenditures certified by BNDES.
During negotiations it was agreed that BNDES will have the Special Accounts
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit of
special accounts will cover statements of transactions and availability of
funds for the calendar year.
3.25     The Bank loan is expected to be committed in about 24 months from
loan effectiveness and disbursed in about three and one half years. The
closing date for the Bank loan would be December 31, 1993. Disbursements
under the Second Development Banking Project (Loan 2225-BR) were fully made
within three years from loan approval vis a vis an appraisal estimate of
four years. Disbursements under the Third Development Banking Project
(Loan 2488-BR) will have been fully made within four years as estimated in
the appraisal report (not counting an initial delay of one year due to
getting the economic analysis methodology urtderway). BNDES disbursement
profile is about one-to-one and six months shorter than the Bank's profile
for similar lending in Brazil. BNDES considers and we agree that the
estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 13) reasonably reflects the
disbursements profile for the proposed loan.
K. Project Benefits
3.26     The shift in BNDES' lending from the public to the private sector
is expected to result in an additional US$1.1 billion in finance for the
private sector from 1990 to 1992. By implementing a creditworthiness
policy and by increasing the flow of resources to the private sector, the
project will improve the allocation of BNDES' resources towards profitable
investments and allow economically desirabba industries to emerge or expand
nationwide. BNDES would be strengthened as a financial institution by its
increased private sector orientation and the quality of its assets would be
improved.



- 31 -
L.  Proiect Risks
3.27     Even though aggregate domestic demand may fall as a result of the
Government's new economic policies, it is likely that demand for investment
credit will be strong for two reasons: (1) firms will reorient production
for export mareets and (2) firms will face competition from imports as a
result of trade liberalization. To meet these challenges, Brazilian
industry will need to modernize its industrial plant. Since this loan will
finance imported machinery and equipment, there will be strong demand for
the proceeds of this loan.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
4.01     During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with BNDES on the
following matters:
(i) BNMES will implement credit policies and adhere to procedures
to evaluate the creditworthiness of its clients (para. 3.04).
Among these policies and procedures, BNDES will:
(a)  develop, by December 31, 1990, a detailed credit analysis
training program;
(b)  establish, not later than December 31, 1990, and maintain
thereafter, overall credit and risk limits for financial
intermediaries;
(c)  establish, not later than 12 months after loan
effectiveness, and maintain thereafter, parameters for
setting individual credit limits for all companies that
deal directly with BNDES; and
5d)  establish risk management programs and furnish a report to
the Bank assessing the effectiveness of its policy of
obtaining security for its loans, not later than December
31, 1991.
(ii) BNDES and the Bank will review BNDES' lending portfolio, by
December 31, 1991, to verify the progress made in reducing the
arrears existing on March 31, 1990 and BNDES will furnish to
the Bank a plan of action to settle any such remaining arrears
(para. 3.05);
(iii)  BNDES will continue to fully hedge its foreign exchange
exposure (para. 3.12);
(iv) BNDES will continue to apply indexes which protect the real
value of its lending operations (para. 3.12);
(v) BNDES will continue to engage independent auditors to perform
audits on BNDES' yearly financial statements, and provide
separate audits on statement of expenditures and the special
accounts (para. 3.18);
(vi) BNDES will inform private financial intermediaries that the
Bank loan funds are available and about the conditions of their
use (para. 3.02);



- 32 -
(vii) BNDES agreed on the procedures for the twelve-month reviews and
the criteria to be used to review BNDES' performance and plans.
Authorization of subproject commitments would be limited to
US$150 million equivalent in the first twelve months after loan
effectiveness. Further commitments of US$150 million
equivalent for subproject approvals will depend on the progress
made by BNDES in meeting the agreed criteria. The criteria
are: (a) the BNDES system will reduce its flow of credit to
public sector borrowers from 362 and 272 in 1988 and 1989 to
232 and 192 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1992, BNDES
will limit the flow of credit to the public sector to no more
than the 1991 levels; (b) the BNDES system will steadily reduce
the participation of public financial intermediaries in
allocating the resources BNDES disburses through financial
intermediaries, from 582 and 502 in 1988 and 1989 to 452 and
402 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1992, BNDES will limit
the public financial intermediaries participation to no more
than the 1991 levels: and (c) the spread between BNDES' yearly
average cruzeiro lending rates and its average cruzeiro
borrowing rates should provide a margin sufficient to cover all
its costs, prudent risk provisioning, and normal profits. In
1989 this spread was about four percentage points (para. 3.03);
(viii) BNDES agreed that Bank loan funds would be limited to US$15
million equivalent per subproject and that direct withdrawals
from the Loan Account will be in amounts not less than
US$500,000 (para. 3.23);
(ix) BNDES agreed on the subproject approval procedures (paras.
3.15-3.16); and
(x) BNDES will include its assessment of whether the firm or
financial intermediary meets BNDES creditworthiness criteria,
when submitting subprojects to the Bank (para. 3.17).
Recommendation
4.02     With the above agreements, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent to BNDES, under
terms and conditions applicable for Brazil, with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of Brazil.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCE PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF BNDES
OrEanization and StaffLnA
1.       The BNDES system Is presided over by the Council of BKDES, Board
of Directors, and Fiscal Council. BNDES' president heads the Council of
BNDES and Board of Directors. The Council of BNDES Is the highest
directing authority over BNDES. It examines and approves BNDES' general
long-term policies, heeding SEPLAN's guidance. The Council has six
mbers, all named by the president of the Republic, and meets four times
per year. BNDES' Board of Directors consisto of BNDES' president, vice
president, and four directors named by the president of the Republic.
These directors become part of BNDES' executive staff for three years and
meet at least once a week. The Board approves BNDES' activities and
administrative operating policies. It approv&s operations ovAr 1.2 million
BTN (about US$1.1 million equivalent), grants for certain types of
research, investments in shares and fixed assets, balance sheets, and
borrowing contracts. The Fiscal Council has three members and three
alternates named by the president of the Republic, and examines and gives
its opinion on BNDES' semi-annual financial statements.
2.       The operational, administrative and financial activities of the
BIDES system are overseen by the president. Day-to-day management of each
of the seven operating departments is the responsibility of a
superintendent. Under each superintendent there are department chiefs,
managers and technical advisors. The operating departments include
Planning, Finance and International, Administration, Credit, Operations,
Entrepreneurial Projects and Infrastructure Projects. In addition, BNDES
has an Internal Audit Department, Office of the President, and a Legal
Department. BNDES' organisational chart is shown in Table 1 of this annex.
The detailed functions of each of these ares is available In the Project
Files.
3.       All of BNDES' staff have passed a competitive selection process
and they are competent and dedicated professionals. As of December 1989,
the BNDES system employed 2,317 peoples 1,725 in BNDES, 429 in BNDESPAR,
and 163 in FINAME. 922 of BNDES' staff have more than 15 years of service.
Changes in staff levels and breakdown by level is shown in Table 2 of this
annex. BNDES has training programs for its staff which are identified by
the executive staff.

Plannina and Budgeting Procedures
4.       BNDES' Planning Area transforms SEPLAN's overall objectives into
action by carrying out a sophisticated budgeting process. This budgeting
process not only provides financial and staff resource planning and control
but also allows BNDES and its subsidiaries flexibility in responding to
changes in SEPLAN's policies. Every three years, the Budget Department
develops its multi-year administrative and investment budget, which is
updated every year and revised every six months. The budget classifies
projects by whether they are direct or indirect operations, their
objective, responsible operating area, level of coimmitment, whether the
project is public or private, and source of financing. This classification
enables BNDES to adjust its operations fairly rapidly based on the
availability of budget resources. Before its budget allocation is
finalized, it needs to be approved by Congress. BENDES' actual performance
on meeting budget targets is measured every month in a report called
'Performance Indicators." The Planning Area also develops economic
scenarios, action plans, study plans and the strategic plan.
BNDES' Operating Procedures
S.       While the Planning Area sets the overall objectives of the
organization, the Operating Areas put them into action.
(i) Direct Operations
6.       Projects of borrowers and intermediaries cleared by the Credit
Department are analyzed by the operations department, the entrepreneurial
projects department, or the infrastructure projects department. Prior to
the reorganization, BNDES had an operational area which dealt exclusively
with projects that were generally small and financed indirectly by
financial intermediaries. Now, all projects, regardless of their size and
whether they are undertaken directly or indirectly, are analyzed and
supervised by project analysts who have sectoral expertise. In addition to
analyzing and supervising projects, analysts also identify opportunities
for operations with new clients.
7.       Projects are carefully appraised and supervised by competent
analysts who follow BNDES' established procedures and formats. Once a
prospective borrower receives word that its loan application has cleared
the Credit Area, it submits to ENDES a detailed project report. Based on
the borrowers' report, BNDES staff prepares an appraisal report which is
submitted to BNDES' President or Board. The staff carefully analyzes many
aspects of the project, such as management, marketing, technical,
financial, economic, and environmental. Guidelines for carrying out the
analysis are published annually in BNDES' Methodology of Proiect Analysis.
The World Bank contributed to this document when, through Loan 2488-BR, it
helped BNDES to develop and apply economic analysis to its projects.
8.       The larger the BNDES financing requirement, the higher the
organizational level which is responsible for deciding on the operation.
If a project is approved, BNDES arranges for the contracting of the
financing and closely monitors the project during and after the
disbursement phase. Disbursements are made, normally in tranches, subject
to the Borrower's satisfactory performance in executing the project and in



- 41 -                    AMNE  3
Page 3 of 3
meeting the conditions of the loan. BNDES staff carries out regular
supervision visits during the project  implementation period as well as
during the operation and requires its Borrowers to submit periodic progress
reports. BNDES verifies that the goods and services procured under the
project are competitive in price and quality, and are appropriate for the
purpose intended. It also assures that the proceeds of financing are used
only for the goods and services authorized by BNDES at the time of loan
approval. BNDES has the option of cancelling operations and may ast up
conditions of loan effectiveness.
(ii) Operations through Financial Intermediaries
9.       BNDES' procedures for indirect operations were streamlined during
the reorganization. Its procedures vary depending on the amount of the
proposed loan.
10.     Agents who present paojects which require more than US$1 million
of BNDES financing must prep, :e and submit to BNDES a detailed appraisal
report of the operation and he beneficiary. Formats for subproject
appraisal reports are estab.ished by BNDES and cover all essential data
about the enterprise, the subproject, and the loan. These appraisal
reports use the same approach as BNDES takes for its direct operations, and
emphasize financial and economic criteria, as well as technical and
environmental soundness. Financial Intermediaries receive training from
BNDES in preparing project appraisals, and the Bank, from its experience
with these appraisals in Loan 2488-BR, has found them to be of high
quality.   BNDES' staff reviews and comments on these appraisals and
prepares a report on the subproject. If the Operational Department
endorses the subproject, it sends it either to the Department's director or
to BNDES' Board for approval, depending on the size of the financing
requirement.
1.      BNDES oversees the procurement, disbursemenc. and supervision of
its subprojects. BNDES normally relies on the procurement procedures of
the financial intermediaries. These are based on the normal commercial
practices of project beneficiaries who purchase from the most advantageous
source after canvassing alternative sources of supply. Subloan
disbursement requests from financial intermediaries must include a
statement of expenditures supporting such requests. The original documents
are retained by the agents. BNDES' operations staff as well as BNDES'
internal and external auditors review these documents on periodic
supervision missions.
12.      BNDES' external auditors provide a separate report and opinion on
BNDES' subproject disbursements, expenditures, and the quality of records.
In 1989 its opinion was unqualified. The Bank's own experience has found
the procurement and disbursement procedures of BNDES' operations with
intermediaries to be satisfactory.

Training to Develop Indicators of International Competitiveness
Description
For the preparatory stage of project development, BNDES would require
support of individual outside consultants as well as research missions for
the Planning Department to be able to accomplish the following:
a) to select the sample sectors;
b) to define the quantitative and qualitative indicators of
competitiveness;
c) to build the economic model and develop the data base of
competitiveness indicators; and
d) to develop the framework for analyzing corporate strategies and
industrial and technological policies.
It would also involve data collection missions: to develop the data
bank of competitiveness indicators and to acquire a national and
international bibliography and specialized journals.
Once the above work has been completed for the initial stages of the
project, the project would need to gain information on corporate strategy;
industrial and technological policies; and industrial competition. In
order to do so, the Planning Department would send eight executives on
missions to:
a) national or foreign corporations which are leaders in their
sectors;
b) public institutions which formulate industrial and technological
policies; and
c) centers of research and learning which develop models of
industrial competitiveness.
Execution
The technical assistance funds will finance:
a) twelve trips to the United States, Europe and Japan by BNDES'
officials;
b) three internal seminars to discuss quantitative and qualitative
indicators of international competitiveness;
c) the hiring of four consultants to develop models of industrial
competitiveness; and
d) development of a data base and library.

Technical Assistance Program for BNDES' Internal Audit Department
I.       Background
BNDES' Internal Audit Department is expanding its role from
financial accounting into operational-performance auditing. As BNDES is
becoming more profit-minded, it needs to find improved methods of reducing
costs and increasing profits. Performance auditing will assist BNDES in
evaluating its structure and policies to determine whether they are
enabling management to achieve its objectives.
Since the audit department has no experience in this area, it is
requesting technical assistance from the Bank to support its training
program.
II.      TraininR Needs
The training needs include generalized coursework provided by
professional associations and institutes in addition to specialized
practical professional training obtained through internships in other
development banks and agencies. Ideally, these institutions would be
highly proficient in operational-performance auditing and would offer
specialized courses.
III.     Specific Topics
(a) Administration of Internal Audit Departments.
(b) Planning and Programming in Internal Audit Departments.
(c)  New techniques, focuses, and trends in internal auditing.
(d) Current approaches to performance auditing as practiced by
financial institutions.
(e) Accountability and public resources management; evaluation as
management responsibility and contemporary approaches to the
evaluation process.
IV.      Execution
The technical assistance funds will finance:
(a) eight trips for BNDES' officials to professional training
courses;
(b) four trips for BNDES' officials to internships; and
(c) the hiring of two consultants to give internal seminars to
BNDES' staff.
