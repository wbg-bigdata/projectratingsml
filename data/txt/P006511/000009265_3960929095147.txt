MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO ECONOMICO E SOCIAL
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Banco Nacional de Desanvolvimento
Economico e Social (BNDES) of Brazil for US$300 million equivalent. The
proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed amortization
schedule, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would help finance productive private sector investments.
2.       BACKGROUND.  Brazil's financial sector is large and complex, with
assets of about US$240 billion. The issues affecting the sector include:
a recent history of very high and variable inflation rates; no market long-
term lending rates; limited access to external borrowing; a multitude of
reserve requirements on demand deposits; a regulation barring banks from
paying interest on demand deposits; poor information disclosure, prudential
regulations and supervisory practices; government-administered deposit
interest rates; deposit insurance system limited to savings and loans
institutions; and government direction and subsidization of much of total
credit. Entry into the banking system was also limited by 'licenses" which
could be bought only from a bank of similar size which was leaving the
market. The institution-specific issues include: thin and highly volatile
capital markets that are poorly regulated; a large and financially
distressed state banking system; a highly subsidized housing finance
system; and a large federal development bank--BNDES--whose past practices
encouraged an inefficient allocation of resources.
3.       These and other distortions prevented the Brazilian financial
system from efficiently performing the saving-investment intermediation
process. The issues noted above hindered monetary control, amplified
macroeconomic imbalances, segmented financial markets, adversely affected
resources allocated to the financial system, and may have contributed to
regressive income distribution.
4.       The objective of financial reform is to integrate financial
markets to ensure efficient intermediation of funds and low transaction
costs so that differences in interest rates mainly would reflect time
preferences and risks perceived by the market. Achieving this broad
objective involves (i) reducing credit segmentation and government
interference in credit markets; (ii) increasing banking competition and
financial intermediation efficiency; (iii) improving transparency and
information disclosure; (iv) strengthening prudential regulations and the
Central Bank's supervision practices; and (v) enhancing financial stability
and monetary control. The government has already embarked on an ambitious
financial sector reform program dealing with many of the problems which
have affected the sector (see para. 11).
5.       The proposed project would address institution-specific policy
issues through support for recent and ongoing reforms in BNDES, the federal



development bank, while other instruments are being used to address more
general financial sector policy issues (see para. 11). BNDES is a major
player in the Brazilian financial sector. Its assets represent 25? of the
assets of federally owned banks and 122 of total assets of the Brazilian
banking system. Moreover BNDES' equity represents 46X of the total equity
of federally owned banks and 252 of total equity of the Brazilian banking
system. At present BNDES is the main source of long-term investment credit
in Brazil and the largest development bank in Brazil with annual
disbursements of about US$4.5 billion.
6.       Following a recent reorganization, B1NES is eliminating many
policies that contributed to financial sector distortions. The stark
realities of public sector finances have forced BNDES in recent years to
redirect its lending from public sector enterprises towards private sector
firms. The proposed project would institutionalize the policy changes.
Other major policy changes are in the following areas:
7.       Credit Policy.  Until its reorganization, BNDES operated without
its own credit policy. Instead it depended on the judgment of the Central
Bank and the National Planning Secretariat (SEPLAN) concerning the
creditworthiness of borrowers. When lending to state-owned enterprises or
state banks, BNDES often accepted the government's guarantee in lieu of
determining the creditworthiness of its clients. As a result, BNDES, in
the 1950s through the 1970s, placed between 60Z-80Z of its resources with
public enterprises and banks. When they were unable to repay the loans,
the government had to honor its guarantee. BNDES has now established a
Credit Department to evaluate the creditworthiness of its customers. This
will support BNDES' orientation to the private sector.
8.       Resource Mobilization and Interest Rates.  In recent years the
share of mandatory savings programs of the government (such as PIS/PASEP)
as a percentage of BNDES' total new resources has fallen. These funds cost
BNDES just 6? over monetary correction. To compensate for the reduction in
PIS/PASEP funds, BNDES now is mobilizing resources in the market.
Domestically, BNDES raised over $1 billion in 1989 by issuing CDs and
commercial paper. BNDES has obtained funds from abroad at international
market rates by issuing debentures and by borrowing from private banks as
well as bilateral and multilateral organizations. Additionally, since 1987
BNDES has fully hedged its borrowings in foreign exchange by means of a
currency pooling system so that borrowers take the full cost of funds
including the exchange risk and intermediation costs. These changes in
resource mobilization have resulted in BNDES' increasing its lending rates
from an average of 71 (above monetary correction) in 1985 to 10.52 in 1989.
In 1990, the minimum lending rate is 9Z and the average is expected to be
11Z. BNDES' average cruzeiro lending rates are about four percentage
points above its average cruzeiro borrowing rates and significantly higher
than the real return on passbook savings accounts (6.32).
9. Increased Profitability and Portfolio Quality. Several financial
management policies have resulted in BNDES' record high $2.5 billion profit
in 1989 and will contribute to high profitability in the future. As BNDES'
lending rates increase over its fixed rate of borrowing, its profit margin
on lending will also increase. Together with its policy to fully hedge its
foreign exchange exposure, these policies will have a long-term salutary
effect on BNDES' financial position.  BNDES' policy to sell profitably its



equity investments also has had a positive, albeit shorter-run, beneficial
effect on income. BNDES recently undertook, with the help of its external
auditors, a thorough portfolio analysis. This analysis indicated that
nearly all BNDES' non-performing lending portfolio are with public sector
borrowers, most of which are slated for privatization. As of March 31,
1990, about 52 of its $22 billion lending portfolio is in arrears by 60
days or more. BNDES will settle these problems in the context of Brazil's
privatization program, which BNDES and its Presidernt are leading.
10.      Credit Segmentation.  BNDES no longer directs credit lines to
specific targets.  In the past, BNDES segmented credit according to
enterprise size, region, and whether the loan would be made directly or
through intermediaries. BNDES' internal reorganization is designed to
reduce this segmentation.  BNDES has streamlined its projects department so
that each potential loan will be appraised by sector specialists without
regard to company size, region, and whether the loan is to be made directly
or through intermediaries. It is also allowing financial intermediaries
discretion in the use of BNDES resources by setting a free limit for
projects where BNDES' participation would be limited to US$ 1.0 million.
This signals to financial intermediaries that they have more discretion in
allocating the funds which BNDES makes available through its second-tier
discounting activities.
11.      RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEI4ENT.  The Bank's assistance strategy in
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage long-term
economic growth and social development. Our emphasis is on efficient
resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector and delivery
of support systems to the poor. This loan is an important vehicle of the
Bank's strategy for reforming Brazil's financial sector. Because of the
breadth and complexity of the Brazilian financial sector, the Bank has
adopted a multi-pronged strategy which uses different instruments, in
complement with each other, to address different issues. This strategy
seeks to utilize (1) sectoral adjustment loans to support broad-based
financial reforms and (2) investment loans to reduce distortions in
specific institutions and markets of the financial sector. Instruments
supporting this strategy include a proposed financial sector reform
adjustment loan, and investment loans such as the Agricultural Credit
Project and the Fourth Agro-Industry Loan (Loans Nos. 2960 and 2971 of May
1988). Many of the reforms incorporated in the proposed Financial Reform
Loan already have been undertaken, since that adjustment loan was heavily
f-ont-loaded with policies. These include eliminating certain official
directed and subsidized credit programs, increasing competition in the
banking system by easing entry restrictions and reducing institutional
segmentation, improving transparency, strengthening banking regulations and
supervisory practices and reducing the number and average level of reserve
requirements. The proposed private sector finance loan complements these
reforms by addressing institution-specific reforms, particularly a
reduction of directed credit and the public sector's role in financial
markets. It is the first in a series of loans to support the BNDES
System's reorientation toward the private sector. A proposed follow-up
loan, the Privatization and Capital Markets Reform Project, will strengthen
the efforts of BNDESPAR (BNDES' subsidiary) to divest public sector
companies and reinvest in long-term equity of productive private sector
enterprises. The Bank's support would signal to BNDES' management and the
Government that BNDES' policy reforms are on target and merit continuation.



12.      PROJECT OBJECTIVES.  The objectives of this operation are to
support BNDES' efforts to reorient its focus to the private sector and
reduce its exposure to the public sector; to reduce credit segmentation:
and to strengthen credit policies and procedures. The loan will accomplish
these objectives by: (a) ensuring that BNDES continues to increase the
proportion of lending to private sector borrowers in its total lending, and
that its operations through financial intermediaries are undertaken
increasingly and predominantly through private sector intermediaries;
(b) supporting BNDES' reorganization which is designed to reduce BNDES'
directed credit lines and to finance financially and economically sound
projects; and (c) strengthening BNDES' credit, planning, and audit
departments.
13.      PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  The loan will finance technically,
financially and economically justified private investments without regard
to sector, region or company size. This loan will not be a directed line
of credit. The investment projects will be presented to BNDES either by
private investors or by private financial intermediaries representing
investors. When requesting Bank financing, BNDES will submit a subproject
appraisal report, including an assessment of the firms' or financial
agents' creditworthiness, that the Bank will evaluate prior to approving
the commitment of funds. BNDES will pass on to its borrowers the full cost
of IBRD funds including the foreign exchange risk plus a spread. The loan
will have a technical assistance component not to exceed US$0.5 million
equivalent for: (i) the Credit Department to improve its policies and
procedures; (ii) the Planning Department to support its program to develop
indicators of international competitiveness; and (iii) the Audit Department
to develop the capability and procedures for operational performance
auditing.
14.      BNDES could commit up to US$150 million of the loan for
subprojects in the first 12 months after Loan Effectiveness. At that time,
the Bank will review BNDES' performance over the past 12 months and next 12
months' plans in accordance with agreed criteria. If found satisfactory,
the balance of the loan will be available for commitment. Loan funds that
were not fully committed by the end of the next 12 months will become
available for commitment after the Bank's review of BNDES' performance and
the following year's plans. The criteria to be used to review BNDES'
performance and plans are: (a) that the BNDES system has reduced its flow
of credit to public sector borrowers from 362 and 272 in 1988 and 1989 to
232 and 192 in 1990 and 1991, respectively (in 1992, BNDES would limit the
flow of credit to the public sector to no more than the 1991 levels);  (b)
that the BNDES system has steadily reduced the participation of public
financial intermediaries in allocating the resources BNDES disburses
through financial intermediaries, from 582 and 50Z in 1988 and 1989 to 452
and 40Z in 1990 and 1991, respectively (in 1992, BNDES will limit the
public financial intermediaries participation to no more than the 1991
levels); and (c) that the spread between BNDES' yearly average cruzeiro
lending rates and its average cruzeiro borrowing rates provided a margin
sufficient to cover all its costs, prudent risk provisioning, and normal
profits. In 1989 this spread was about four percentage points. The
difference between BNDES' average and marginal cost of borrowings is
negligible.
15.      The project, to be carried out over four years, provides funds for
civil works; inventories, machinery and equipment; and training and



- a -
technical assistance. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$1.2
billion equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$300 million
(25Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursements schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
8793-BR, dated July 20, 1990 is also attached. The Bank would
retroactively finance, from January 1, 1990, up to US$30 million.
Retroactive financing would be justified to continue BNDES' program of
meeting its clients' strong demand for foreign exchange. Since funds from
the previous loan to BNDES (Loan 2488-BR) are about to become exhausted and
*          since the Bank is one of BNDES' few sources of foreign exchange,
retroactive financing is essential to avoid interrupting BNDES' program.
Moreover, the loan is based in part on BNDES' 1989 and 1990 targets and its
*          progress in meeting them.  As such, BNDES should have the benefit of the
loan proceeds for subproject disbursements it made throughout 1990, a
period in which BNDES would be fulfilling policy commitments it made to the
Bank.
16.      AGREED ACTIONS.  BNDES and the Bank have agreed on the procedures
and criteria to be used for the 12-month reviews of BNDES' performance and
plans (para. 14). BNDES has also agreed on the following: (i) BNDES will
finalize, by December 31, 1990, a detailed credit analysis training
program; (ii) the BNDES will establish and maintain a credit policy
including (a) overall credit limits for financial intermediaries by
December 31, 1990, and (b) policies and procedures for determining
creditworthiness and parameters for setting individual credit limits for
companies that deal directly with BNDES not later than 12 months after Loan
Effectiveness; (iii) BNDES will, by December 31, 1991, establish risk
management programs and furnish a report to the Bank assessing the
effectiveness of its policy for obtaining security for its loans; (iv)
BNDES and the Bank will review BNDES' lending portfolio, by December 31,
1991, to verify the progress made in reducing the arrears existing on March
31, 1990 and will furnish to the Bank a plan of action to settle any such
remaining arrears; (v) BNDES will continue to fully hedge its foreign
exchange exposure; (vi) BNDES will continue to use indexes which protect
the real value of its loans; and (vii) not later than 60 days after loan
effectiveness, BNDES will inform private financial intermediaries that Bank
loan funds are available and about the conditions of their use.
17.      BENEPITS.  The shift in BNDES' lending from the public to the
private sector is expected to result in an additional US$1.1 billion in
finance for the private sector from 1990 to 1992. By implementing a
creditworthiness policy and by increasing the participation of the private
sector, the project will improve the allocation of BNDES' resources towards
profitable investments and allow economically desirable industries to
emerge or expand nationwide. BNDES would be strengthened as a financial
institution by its increased private sector orientation and the quality of
its assets would be improved.
18.      RISKS.  Even though aggregate domestic demand may fall as a result
of the Government's new economic policies, it is likely that demand for
investment credit will be strong for two reasons: (i) firms will reorient
production for export markets and (ii) firms will face competition from



-9-
imports as a result of trade liberalization. To meet these challenges,
Brazilian industry will need to modernize its industrial plant; thus, we
expect strong demand for investment loan financing for imported machinery
and equipment.
19.      RECOMMENDATION.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCE PROJECT
Procurement and Disbursements
Procurement: The range of goods to be financed under the project would be
varied. Computers, being reserve procurement, would be excluded from Bank
financing. In the case of most subprojects, the items to be financed under
the project would not be suitable for bulk procurement. Accordingly,
procurement of machinery, equipment and inventories costing US$3 million or
less and civil works contracts below US$10 million would be in accordance
with standard practice for loans of this type and would follow the normal
commercial practices of private sector enterprises--the ultimate
beneficiaries of the loan. For procurement of machinery, equipment and
inventories for contract values higher than US$3 million but lower than
US$5 million, international shopping procedures would be required; and
international competitive bidding procedures would be required for the
procurement of goods for contract values of US$5 million and above.
International competitive bidding would be required for civil works for
contract values of US$10 million and above. The Brazilian construction and
capital goods industries are highly developed, and there is a significant
foreign participation in these industries. A small minority of subprojects
would be likely to involve substantial investment. For international
competitive bidding for goods, Brazilian suppliers would receive a 152
preference or the corresponding customs duty, whichever is lower, over
foreign suppliers.
