Description:  modernize and save energy in selected fertilizer
facilities; improve research planning in the fertilizer
industry; foster the beneficiary companies' capabilities to
implement projects, and manage operations and finances; and
develop strategies for modernizing medium-size fertilizer
plants. The Project consists of (a) rehabilitation,
modernization and energy-saving modifications in the
fertilizer plants of the five companies and training of
their staff; (b) equipment, data processing facilities and
training to strengthen the research and design capability
of CFDC and its member institutes; (c) a study, to be
conducted by MCI, of nitrogenous fertilizer production
costs; and (d) technical assistance in international
procurement.

The Project will lead to significant savings in specific
energy consumption, increase production of urea by 129,000
tpy, ammonium nitrate by 24,000 tpy, methanol by 29,000
tpy, surplus ammonia for sale by 14,000 tpy, and replace
production of about 180,000 tpy of sulfuric acid. Over its
economic life, the Project will generate a net foreign
exchange saving of US$694 million in January 1985 US
dollars. Technical risks are moderate as the project
investments will be in existing plants using commercially
proven technologies. The main risks of the Project are
possible delays in procurement and implementation. These
should, however, be minimized by the provision of
consultancy services for procurement and of experienced
engineering firms for project implementation. The
companies are financially sound and adequate measures are
provided for in the Project to maintain such soundness.

CHINA - FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the People's Republic of China (the Government,
GOC) has requested a Bank loan of US$97.0 million equivalent to finance the
Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project (the Project). The
Project aims at meeting two of the Government's major objectives concerniing
the industrial sector, namely (a) modernization of existing enterprises
particularly through adoption of new technology; and (b) industrial energy
conservation. The Project also aims at improving research and design
capabilities in the fertilizer sector.
1.02      The Project consists of four components:  (a) rehabilitation and
energy saving modifications in the operating fertilizer plants of the five
companies (Map IBRD 18561) located at Luzhou, Shuifu (Yunnan plant),
Cangzhou, Liaohe and Nanjing (the Plant Rehabilitation and Energy Saving
Component); (b) support for fertilizer research and development to the
China Fertilizer Development Center (CFDC) and eight fertilizer research
and design institutes affiliated to CFDC (the Fertilizer Research and
Development (CFDC) Component); (c) technical assistance for the project
implementation coordination unit in the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
(the Technical Assistance to MCI Component); and (d) nitrogenous fertilizer
production cost study. The Project will require total financing, including
physical and price contingencies and interest during construction, of about
US$186.8 million, with US$122.7 million in foreign exchange.  The proposed
Bank loan of US$97.0 million will cover 52.5% of the total financing (net
of taxes) and 79.1% of the total foreign exchange required.
1.03      The Project was appraised in July/August 1984 and January 1985 by
Messrs. S. Agarwal (Mission Chief), L. Borin, K. Song and N. Nizam
(Industry Department), S. Salman (Legal Department) and Mr. W. Fox
(Consultant).
II. THE CHINESE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A.   Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
2.01      Improved irrigation, better crop varieties and higher levels of
chemical fertilizer use have been the most important material inputs behind
China's good agricultural performance in recent years. Foodgrain
production dominates the Chinese agriculture and accounts for some 65% of
the total agricultural output and 80% of its cropland. Between 1952 and
1983, foodgrain output increased at an average annual rate of 2.8% or from
164 million tons per year (tpy) to 387 million tpy. Despite the country's
vast land area of about 960 million ha, only about 100 million ha or 10.4%
of the total are arable. About 45 million ha of the total arable area are
irrigated. China accounts for less than 8% of the world's arable land but



-2-
supports about 22% of the world's population. Applfcation rates for
chemical fertilizer almost doubled between 1978 and 1983 and, by 1983,
averaged about 115 kg of nutrients per sown ha. About 70% of available
fertilizer is used on grains and 30% on other crops. Consumption annual
growth rate of 13% on average for chemical fertilizer during 1972-1983 is
among the fastest registered for any developing country over a similar
period of time. Current application levels are more than three times those
in India, about equal to levels in the US and a third of those in Japan or
South Korea.
2.02      Fertilizer use in Clina has been stimulated by greater
availability (from both increased domestic production and higher imports)
and improvements in the level and structure of agricultural prices growing
out of the 1979 price reforms. The nutrients ratio of nitrogen: phosphate:
potash (N:P:K) for China (1983) of 100:32:5 compares unfavorably with the
world average of about 100:51:37. This serious nutrient imbalance in
China, i.e., low application of phosphate and potash reduces synergism and
the benefits from the relatively high levels of nitrogen use. There are
also disparities in fertilizer use among provinces with a range of 50 kg to
170 kg of nutrients per sown ha. Out of about 100 million ha of China's
cultivated land, only about a quarter is classified as high and stable
yield areas, another 40 million ha are medium yield and about one-third is
considered low-yielding areas. Fertilizer will obviously continue to be a
major factor contributing to future agricultural growth within an
environment of unchanged cultivated area. The question is whether
inability to increase supplies especially of phosphate and potash
fertilizers rapidly enough can be anticipated to be a major constraint on
growth (para 2.10).
B.   Fertilizer Demand and Supply
2.03      Historical production, consumption and imports of chemical
fertilizers in China for the period 1972 to 1983 are given in Annex 2-1 and
are summarized in the table on the following page.

2.04      Fertilizer Demand.  Consumption of all fertilizers increased from
4.2 million tons per year of nutrlents (tpyn) in 1972 to about 16.3 million
tpyn In 1983, at an annual average rate of 13% per annum (p.a.). Of the
total consumption in 1983, 73% was nitrogen, 23% phosphate and 4% potash.
Nitrogen consumption grew at an annual average rate of 16Z during 1972 -
1980, but remained static during the 1980-82 period due principally to the
Government's emphasis on encouraging the consumption of phosphate and
potash fertilizers to improve overall nutrient balance, and very little
increase in domestic nitrogen production In that period. Nitrogen
consumption In 1983 was significantly higher by 14.42 due to Increased
nitrogen production. Phosphate consumption, after Increasing at an annual
average rate of 11% during 1972-1980, grew further at 19% p.a. during
1980-1982 but slowed to 12% in 1983. Potash consumption, except in 1983,
has grown at a much faster rate during the last decade due to the
negligible base in the early 1970s. China also has a long history of using
organic fertilizers and, until very recently, organics probably supplied a
major share (about 50%) of total nutrients from fertilizers, and continue
to be important sources of nutrients particularly for P, K and some trace
elements.
2.05      Although the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) is still being
finalized, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery
expects the chemical fertilizer demand to grow at an annual average rate of
4% to about 21.4 million tpyn by 1990. If, as the Government envisages,
the N:P:K nutrients ratio of about 100:50:20 were to be achieved compared
with 100:32:5 in 1983, consumption in 1990 would consist of about 13
million tons of N, 6.1 million tons of P205 and 2.3 million tons of K20.
This would correspond to a very low growth rate of 1.2% p.a. in nitrogen
consumption due to the already high nitrogen application levels.



- 4 -
The high forecast growth in potash consumption (22% p.a. during 1983-1990),
while desirable and necessary for improved nutrient balance, appears
optimistic, especially in view of the large gap between consumption and
domestic production that would be involved (about 2.2 million tons of
nutrient in 1990). Phosphate consumption will have to increase at an
annual average rate of 7%, which is also an optimistic target. In any
event, it is expected that the nitrogenous fertilizer demand will increase
at a low pace, whereas demand for phosphate and potash fertilizers will
increase at a muc1i faster rate.
2.06      Fertilizer Production.  China is the world's third largest
producer of chemical fertilizers after USSR and USA. Chemical fertilizer
production in China has increased from 3.7 million tpyn in i972 to 13.8
million tpyn in 1983 from some 2,000 plants, with a wide range of
production technologies and sizes. Most of the plants are of very small
size and with outdated technologies. The substantial nitrogen capacity,
built over the last 30 years, includes some 1,200 small plants
(5,000-60,000 tpy ammonia capacity), about 55 medium-size plants
(60,000-150,000 tpy ammonia capacity), and 13 large ammonia/urea plants
built in the 1970s with foreign know-how and substantially imported plant
and equipment, each of about 281,000-330,000 tpy of ammonia and
535,000-575,000 tpy of urea capacity. One more indigenously built large
plant has a capacity of 330,000 tpy ammonia and 267,000 tpy urea, marketing
the surplus ammonia for industrial use. The small-, medium- and large-size
nitrogen fertilizer plants account for about 60%, 17% and 23%,
respectively, of total nitrogen fertilizer production. This evolution
reflects mainly the technologies available at the time of plant
construction and China's decision during the early phase of the development
of the fertilizer industry to rely on indigenous technology to the extent
possible. The average capacity utilization for the 13 large nitrogen
plants in 1983 was 81%, with five plants operating below 80% capacity due
to constraints in feedstock supplies (natural gas and naphtha). The
operation of the only indigenously built large nitrogen plant has so far
suffered due to technical problems. Except for 8 plants each with capacity
exceeding 200,000 tpy of low grade Phosphate fertilizers, the phosphate
capacity consists of a large number of plants (about 700) with capacity
ranging mainly between 10,000 and 100,000 tpy of low grade products. China
has only one small potash fertilizer plant. Domestic fertilizer production
in China is characterized by a small number of product types and low
average nutrient content. In the case of nitrogen fertilizer, about 58% of
the production is ammonium bicarbonate with 17.5% N. Main features of
China's fertilizer industry, i.e., types of fertilizer products, feedstock
for nitrogenous fertilizers, plant capacity and technologies, and energy
consumption levels for ammonia production are summarized in Annex 2-2.
2.07      Nitrogenous fertilizer production grew rapidly (19.2% p.a.)
during 1972 to 1980 when the large ammonia/urea plants were built and
commissioned. During 1980-1982, little new capacity was added. Again in
1983, production increased by about 9% mainly from the small- and medium-
size plants. Phosphate fertilizer production picked up only in the 1960s
and increased at an annual average growth rate of 8% during 1972-1980 but



-5
slowed during 1980-83. Production of potash fertilizer began only in the
1970s.
2.08      The Government has targeted for total nutrient production by 1990
of about 17.1 million tons, of which 13 million tons are for nitrogen, 4
million tons phosphate and 0.1 million tons potassium fertilizers. This
implies a modest growth of 2.3% p.a. for nitrogen. The targeted phosphate
fertilizer outpu. envisages about 6% p.a. growth which may not be easy to
achieve. Pbtash output is projected to more than triple by 1990 but will
still remain very small.
2.09      Out of the four large nitrogenous fertilizer plants based on
residue oil and coal, which have been under construction with initial
delays in 1980 and 1981 due to domestic financial constraints, one was
completed in late 1984. The second plant is scheduled for completion in
mid-1985 and the remaining two plants are to be completed by 1987. Present
plans for additional phosphate fertilizer production include six plants
(including a joint venture project with Kuwait and Tunisia) with a total
capacity of 200,000 tpy of triple superphosphate, 280,000 tpy of
nitrophosphates, and 960,000 tpy of diammonium phosphate. The above
capacity additions for phosphate fertilizers will be inadequate to meet
China's fertilizer needs up to 1990.
2.10      Fertilizer Denand and Supply Balance.  About 852 of China's total
consumption of chemical fertilizers in 1983 was produced domestically (93%
for nitrogen, 70% for phosphate and 5% for potash). Despite the impressive
build up in production capacity during the last decade, fertilizer imports,
in 1983, were 3.4 million nutrient tons and have averaged about 2.5
million tpyn in recent years, at a value over US$l billion p.a. making
Cina one of the world's largest importers of fertilizers. While domestic
nitrogen production and consumption are expected to be about in balance by
1990, deficits of phosphate and potash fertilizer will substantially
increase. The gap between domestic production and consumption - to be met
by imports, is expected to increase from 2.5 million tpyn in 1983 to about
4.3 million tpyn in 1990, or from 15% to about 20% of requirements plus
provision to cover fertilizer in transit, stocks and distribution losses.
C.   Energy Consumption
2.11      Generally energy consumption in China's nitrogenous fertilizer
plants is higher than today's levels for modern plants by about 11-16% for
large-scale, 26-30% for medium-size, and 17-25% for small-size plants
(Annex 2-2). The large plants were built in the 1970s and, therefore, do
not incorporate the technological improvements now available to minimize
energy consumption. Substantial possibilities also exist for energy saving
in the 55 medium-size plants, which require substantial process
modifications in view of their age and obsolete technology. The small-size
nitrogen plants (about 1,200 in total) consume about 46% more energy
compared with the more efficient anthracite/coke based medium-size plants
now being designed. Given the age, obsolete technology and broad range of
process configuration of the small plants, the most appropriate energy
efficiency measures are limited to better management and maintenance.



-6-
2.12      The problem of high energy consumption in fertilizer industry can
be solved only gradually as it requires substantial capital investment in
technical renovation and some restructuring of the industry. The
Government has assigned high priority to technical rehabilitation of and
energy efficiency improvements in the fertilizer plants, and has adopted a
number of policy measures--both administrative and price incentives, to
improve industrial energy efficiency. Cutbacks in planned allocations of
energy to major industrial users appear to have been the most frequently
applied measures thus far. Energy consumption norms have been gradually
reduced and more strictly applied. When an enterprise succeeds in reducing
its energy consumption below the quota, bonuses are paid, but if the
enterprise cannot lower energy consumption to the quota limit, it cau bbuy
additional energy, if available, only at higher prices. Some very
inefficient plants have been closed down. Fifty-five energy conservation
centers have been established throughout the country to provide industrial
enterprises with technical assistance in improving energy efficiency. The
Government has also recently introduced some price increases such as for
natural gas and coal including increased taxation on petroleum fuels to
encourage both conservation and fuel substitution.  The present energy
prices (para 2.16) are, however, not fully conducive to energy
conservation. Appropriate reform of the price system especially of energy
prices, complemented with improvements in the effectiveness of the
remaining administrative measures, should provide further incentives for
more rational and efficient energy consumption.
D. Fertilizer Pricing
2.13      Both ex-factory and farmgate prices of fertilizers, like for
other essential commodities in China, are administered by the National
Comm-dities Price Bureau, which functions as an independent entity under
the supervision and guidance of the State Council. Ex-factory prices of
urea and ammonium nitrate (AN), produced by the nationally and provincially
managed fertilizer plants, are uniform throughout China. Ex-factory prices
of other nitrogen fertilizers mainly ammonium bicarbonate, produced by
small-size plants which are managed by county governments, communes and
production brigades, are administered by the county governments; they are
given some freedom to vary them from the n&-ionally recommended levels
depending on local conditions. The ex-factory prices of trrea and AN, which
had remained unchanged since mid-1970s, were increased in February 1984,
from Y 350/ton (US$125) to Y 400/ton (US$143) or by 14% in the case of
bagged urea, and from Y 220/ton (US$79) to Y 270/ton (US$96) or by 22% for
bagged AN. These increases were to cover the increase in raw materials'
prices and to reflect consumer preferences. The ex-factory price of
ammonium bicarbonate generally ranges between Y 130 and Y 150/ton
(US$46-54). The ex-factory prices of urea and AN and the delivered prices
of main energy inputs  . January 1985, along with their international
prices are given in Annex 2-3.
2.14      Ex-factory fertilizer prices in China (January 1985) are 77% for
urev. and 59Z for fertilizer grade AN of the FOB international prices.  On
the basis of landed prices at Shanghai, they amount to LIZ and 48% for urea
and fertilizer grade AN, respectively.  DDmeitic prices are thus lower than
international prices, principally because energy input Prices in China are
also lower than economic prices. Domestic relative prices of fertilizers
and energy inputs are, however, in line with international relative prices



(para 2.16). The Government's policy on ex-factory fertilizer pricing is
to cover on average full production costs and provide a profit margin of
about 17% after product tax on sales. Fertilizer prices in the past have
provided satisfactory financial returns on investments.
2.15      While prices currently play only a limited role in resource
allocation and consumer decisions, the Government has become increasingly
aware that without overall price reforms and an increased role for market
forces, efforts to revitalize enterprise planning and management through
financial reforms cannot succeed. The two main elements of the
Government's October 1984 decision to reform the economic structure thus
relate to overall price reforms and a decrease in the Government's direct
control of the economy. However, due to its importance in the national
economy, fertilizer production will continue to be planned by the
Government and its prices will remain administered.
2.16      Price reforms are of particular importance in the fertilizer
sector as ex-factory prices should reflect adjustments in the pricing of
energy-a major input for fertilizer production. The Government is keenly
aware of the need for rationalization of energy prices, and this is an
important element of the Bank's ongoing economic dialogue with the
Government. In 1984, gas prices for fertilizer production were increased
by 43% for the Luzhou and Yunnan plants, and by 74% for the Cangzhou plant,
and in early 1985 by 64% for the Liaohe plant. Coal prices for the Nanjing
plant were also increased by 18% in 1984. Nevertheless, current natural
gas prices for the four gas-based fertilizer plants under the Project are
on average about 60% of the economic value of fuel oil equivalent in
calorific terms. Similarly, the price of anthracite for the Nanjing plant
is about 60% of its economic value. Large increases in domestic energy
prices resulting from rationalization of the energy pricing structure would
alter relative prices between fertilizer and energy inputs, and also have a
noticeable impact on the financial viability of nitrogen producing
companies. However, in line with the Government's October.1984 decision on
economic reforms, the adjustment in fertilizer prices to offset increased
energy prices will be only partial as the plants will be expected to
increase their efficiency and reduce energy consumption. The Government
considers the proposed Project as a model to prepare industrial enterprises
for the new incentive regime of the price structure by improving their
energy efficiency and minimizing production costs.
2.17      Farmgate prices of fertilizers have also not changed
during the last decade except in February 1984 when the prices of urea and
AN were increased by about 13% and 16%, respectively, following an increase
in their ex-factory prices. The farmgate urea price at Y 510/ton
(US$182/ton) is 78% of the present import CIF price of about US$233/ton.
The farmgate price of AN at Y 360/ton (US$129/ton) is 64% of the present
CIF price of about US$202/ton. Farmgate nitrogen fertilizer price relative
to the price of wheat is in line with international levels. The present
farmgate fertilizer prices are higher than ex-factory prices and margins
are adequate on the average to cover marketing and distribution costs. It
is expected that as ex-factory prices are adjusted to reflect economic
energy input prices, farmgate fertilizer prices will also be adjusted
accordingly.

E. Fertilizer Allocation System
2.18      The state system of allocating fertilizer has been used as a
policy instrument co encourage production and marketing of key agricultural
commodities (food grains). Allocation process in the past has favored
foodcrops, the high, stable yield and irrigated areas and state farms, and
fertilizer supplies typically go to intensively cultivated areas where
application rates and yields are high. Marginal yield responses in some
high yield areas are reported to have declined from 15-25 kg of grain per
kg of nitrogen in the 1960s to 5-10 kg of grain today. As a result, the
Government is becoming increasingly aware that the present fertilizer
allocation system, which may have been economically rational when nitrogen
fertilizer application rates were low, is much less efficient due to
declining marginal yield responses to nitrogen application. To correct
this problem, the Government plans to allocate in the future a higher
proportion of the incremental fertilizer production to crops and production
zones outside the high, stable yield areas, where marginal yield responses
to fertilizer application are expected to be higher.  The Bank is pursuing
the dialogue on this aspect with the Government in the context of its
agricultural sector work and agricultural lending operations.
2.19      There is also a need to increase application of phosphate and
potash relative to nitrogen to achieve higher responses in the high
yielding localities, which accounted for a large portion of the increase in
fertilizer consumption in recent years. Under the recent -production
responsibility system" of contracting responsibilities to households or
other production groups, the farmers have now become more responsive to the
relative costs and benefits of various inputs and can be expected to favor
in the future the increased use of phosphate and potash, and fertilizer
application in areas where marginal returns are higher.
2.20      Farm sales of chemical fertilizer, in accordance with the
national fertilizer allocation plan, are made by the Agricultural Means of
Production Corporation, a state-owned company of the Ministry of Commerce
through an extensive network of wholesale offices and retail shops. The
China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation is responsible for
most imports of fertilizers, which are then distributed by the Agricultural
Means of Production Corporation. Fertilizer is usually transported
directly from the plants to a network of warehouses close to the consuming
areas to minimize transport and handling costs. In the past, with general
scarcity of chemical fertilizers and only nitrogenous fertilizers to
distribute, a system of rationed distribution was easier to administer and
could serve efficiency objectives. Today, with more abundant nitrogen but
continuing scarcities of phosphate and potash, there is strong reason to
allow the market to play a large role in allocating fertilizers. The most
critical task for the Government is to develop fertilizer testing programs
and related extension network, involving both economic and technical
considerations, which could guide the processes of fertilizer production,
distribution and utilization. Priorities for fertilizer imports should be
closely aligned with the nutrient needs established by research.



-9-
F.  Government Strategy in the Fertilizer Sector
2.21      The three main elements of the Government's priorities in the
fertilizer sector are: (a) in nitrogen, rehabilitation and energy saving
in existing capacity; (b) in phosphate, rapid capacity expansion based on
locally available rock phosphate; and (c) in potash fertilizers,
identification and development of domestic resources. For nitrogenous
fertilizer, the Government's strategy is to undertake programs to improve
efficiency of the existing plants especially of the large- and medium-size
nitrogen fertilizer plants, through energy efficiency measures and
technical rehabilitation. Energy conservation is an important element of
the Government's efforts to ease the problem of energy shortages which
poses a severe constraint to China's future economic growth. Since most of
the existing plants are old and do not benefit from recent developments in
technology and energy saving measures, there is very large potential for
improvements in this area. There are also plans to convert some of the
existing ammonium bicarbonate medium-size plants to produce high nutrient
fertilizers. The Government's plans are to use the rehabilitation and
energy saving measures under the Project as a model in developing and
implementing similar investments in other large- and medium-size fertilizer
plants. Energy consumption of small-size nitrogen fertilizer plants is
also very high, which mainly produce low nutrient ammonium bicarbonate.
The Government recognizes that they are less economic and has recently
closed about 300 such plants. There are no plans to build new small-size
plants in the future. While more plants can be expected to be closed,
considering the large country size and that they make use of local raw
materials and serve a market area within a radius of about 25 km from the
plants, the Chinese small nitrogen plants will continue to have an
important role to play for some time in the future. Their efficiency is
being improved through retrofitting and some increase in capacity where
economically feasible. While no significant new nitrogen capacity has yet
been planned, large nitrogen fertilizer plants can be built based on recent
natural gas finds, especially south of Hainan Island in the South China Sea
for both domestic consumption and exports (Annex 2-2).
2.22      China's low application levels of phosphate and potash
fertilizers will have to be substantially increased in order to improve
crop response and increase agriculture production. Despite the large raw
material availability in China and the present relatively low consumption,
local production capacity of phosphate and potash fertilizers is totally
insufficient to meet demand. The Government's strategy is to rapidly
expand phosphate fertilizer production capacity based on phosphate reserves
which have yet to be fully exploited due to difficulties in both mining and
processing and the need for substantial infrastructure. The Bank is
financing technical assistance under the IDA-financed Technical Cooperation
Credit (1412-CHA) for testing of phosphate rock and necessary feasibility
studies for preparing a phosphate mine project. There is, however, need to
optimize investments in the subsector by linking exploitation of phosphate
rock mines to the development of the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing
capacity based on integrated development including minimization of
transportation costs. The Bank has proposed to the Government an outline
of a phosphate subsector investment planning study and has offered to
finance assistance for it under the Technical Cooperation Credit. Domestic



- 10 -
deposits of potash are limited to the Qarhan Lake in the Qinghai Province,
where a one million tpy potassium chloride plant is planned for eventual
construction, and will be adequate to satisfy about one-fourth of China's
needs for potash fertilizer up to 2000. In the foreseeable future, China
is expected to continue to import large quantities of phosphate and potash
fertilizers.
G.   Bank Role in the Sector and Project Justification
2.23      The Bank's major objectives in the fertilizer sector are to
support the Government's efforts toward (a) technical renovation and
energy saving measures in nitrogen fertilizer; (b) improvements in the
nutrient balance through capacity expansion in the phosphate ferti.Azer
subsector; and (c) institution building and training. The proposed Project
would be a first step in furthering these objectives. The technical
rehabilitation and energy saving component has been designed to provide
experience to China which will permit it to formulate and implement similar
programs for other ammonia plants. The Bank has played a major role in
project design in working with the Chinese officials in the optimization of
the rehabilitation component using economic analysis, and in institution
building by ensuring close involvement of MCI, the project entities and
design institutes in project preparation and appraisal. The Bank has also
assisted in defining the scope of CFDC's activities in research and design
for the fertilizer industry. Bank participation will contribute to
improved financial managemenl of the conpanies through their use of
appropriate financial performance criteria and strengthen capabilities in
project implementation and plan; operations. The outcome of the fertilizer
production cost study will help provide a basis for formulating strategies
to modernize medium-size nitrogen fertilizer plants. The Government has
also requested Bank assistance for a phosphate mine project. Continued
Bank assistance for fertilizer development will be necessary and is
justified considering the critical link between the fertilizer and
agriculture sectors, and the large needs of China's fertilizer industry for
technical renovation and energy saving investments and for development of
the phosphate fertilizer subsector.
III. THE PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
3.01      The Project involves five chemical fertilizer companies:  Luzhou
Natural Gas Chemical Company (LNGCC), Yunnan Natural Gas Chemical Company
(YNGCC), Cangzhou Chemical Fertilizer Company (CCFC), Liaohe Chemical
Fertilizer Company (LCFC), and Nanjing Chemical Industry Company (NCIC).
They are state-owned industrial enterprises under the supervision of the
Ministry of Chemical industry (MCI) and their respective provincial
governments, and operate as distinct legal and independent accounting
entities. The four fertilizer complexes owned by LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC and
LCFC are among the 13 large ammonia/urea complexes built in the 1970s with
foreign know-how and substantially imported equipment. In addition, the
Project involves the China Fertilizer Development Center (CFDC) and CFDC's
eight member fertilizer research and design institutes, which are also
state-owned and operate under the jurisdiction of MCI.



- 11 -
3.02      The five fertilizer companies, similar to all state-owned
industrial enterprises, have been constrained in the past in both
managerial and financial autonomy, specifically: (a) their annual
production targets are set by MCI taking into account targets fixed for the
fertilizer sector by the State Planning Commission (SPC); (b) major inputs
are allocated from designated sources at pre-determined prices; (c)
outputs are marketed as directed and at prices administered by the
Government; and (d) investment plans and budgets are approved by SPC, MCI
and respective provincial governments. As part of the on-going economic
reforms, the Government has recently begun to introduce changes in the
planning and financial regulations to provide more autonomy to industrial
enterprises mainly to encourage better operational and financial
efficiency. While the fertilizer sector, due to its Importance in the
national economy, will continue to be planned by the L,overnment, on-going
reforms in the financial regulations (tax system, remittances to the
Government, profit retention, etc.) would provide increased freedom to the
management of the five companies and incentives to improve their
operational efficiency (para 7.03).
3.03      Detailed description of the existing plant facilities, the recent
trend of production and capacity utilization of the five companies, and of
their organization and management is given in Annex 3. The organization
charts of the five companies and CFDC are given in Project File. The
management and staff of LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC, LCFC, NCIC and CFDC are
competent and able to implement the Project efficiently. Chapter VII
reviews the financial performance of the companies. A brief description of
the companies' existing facilities and of CFDC is given below.
3.04      The Luzhou Natural Gas Chemical Company (LNGCC) has two
ammonia/urea plants. The medium-size plant, commissioned in 1966 (the old
plant), has a capacity of 300 tons per day (tpd) ammonia and 500 tpd urea.
The large plant, commissioned in 1977 (the new plant), has a capacity of
1,000 tpd ammonia and 1,620 tpd urea. Since its start-up, the large plant
has operated satisfactorily at about 90% capacity utilization. There is,
however, scope for reducing energy consumption for ammonia production by
about 8%, and for improving recovery of urea while reducing pollution (para
4.03(i)). The medium-size plant has been in operation for nearly 20 years
and as a result can benefit from rehabilitation measures. Since it is
based on technology of the early 1960s, the energy consumption per ton of
ammonia and steam consumption in the urea plant are high. Because of the
technical problems and shortage of natural gas from the Sichuan gas
network, the old ammonia plant has been able to operate only at about 80B
capacity during the last four years except in 1982 when capacity
utilization was about 50% due to technical problems. Energy saving from
modifications in both the old and new plants under the Project will make
available gas savings that would permit 50% capacity expansion of the old
plant while maintaining overall natural gas consumption substantially at
present levels (Annex 4-4).
3.05      The Yunnan Natural Gas Chemical Company (YNGCC) has four plants:
ammonia (1,000 tpd capacity), urea (1,620 tpd), nitric acid (240 tpd) and
ammonium nitrate (333 tpd). The ammonia and urea plants were commissioned
in 1978 and the nitric acid and ammonium nitrate units in 1981. Ammonia
production has remained at about 80% of capacity in recent years due to



- 12 -
interruptions in natural gas supply from the Sichuan gas network. The
plant also consumes much more energy than necessary, and there is scope for
improving recovery of urea while reducing pollution (para 4.03 (ii)).
After the Project, capacity utilization will increase to 89% as energy
savings would release additional gas for increased production.
3.06      The Cangzhou Chemical Fertilizer Company's (CCFC) ammonia/urea
plant, commissioned in 1978, has capacity of 1,000 tpd and 1,620 tpd of
ammonia and urea, respectively. CCFC's operations have been affected
significantly in recent years mainly by the shortage of natural gas, due to
declining production from the Dagang oil fields. A gas pipeline scheduled
for completion by end-1985 will provide the Cangzhou plant adequate gas
from the Zhongyuan oil fields (Henan Province) to supplement gas available
from the Dagang oil fields to operate the facilities at 86% of the capacity
(Annex 4-4). However, the plant consumes much more energy than necessary,
and there is scope for improving recovery of urea while reducing
pollution (para 4.03 (iii)).
3.07      The Liaohe Chemical Fertilizer Company (LCFC) started fertilizer
production in 1976. The ammonia and urea plants have a daily capacity of
1,000 tpd and 1,620 tpd, respectively. Capacity utilization has been
maintained at high levels except in 1982, when it was 70% due to
interruptions in water supply; this problem has been corrected.
Availability of gas from the Panjing oil field for the Liaohe plant is
expected to remain adequate through the project life to operate the
facilities at full load. Rowever,the plant consumes much more energy than
necessary, and there is scope for improving recovery of urea while reducing
pollution (para 4.03 (iv)).
3.08      The Nanjing Chemical Industry Company (NCIC) is a large company
with diverse activities. Its operations include nitrogenous and phosphate
fertilizers, catalyst manufacturing, machine building, cement, plant
erection and maintenance, and chemical research and design institutes.
NCIC consists of 13 subsidiary plants/units with revenue generating units
as independent profit centers. The nitrogenous fertilizer plant,
originally built in 1937 as a very small-size plant, has been expanded and
modified many times. The annual production capacity of the main units is
120,000 tpy ammonia, 120,000 tpy ammonium nitrate, 110,000 tpy ammonium
bicarbonate, and 270,000 tpy sulfuric acid after the shutdown of one of the
four existing sulfuric acid lines at the end of 1983 due to its age and
corrosion and wear. Recent production of the ammonia and related units has
been stable partly due to the unique plant configuration (in many cases
oversized equipment and significant standby capacities, and impressive
captive capability for building machinery for replacements). Despite such
operational flexibility, many components of the ammonia unit are worn out
and as a result the plant efficiency has declined resulting in high energy
consumption. One more line of the sulfuric acid plant will be shut down in
1988 upon completion of a new sulfuric acid plant under the Project (para
4.03 (v)).
3.09      China Fertilizer Development Center (CFDC).  Research and
development work in the fertilizer sector and responsibility for design and
engineering in China are shared by several chemical research and design
institutes specializing in specific areas. Eight such regional and major



- 13 -
research and design institutes report to MCI, which has been aware for some
time of the need to coordinate their research and design activities to (a)
avoid overlapping or duplication of efforts; (b) provide a focus to
research planning activities; and (c) build up relevant expertise in
specialized fields in priority areas. There is also need for: (i)
training and technical assistance to build and upgrade knowledge of recent
technological advances and to improve design capabilities; (ii) acquiring
up-to-date equipment for research in fertilizers; and (iii) improving data
handling, processing and analysis capabilities. CFDC was established in
January 1984 to coordinate the above needs with a membership which includes
eight chemical research and design institutes. CFDC's objectives,
organization and management and areas for future research are given in   -
Annex 3.
3.10      CFDC recognizes that the present activities of the member
institutes can be adjusted to achieve proper coordination only gradually.
The Government has assured that it will cause CFDC to furnish to the Bank
for the Bank's review and comments (a) by October 31, 1985, its four-year
research and development plan including coordinated allocation of work
among CFDC's eight member research and design institutes for the period
1986-1990; and (b) by October 31 of each year starting 1986 and up to 1990,
its annual research and development plan for the next year including an
assessment of achievements during the previous year.
IV.   THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the Project are to assist China in (a)
implementing rehabilitation and energy saving measures in nitrogenous
fertilizer plants of the five companies; (b) strengthening the beneficiary
companies' capabilities in project implementation, plant operations and
financial management; (c) strengthening the newly established CFDC and
fertilizer research and design institutes for improved research and
engineering capabilities in the fertilizer industry; and (d) developing
strategies for modernization of the mediur-size nitrogen fertilizer
plants. As noted earlier, the rehabilitation and energy saving measures
under the Project are expected to have a significant demonstration effect
for developing and implementing similar energy saving programs in China's
other large- and redium-size fertilizer plants. The Project will thus
support the Government's efforts to prepare industrial enterprises for
efficient operations under the reformed economic structure by improving
their energy efficiency and minimizing production costs.
B.   Project Description
4.02      The Project includes four components:  (a) plant rehabilitation
and energy saving component covering fertilizer plants of the five
companies; (b) fertilizer research and development component covering CFDC
and its eight member research and design institutes; Cc) technical
assistance to the project implementation coordination unit of MCI; and (d)
a nitrogenous fertilizer production cost study to be carried out by MCI.

1.   Plant Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component
4.03      The rehabilitation and energy saving component covers five
fertilizer complexes belonging to the five companies-LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC,
LCFC and NCIC. The modifications and improvements are based on studies and
proposals prepared by: (a) M. W. Kellogg (US) (MWK) for the energy saving
modifications in the large ammonia plants at Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou and
Liaohe; these modifications will be designed to allow for a possible 10%
capacity expansion of the plants in the future; (b) Snamprogetti (Italy)
for the large urea plants in the same location as the ammonia plants; (c)
Humphreys and Glasgow (UK) (HG) for the medium-size ammonia plant at
Luzhou; and (d) UTI (US), Mbntedison (Italy) and Toyo (Japan) for the
medium-size urea plant at Luzhou. HG has also carried out an inspection of
the old ammonia plant at Luzhou, financed from the IDA-financed Technical
Cooperation Credit (1412-CHA), to define the required rehabilitation work.
These studies have been reviewed by the management of each plant, the
domestic design institutes and the technical team of MCI. The
modifications and improvements for the Nanjing fertilizer plant were
identified and prepared by NCIC and the Nanjing Design Institute, and
reviewed by the MCI technical team as well as by international
consultants. The Bank staff have discussed the proposed modifications and
suggested adjustments as necessary to optimize the project design. Project
scope of the plant rehabilitation and energy saving com;.jnent is given in
Annex 4-1. The plant rehabilitation and energy saving part of the Project
includes five subcomponents as discussed below:
(i) Luzhou Subcomponent: (a) implementation of energy saving
modifications in the large 1,000 tpd ammonia plant; (b) installation of a
hydrolysis unit and a low pressure absorption system in the large 1,620 tpd
urea plant to reduce pollution and recover 8,000 tpy urea from liquid
effluents; (c) implementation of revamping and energy saving measures, and
expansion of capacity by 50% in the old, medium-size ammonia/urea plant
(present capacity of 300 tpd ammonia and 500 tpd urea); (d) spare parts to
maintain production at capacity; (e) process simulator, laboratory
equipment and audio-visual aids for the training facilities at Luzhou; and
(f) training abroad for about 52 staff in process operations and
maintenance and through participation during basic engineering of the old
ammonia/urea plant (155 man-months), and visits by foreign experts to China
to provide training in process control and maintenance (8 man-months).
(ii) Yunnan Subcomponent: (a) implementation of energy saving
modifications in the 1,000 tpd ammonia plant; (b) installation of a
hydrolysis unit in the 1,620 tpd urea plant to reduce pollution and recover
5,000 tpy urea; (c) spare parts to maintain production at capacity; and (d)
training abroad for about 15 persons in process operations and maintenance
(45 man-months).
(iii) Cangzhou Subcomponent: (a) implementation of energy saving
modifications in the 1,000 tpd ammonia plant; (b) installation of a
hydrolysis unit in the 1,620 tpd urea plant to reduce pollution and recover
5,000 tpy of urea; (c) a process control system to improve operation of the
ammonia plant; and (d) training abroad for about 17 persons in operations
and maintenance (50 man-months). CCFC will sell about 20,000 tpy of
surplus ammonia starting in 1988 to a 480,000 tpy diammonium phosphate



- 15 -
plant to be built in Qinhuangdao (Hebei Province) as a joint venture
project by China, Kuwait and Tunisia.
(iv)  Liaohe Subcomponent:  (a) implementation of energy saving
modifications in the 1,000 tpd ammonia plant; (b) installation of a hydro-
lysis unit in the 1,620 tpd urea plant to reduce pollution and recover
5,000 tpy of urea; (c) addition of a dehydrogenation unit to the C02 gas
stream to the urea plant to improve plant safety and increase urea produc-
tion by 3,000 tpy; and (d) training abroad for about 17 persons in opera-
tions and maintenance (50 man-months). Although LCFC will sell hydrogen
from the purge gas recovery unit (one of the five energy saving modifica-
tions in the ammonia plant) to a refinery of the Panjing Oil Company, it
will have the flexibility to utilize the recovered hydrogen gas if
required.
(v) Nanjing Subcomponent: (a) addition of an anthracite-
gasification line to the existing 9 lines, installation of a syngas com-
pressor, and replacement and improvement of equipment in the ammonia plant
as required. The ammonia production will increase to 150,000 tpy or by
more than 25%; (b) improvements in the ammonium nitrate plant and addition
of a 50,000 tpy porous granular ammonium nitrate unit to produce industrial
grade ammonium nitrate; (c) installation of a 200,000 tpy single-train
Pyrites-based sulfuric acid plant to replace two obsolete lines, one of
which was shut down in 1983 and the other to be shut down in 1988; (d)
improvements in plant utilities (power, water and steam), offsites and
environmental system; and (e) training aids including audio-visual aids and
process simulators, microcomputers and training abroad for about 20 staff
in operations and maintenance and management (60 man-months).
4.04      The plant rehabilitation and energy saving component will also
provide for overseas visits by staff of each of the five companies, domes-
tic design institutes and MCI for engineering and procurement, i.e., equip-
ment inspection for each of the five subcomponents (about 70 man-months).
4.05      The main benefits from the plant rehabilitation and energy saving
component are summarized in Annex 4-2. The Project will (a) result in sig-
nificant savings in specific energy consumption of natural gas, anthracite
and electricity for ammonia production; and (b) increase production through
rehabilitation of the plants. Energy consumption per ton of ammonia for
feedstock and fuel will decrease between 6% to 14% and for electricity
between 4% to 20%. The Project will also increase production of urea by
129,000 tpy, methanol by 29,000 tpy, ammonium nitrate by 24,000 tpy, and
surplus ammonia for sale by 14,000 tpy, and replace production of 180,000
tpy of sulfuric acid.
2.   Fertilizer Research and Development (CFDC) Component
4.06      The CFDC component will provide (a) research equipment and
scientific instruments for CFDC's eight member research and design insti-
tutes to expand their capabilities for fertilizer research and design work
in several areas including chemical analysis of fertilizers, compound
fertilizers, production processes, phosphate rock, sulfuric acid,
catalysts, energy efficiency improvements and pollution control and
engineering design; (b) computer hardware/software facilities; Nc) training



- 16 -
aids; (d) training abroad (about 340 man-months) and in China by foreign
experts (about 12 man-months) as well as scientific books and periodicals;
and (e) overseas visits by local staff for procurement. Requirements under
this component were identified and prepared by CFDC and reviewed by a
consultant from the International Fertilizer Development Center. The data
processing and computer needs have also been reviewed by consultants
(Haldor Topsoe) under the IDA-financed Technical Cooperation Credit
(1412-CHA).
3.   Technical Assistance to MCI Component
4.07      The Project will provide up to 30 man-months of consultancy
services for assistance in international procurement for the overall
Project to the project implementation coordination unit of MCI (para 5.04).
4.   Nitrogenous Fertilizer Production Cost Study
4.08      As stated in para 2.21 earlier, the Government's strategy in
nitrogenous fertilizer industry is to undertake programs to improve
efficiency of the existing plants through energy saving measures and
technical rehabilitation, especially of large- and medium-size plants.
Accordingly, comprehensive understanding on the cost structure of
fertilizer production is necessary to develop a basis for (a) evaluating
operational and energy efficiencies of nitrogen fertilizer production; and
(b) developing strategies for modernization of the fertilizer industry.
While adequate data is already available for the large-size nitrogen
plants, there is need to develop such data for medium-size plants for which
the potential for improvements in efficiency is substantial. Accordingly,
MCI will carry out a study on fertilizer production costs for a selected
sample of medium-size nitrogen plants (Annex 4-3). During negotiations
understandings were reached that (a) MCI would discuss the terms of
reference for the study and share the study's findings with the Bank; and
(b) the study would be completed within the next 18 months.
C.  Raw Materials and Utilities
4.09      The supply situation and arrangements for natural gas, anthracite
and pyrites for the plants under the Project are given in Annex 4-4.
Despite the increase in production (about 129,000 tons of urea and 5,000
tons of surplus ammonia for sale from the four gas-based fertilizer
complexes), the overall requirement of natural gas, including gas needed
for utilities, for the Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou and Liaohe complexes after
rehabilitation and energy saving modifications would decrease by about 30
million normal cubic meters (Nm') or by 1.7Z.  As noted in the previous
chapter, the shortages of natural gas for the Luzhou, Yunnan and Cangzhou
plants have, in the past, constrained plant operations. The potential for
expanded gas production in the Sichuan Province, which provides gas for the
Luzhou and Yunnan plants, is quite high. The Government expects to
gradually increase the Sichuan gas production from the present 5 billion
Nm3 to 7 and 10 billion Nm3 by 1990 and 2000, respectively. The Bank is
currently processing a proposed technical assistance loan for the
development of the Weiyuan gas field in the Sichuan basin with the
objective of developing a rehabilitation program to maximize the ultimate
recovery of gas reserves. Availability of natural gas for the Cangzhou



- 17 -
plant will be adequate (para 3.06). Natural gas supply to the Liaohe plant
is expected to remain satisfactory. Supply of natural gas in the future is
therefore expected to be adequatc for all plants to operate at full load
when the Project is completed.
4.10      Anthracite consumption for feedstock and fuel per ton of ammonia
at Nanjing will decrease by about 14Z because of higher efficiency of the
new processes under the Project. Pyrites consumption In the new sulfiric
acid plant will be about 3X less than the consumption in the existing
sulfuric acid lines. The present power and water supply systems and
arrangements at each plant location are adequate to meet the needs after
rehabilitation of the plants. Assurances were obtained that the Government
will provide or cause to be provided adequate and timely supply of
feedstock and raw materials to each of the companies to enable the
operation at optimal capacity of their fertilizer plants after
rehabilitation.
D.   Environmental Aspects
4.11      At Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou and Liaohe complexes, while liquid
effluents from the ammonia plants comply with environmental standards, the
waste waters from the urea plants contain about 0.05% ammonia and between
1.5% and 1.7% urea.   The high pressure hydrolizer units proposed under the
Project would reduce the maximum ammonia and urea contents in treated
liquid effluents from large plants to 5 milligram per liter (mg/1). At
Nanjing, where pollution level is determined by operations of NCIC's
several plants of different types, all liquid effluents from the nitrogen
fertilizer complex will be treated before discharge. In addition,
pollutants such as cyanogen will be removed in specific units through
appropriate physical-chemical treatments. The overall sulfur dioxide (SO2)
emission levels from the Nanjing nitrogen fertilizer complex at present
amount to 180 kilograms per hour (kg/h) while the maximum discharge
permitted by the local authorities is 190 kg/h for the whole complex.
Therefore, NCIC's sulfuric acid plant will be designed through installation
of a special ammonia scrubbing unit to discharge to the atmosphere only 50
parts per million (ppm) or about 10 kg/h of S02. Liquid effluents from the
ammonia scrubbing unit will be sent to a nearby small-size fertilizer plant
for conversion into ammonium sulphate, to be sold as fertilizer. Pyrite
cinders will be pelletized and used at the Nanjing Iron & Steel Works
factory located 5 km from NCIC. Liquid effluents from the wet scrubbing
unit of the roasting section of the existing sulfuric acid lines will be
eliminated by installing closed loops; the excess dilute sulfuric acid so
produced will be used in NCIC's phosphate fertilizer complex. The levels
of pollution before and after the Project for the five plants are shown in
Annex 4-5. Proposed measures to be undertaken under the Project to achieve
environmental levels compatible with international standards are
satisfactory. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the
companies will (a) build the facilities and operate the plants in
accordance with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank; and (b)
carry out and furnish to the Bank environmental safety case studies, in
accordance with the terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, for their
respective plants by December 31, 1985 for the Bank's review and comments.
The studies will identify major accident hazards that could arise from the



- 18 -
industrial activities, and indicate arrangements and controls in place to
prevent or limit consequences of major accidents that might occur.
V.   PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A.   Engineering Arrangements
5.01      The basic engineering and part of the detailed engineering is to
be provided by (a) MWK (US) for energy saving modifications in four large
ammonia plants at Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou and Liaohe--since the original
plant facilities were engineered and supplied by MWK, it has access to full
design and engineering details and MWK has also carried out such projects
successfully in similar plants elsewhere; (b) Snamprogetti (Italy)-a.major
urea process licensor with considerable experience in building hydrolysis
units, for providing these units in the four large urea plants; and (c) HG
(UK) for rehabilitation and energy saving measures in the medium-size
ammonia plant at Luzhou, originally engineered and supplied by them using
the ICI technology. For the medium-size urea plant at Luzhou, LNGCC has
received proposals for process and engineering from three competent
engineering firms--Toyo (Japan), Montedison (Italy) and UTI (US), and one
of them will be selected to provide the basic and part of the detailed
engineering. The services of international engineering firms in all cases
will include supervision of detailed engineering to be carried out by the
domestic design institutes and assistance in procurement, construction,
erection and start-up, with total project management assistance estimated
at about 330 man-months. Detailed engineering of the energy saving
modifications common to all the four large ammonia/urea plants will be
coordinated by MCI's project implementation coordination unit (para 5.04)
to minimize duplication of efforts by each plant, and will be undertaken by
the MCI's Design Institute No. 8 and the Chemical Industrial Engineering
Corporation in Beijing. The basic and detailed engineering for the
dehydrogenation unit at Liaohe will be carried out by the Chemical
Industrial Engineering Corporation in Beijing. The remaining detailed
engineering for items which are not common to all plants will be carried
out by the Chengdu Design Institute for the Luzhou and Yunnan plants, No. 6
Design Institute of Chemical Industry for the Cangzhou plant, and the
Chemical Industrial Engineering Corporation for the Liaohe plant. The
Chinese design institutes have experience in carrying out the needed
engineering work for the Project.
5.02      All basic and detailed design work for the nitrogen fertilizer
and sulfuric acid plants at Nanjing is being undertaken by the Nanjing
Design Institute except the design of the pyrites roaster and waste heat
boiler of the sulfuric acid plant which is to be carried out by Lurgi
(FRG). NCIC will also retain the services of Lurgi to review the design
and engineering for the whole sulfuric acid plant. The present water
scrubbing system in NCIC's ammonia plant to remove CO2 will be replaced by
a propylene carbonate scrubbing system based on technology satisfactorily
adopted in other ammonia plants in China.
5.03      Assurance has been obtained that the Government will employ
engineering firms and consultants with qualifications, experience and



- 19 -
terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to the Bank, to assist the
companies in carrying out their respective subcomponents.
B.   Project Management and Status
5.04      Project Organization.  MCI will have primary responsibility for
supervision of overall project iWmementation. In view of the complexity
of the Project involving several plants and institutions, MCI has
established a project implementation coordination unit within the Ministry
to ensure effective coordination of implementation of the overall Project.
It will continuously review progress including procurement and take timely
action to remove any constraints affecting project implementation.
Assurances were obtained that the Government will (a) maintain the unit
established within MCI to coordinate implementation of the Project, with
staff and responsibilities acceptable to the Banit; and (b) employ by
November 30, 1985, a procurement advisor for the MCI's project unit for
assistance in international procurement of equipment and material.
Implementation of tne individual subcomponents of the Project is the
responsibility of the five companies for their respective plant
rehabilitation and energy saving modifications, and CFDC for the fertilizer
research and development component. The civil works and erection of the
facilities will be planned and carried out in a manner so as to minimize -
production interruptions. Procurement of equipment and materials will be
coordinated by the MCI's project implementation coordination unit, and
handled by the companies and CFDC. International procurement will be
channelled through the China National Chemical Construction Company (CNCCC)
under MCI.
5.05      The management and staff of the MCI's project unit, five
companies and CFDC are competent and able to implement the Project
efficiently. The organization chart of the MCI's project implementation
coordination unit is given in Annex 5-1.
5.06      Project Status.  SPC approval of the Project was given in
October 1984. Proposals for the basic and part of the detailed engineering
and project management assistance ha'e been received from NWK for energy
saving modifications in the four large ammonia plants and Snamprogetti for
hydrolysis units in the four large urea plants. LNGCC expects to receive a
proposal for the basic and part of detailed engineering and project
management assistance for the medium-size ammonia plant from HG in May
1985. Proposals for process and engineering for the medium-size urea plant
at Luzhou from UTI, Montedison, and Toyo have been received, and are being
reviewed by LNGCC and MCI.
C.   Implementation Schedule
5.07      From the date of award for engineering contracts, the Luzhou,
Yunnan, Cangzhou and Liaohe subcomponents would take 30 months for
completion. The Nanjing subcomponent is expected to be completed by
December 1987.  While sufficient progress has already been made for
engineering arrangements, and some engineering contracts are expected to be
awarded before end June L985, it is conservatively assumed that all
engineering contracts will be signed by December 31, 1985. The fertilizer



- 20 -
research and development (CFDC) component is expected to be completed by
December 1987. The overall Project is expected to be completed by June 30,
1988. Project implementation schedule is given in Annex 5-2. The project
schedule, which is different from the standard profile of industrial
projects, is achievable consideriug that MCI has already made sufficient
progress toward engineering arrangements, most of the engineering firms
involved have experience of working in China, and the civil works and
erection involved are limited compared with a greenfield industrial
project.
D.   Training
5.08      The five companies have had previous experience in project
implementation and there is a nucleus of good and experienced engineers and
planners. Their technical skills in operating and maintaining the plants
and management skills are also good. The training program under the
Project aims at upgrading these skills by providing exposure to experience
outside China and in areas related to specialized technology and
machinery. Training programs for CFDC and its member research and design
institutes will provide for training of selected personnel abroad to build
and upgrade knowledge of recent advances in technology, and bringing some
foreign researchers to China for exchange of experience in selected
research areas and lectures on specialized topics. Assurances have been
obtained that (a) the five companies will develop their training programs
by September 30, 1985 for review with the Bank and implement them in
consultation with the Bank; and (b) the Government will cause CFDC to
develop its training programs by September 30, 1985 for review with the
Bank and implement them in consultation with the Bank.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A.   Project Capital Cost
6.01      The total project cost is estimated at US$173.8 million
equivalent including US$110.3 million equivalent or 63.5% of the total in
foreign exchange. The total financing required for the Project including
interest during construction (US$13 million) is estimated at US$186.8
million equivalent including US$122.7 million equivalent or 65.7% of the
total in foreign excbange. The capital cost estimates are detailed in
Annex 6-1 and summarized in the table on the following page.
6.02      The base cost estimates are in January 1985 prices and are based
on (a) the estimates of the project authorities and MCI following
information submitted by engineering firms; and (b) the Bank's own cost
information obtained from potential suppliers.  Phyz'cal contingencies are
calculated at 10% of the base cost estimate; no physical contingencies are
included for spare parts for the existing plant aid machinery for the
Luzhou and Yunnan plants, training and training aids, and for contracts
(US$2.5 million for the Nanjing plant) already effective. For base cost
and physical contingencies, the exchange rate of Y 2.80 = US$1.00
prevailing in January 1985 has been used. For the calculation of price

a/  Base cost and physical contingencies (in January 1985 prices) have been calculated using an
exchange rate of Yuan 2.80 - US$1.00 as of the estimating date. Project is exempt from
customs duties and taxes on imported equipment.

contingencies, it is assumed that exchange rate adjustments will, on
average, be made to maintain "purchasing power parity". On this basis,
price escalation for both foreign and local costs (a) when expressed in US
dollars, is based on expected international annual inflation rates of 5% in
1985, 7.5% in 1986 and 8% in 1987 and 1988; (b) when expressed in yuan, is
based on expected domestic inflation of 3Z p.a. in 1985-1988. While the
Project is exempt from import taxes and duties, the companies will pay
sales tax on locally procured equipment and material.

commitment charge of 0.75%. Of the total Bank loan of US$97.0 million
equivalent, the Government will (a) onlend US$87.0 million equivalent to
the five companies as follows: LNGCC (US$40.3 million), YNGCC (US$10.1
million), CCFC (US$11.1 million), LCFC (US$8.7 million) and NCIC (US$16.8
million), with an onlending rate of 8% p.a., a commitment charge of 0.75%,
and repayment over 10 years including 3 years of grace; and (b) make
available the balance of US$10 million equivalent to CFDC through MCI for
the fertilizer research and development component; under current Government
procedures, CFDC would repay the amDunt at an annual interest rate of 3.5%
and a commitment charge of 0.75% over 20 years including 5 years of grace.
The companies and CFDC will bear the foreign exchange risk. The onlending
to the companies will be under subsidiary loan agreements on terms and
conditions, including the above onlending terms, acceptable to the Bank. A
Project Agreement will be signed between the Bank and LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC,
LCFC and NCIC. Charters clarifying the legal status of the five companies
were approved and issued by MCI on September 15, 1984. There will be no
Project Agreement between the Bank and CFDC, since CFDC remains very much a
part of MCI. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and each of the five companies under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, and approval of the Loan Agreement by China's
State Council, will be conditions of loan effectiveness.
6.07      LNGCC and LCFC will finance US$17.0 million and US$5.8 million,
respectively, from domestic bank loans for 10 years including 3 years of
grace at an interest rate of 3.6% p.a. The remaining financing needs are
to be met from the companies' internal cash generation, except for LCFC for
which the Panjing Oil Company will also provide US$1.6 million for the
installation of a purge gas recovery unit at the Liaohe plant from which it
will buy recovered hydrogen. The companies are capable of meeting
financing requirements and their cash flow situation is expected to remain
sound (paras 7.06-7.08).

6.09      Procurement Arrangements for Bank Financing.  As noted earlier,
international procurement will be channelled through the China National
Chemical Construction Company (CNCCC) under MCI, and coordinated by the



- 25 -
project implementation coordination unit of MCI with assistance from the
international engineering firms as well as a procurement advisor to be
employed by November 30, 1985. Equipment and material, financed by the
Bank, will be procured in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines
through international competitive bidding (ICB) exceDt in cases where
limited international bidding (LIB), international shopping and direct
contracting are more appropriate. Under ICB, domestic manufacturers will
be eligible for a margin of preference of 15% or the prevailing customs
duty, whichever is lower, in bid comparison. Orders for equipment for
which there are only a limited number of suppliers may be procured through
LIB from a list of qualified and eligible suppliers to be agreed with the
Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$4.5 million equivalent. Orders for
small and miscellaneous items under contracts with an estimated value of up
to US$250,000 each may be procured through international shopping with
price quotations from at least three qualified and eligible suppliers up to
an aggregate amount of US$7 million equivalent. Equipment proprietary to
process design may be procured through direct contracting up to an
aggregate amount of US$4.5 million equivalent. Packages over US$500,000
each (estimated to total 30) will be subject to prior Bank review. Since
CNCCC has no prior experience in procurement following ICB procedures, the
first four ICB and two LIB packages regardless of their value will also be
subject to prior Bank review, to ensure better understanding on both sides
of the procurement process. Packages below US$500,000 each will be subject
to post review by the Bank. Consultants for technical services and
training financed by the Bank will be contracted in accordance with Bank
guidelines for use of consultants. For license, engineering and project
management services, MCI plans to use the technical services of selected
engineering firms with prior experience and which have been agreed with the
Bank (paras 5.01-5.02). Given the nature of assignments, the MCI's
approach for contracting with the original suppliers of engineering and
process technology for the plants included in the Project (M. W. Kellogg
(US) and Humphreys and Glasgow (UK)) is considered appropriate. Sufficient
progress has already been made for contracting of engineering services.
Contracts with the engineering firms will be subject to Bank approval prior
to signature. To proceed with the necessary preparatory work to avoid
delays in Project execution and start-up, the Bank loan will retroactively
finance up to US$500,000 of eligible expenditures for down payments to
engineering firms and for project management incurred between January 23,
1985 (date of end of post-appraisal mission) and the date of loan signing.
6.10      Procurement Arrangements for Chinese Financing.  Supply of local
construction materials, plant and equipment is regulated by an allocation
system administered by central and provincial government agencies, and
applications for annual requirements have to be made to SPC and the State
Material Supply Bureau in advance. However, in line with the recently
introduced policy of economic responsibility, the buyers and suppliers of
equipment have been given a certain leeway for negotiations as to type of
equipment, deliveries and price. Most of the detailed engineering, some
equipment, civil works and erection contracts will be procured locally and
financed by the beneficiary companies. Contracts for civil works and
erection will be through assignment to specialized construction bureaus or
companies, under negotiated contracts specifying the unit costs, terms of
payments, and incerntives and penalties for early/late completion. The
capacity and capabilities of the local contractors proposed for the Project
are satisfactory for timely and efficient completion of proposed works,



- 26 -
which in the case of rehabilitation work and energy saving modifications
under the Project are relatively limited.

authorized allocation of US$4 million. Disbursements will be against full
documentation except for training, overseas visits by local staff for
engineering and procurement, and contracts valued less than US$100,000
equivalent each, which would be against statements of expenditure.
Documents in support of statements of expenditure will be retained by the
MCI's project implementation coordination unit and made available tce he
Bank for review during the Project supervision. An estimated disbursement

schedule for the Project along with disbursement profiles of industrial
projects completed (i) in the Region; and (ii) Bank-wide is given in Annex
6-2. The expected disbursement of the proposed Bank loan is faster than
the standard profile of industrial projects as (a) the proposed Project
would rehabilitate existing facilities; (b) civil works and erection
involved are limited; and (c) the project implementation period is
considerably shorter than for a greenfield industrial project. The loan
closing date will be June 30, 1989.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Background on Financial Management Practices
7.01      The LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC, LCFC and NCIC are governed by the
financial regulations issued by MOF to all state-owned industrial
enterprises in China. While the companies are self-accounting entities,
they have been constrained in the past in financial autonomy (para 3.02).
7.02      The Chinese accounting system has the following special features:
(a) two separate accounts are maintained--one for production and the other
for capital construction, and which are not consolidated; (b) interest
charges are included in production costs and as a result the income
statements combine the effect of financial structure with the results of
operations; and (c) funds are identified for specific purposes-fixed
assets from fixed funds, circulating (current) assets from circulating
funds and special assets from special funds. Generally, these three
earmarked funds are not fungible and assets and liabilities in each
category should match. However, the principle of non-fungibility,
especially between the circulating and special funds is currently being
relaxed.
7.03      The Government has recently begun to introduce changes in
financial regulations as part of the on-going economic reforms which would
allow more autonomy to individual enterprises mainly to encourage greater
operational and financial efficiency. Major changes have been introduced
to encourage the economic use of funds. In the past, new investments were
provided as grants through budget allocations, and enterprises were
required to remit back most of realized profits and depreciation allowances
to the Government. With the recent policy changes: (a) state budget funds
for major ("capi:al construction-) investments will be provided as
long-term loans instead of grants; (b) enterprises will be allowed to
retain an increased portion of the annual depreciation allowance (70Z in
place of 50% earlier); and (c) enterprises are now allowed to retain a
variable portion (amounting in practice to 15%) of profits. As planning
has so far been limited to setting both physical and financial targets for
one year only, there is a need to extend its horizon and to change
financial management practices.
7.04      Until recently, financial statements of Chinese enterprises were
not subject to comprehensive audit. As an instrument of safeguarding



- 28 -
public investments and encouraging efficiency in public administration, the
State Audit Administration (SAA), which has the status of a ministry, was
established in 1983. SAA has established a new Foreign Investment Auditing
Bureau, with responsibility for audits of projects financed by the World
Bank and other foreign sources and joint venture operations. The Bank is
supporting the Government's efforts for establishing a strong national
audit capability through training under the Technical Cooperation Credit
(1412-CHA).
B.   Past Financial Performance and Financial Projections
7.05      Financial analyses of the project entities including financial
projections have been carried out in current yuan. Key assumptions used in
the financial analysis are given in Annex 7-1. In order to provide an
overall view of the companies' financial performance and position, the
following adjustments have been made: (a) consolidation of the two sets of
financial statements for production and capital construction; (b)
reclassification of accounts in income statements and balance sheets as
necessary according to the conventional accounting concepts; and (c)
preparation of the sources and applications of funds statements. For NCIC,
two sets of data are analyzed: (i) for the nitrogen fertilizer plant; and
(ii) for the Company as a whole. Detailed historical financial data and
financial projections are given in Annexes 7-2 to 7-7. Salient features
highlighting historical operating results as well as of financial
projections of the companies are summarized in the table on the following
page.
7.06      Past Financial Performance.  The present financial performance
and position of the companies are sound, This reflects the past government
policies regarding the financial management of industrial enterprises,
i.e., the provision of investment and working capital as grant allocations
from the budget and administered prices of inputs and outputs. Except for
CCFC which has operated substantially below capacity in recent years due to
the shortage of natural gas (para 3.06), the companies' return on net
assets in service (both fixed and working capital) has remained
satisfactory (between 16% and 30% in 1984 for fertilizer operations).
Fixed assets have been valued at historical cost less depreciation. Given
China's low level of inflation over the last 30 years (averaging about
I%-2Z), revaluation of net fixed assets would hardly change the analysis
significantly. The current ratio of four out of the five companies in 1984
was over 10.8, and for NCIC, it was 4.6. Long-term debt is almost
non-existent reflecting the past financing arrangements.
7.07      Financial Projections.  In evaluating the ProJect, the capacity
utilization and production levels after the Project for each of the five
companies take into account raw materials supply, expansion of capacity and
improved operational reliability through technical renovation under the
Project (Anaex 7-1, Table 1 ). For revenue and operating cost projections,
it is assumed that ex-factory output prices as well as input costs will
remain at their January 1985 levels in real terms. Their current prices
are therefore projected to increase from their January 1985 levels in line
with the projected domestic inflation of 3% p.a. It is, however, possible
that as part of the on-going economic reforms in China, there could be
changes in the existing price structure. Since the current domestic

relative prices of nitrogen fertilizers and energy inputs are in line with
their relative economic prices, it is assumed that the existing relative
price relationship between fertilizer and energy inputs will be maintained
(paras 2.14 and 7.10).
7.08      The financial situation of the five companies is expected to
remain satisfactory throughout the project life. All major financial
parameters are expected to improve further after the Project as production
builds up and operating costs are reduced due to greater operational
efficiency and energy saving. Total net profits of LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC,
LCFC and NCIC's nitrogen fertilizer plant (after a decrease in 1985 from
their 1984 levels due to a rise in product tax rates in late 19841/), are
expected to increase from Y 125 million in 1985 to Y 231 million in 1989
and Y 268 million in 1991. In the future, recent changes in the Government
policy allowing higher retention of internally generated funds by
enterprises are expected to result in significantly improved financial
viability of the companies. The companies are expected to generate from
the first year after rehabilitation and energy saving modifications,
sufficient cash to more than meet their debt service requirements.
Besides, the companies are allowed to deduct repayment of long-term loans
from taxable income so that they can service their debt prior to tax
payments. The key financial ratios (profitability, current, debt/equity
and debt service coverage ratios) are expected to remain at satisfactory
levels through the project life.
C.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.09      The cost and benefit streams for the incremental financial rates
of return, expressed in real 1985 yuan, are shown in Annex 7-8. Estimated
base case financial rates of returns (before taxes) for the companies vary
between 12.6% (CCFC) and 31.4% (YNGCC). Results of sensitivity tests,
summarized in the table on the following page, indicate that the financial
rates of return will remain satisfactory under any reasonable change in the
main parameters. The fintncial rates of return for the Project are more
sensitive to changes in product prices and capital costs and, to a lesser
extent, to changes in input prices. The financial rates of return are
1/   Product tax rates are levied on industrial enterprises based on
production levels and are collected out of their sales revenues. They
were increased from 3X for fertilizers and 10% for industrial
chemicals to 20% for both products from natural gas-based plants, and
from 3% to 5% for fertilizers from coal-based plants. Changes in
product tax rates will not, however, affect companies' other financIal
parameters because adjustment income tax rates were also
simultaneous'ly reduced.

lower than the economic rates of return because the market prices of energy
inputs, which represent a major source of benefits (energy saving) of the
Project, are lower than their economic values. An 18-month delay in
project implementation would reduce the companies' returns by about 2.9 to
9.0 percentage points. However, the likelihood of this occurring is low
especially because of the involvement of experienced engineering firms and
satisfactory project implementation arrangements.
D. Financial Covenants
7.10       During negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government
that it shall continue to take, or cause to be taken, all measures which,
under conditions of efficient plant operation, would enable each of the
companies to at least meet all operating expenses from revenues from all
sources, and service its debt from internal cash retention. It would imply
that if energy input prices for fertilizer production were to increase,
ex-factory fertilizer prices would be accordingly adjusted. Meaning of
efficient plant operation is given in Annex 7-9. The term "all operating
expenses' is defined as all expenses related to the company's operations
which include raw materials, utilities and labor for production,
maintenance, depreciation, insurance fees, administration and sales
expenses, product tax, interest and other charges on debt and other cash
expenditures directly charged against revenues such as pensions. The term
"debt- means both long-term and short-term debt. The term "internal cash
retention' means gross revenues from all sources less all operating



- 32 -
expenses, taxes and public charges but before interest and other charges a-.
debt, repayment of loans, plus retained portion of depreciation.
7.11      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the companies
that they will (a) take all measures which, under conditions ot efficient
plant operation, would enable them to at least meet all operating expenses
from revenues from all sources, and service their debt from internal cash
retention; and (b) not incur any long-term debt unless a reasonable
forecast of their revenues and expenditures shows that their projected
internal cash retention for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to
be incurred shall exceed 1.2 times their projected debt service
requirements in such year on all its debt including the debt to be
incurred. For this purpose, the term 'debt service requirement" means the
aggregate amount of amortization of long-term debt and interest and other
charges on both long- and short-term debts; and (c) prepa:e and furnish to
the Bank by October 31 of each year, starting in 1985 and up to 1990, for
exchange of views with the Bank, their production, investment and financial
plans in a form of projected financial statements, for the next five
years. Such plans shall also include details on: (i) trend of production
costs; (ii) preliminary statements for the current fiscal year including
budget variance analysis; (iii) annual plans for the following year
including operational and financial targets, criteria for performance
evaluation and measures they propose to take during the next year to meet
the annual targets; and (iv) updated financing arrangements for the
investment plan for the next five years. In the case of NCIC, the covenant
related to the rolling five year plans will apply only to its nitrogen
fertilizer plant. During negotiations understandings were reached that (a)
the criteria for performance evaluation will include capacity utilization,
specific energy consumption and normally accepted prudent financial
parameters including a reasonable return on net assets employed, current
ratio and long-term debt to equity ratio; and (b) the companies will
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.4 and a long-term debt to equity
ratio of 60:40 or better.
E. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.12      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (a) the
companies will have their annual financial stateme-:s and project accounts
including withdrawals from the special account audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank in accordance with appropriate accounting
principles consistently applied, and submitted with the audit report to the
Bank within six months after the close of each fiscal year. The companies
would provide their financial statements for both LApital construction and
production accounts to the Bank in order to provide an overall view of
their financial performance and position; financial statements of NCIC will
be provided for both the nitrogen fertilizer plant and the Company as a
whole. The five companies will also provide to the Bank their quarterly
project progress and procurement status reports and financial statements
within one month after the end of each quarter; (b) the Government will
cause CFDC to have its project accounts including withdrawals from the
special account audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
submitted with the audit report to the Bank within six months after the end
of each fiscal year. CFDC will also submit to the Bank its quarterly
project progress and procurement status reports within one month after the



- 33 -
end of each quarter; and (c) the audit reports for the companies and CFDC
will contain a separate opinion regarding loan withdrawals on the basis of
statements of expenditure. The director of SAA's Foreign Investment
Auditing Bureau anticipates no difficulty in complying with this schedule.
Within six months after the closing date for the Project, the five
companies and CFDC will prepare and provide to the Bank a completion report
for their respective components of the Project dealing with project
implementation, initial operation, and the costs and benefits derived and
expected to be derived therefrom.
F. Risks
7.13      Technical risks are moderate as the Project deals with existing
plants and commercially proven technology. However, the risk of
commissioning problems, and of not attaining and maintaining a high
operating rate especially for the medium-size plant at Luzhou cannor be
ruled out. This risk is minimized by the involvement of experienced
international engineering firms in the design, engineering and
comuissioning of the plants, and by the provision of training in operations
and maintenance. The main risks are delays in procurement and
implementation, due to the complex nature of the Project involving a number
of components and institutions, and no prior experience within CNCCC ini
international procurement following ICB procedures. These risks should,
however, be minimized through the provision of specialists to strengthen
the operational staff where necessary, involvement of experienced
engineering firms, maintenance of the project implementation coordination
unit in MCI, and the planned substantial effort on the part of the Bank
staff in project monitoring and supervision. No commercial risk is
foreseen. The risk of Inadequate financial performance of the companies
mainly due to adverse changes in relative prices of inputs and outputs and
in taxes should be minimized through the financial covenants.
VIII. ECONOMC ANALYSIS
A.   Introduction
8.01      The economic analysis was carried out for the plant
rehabilitation and energy saving component only since benefits of the
fertilizer research and development (CFDC) component are not quantifiable.
Except for the Nanjing sulfuric acid plant which is considered a new plant,
the economic analysis for all plants was carried out on an incremental
basis, taking into account the investments under the Project, incremental
benefits and incremental operating costs after rehabilitation. In addition
to incremental returns, economic viability of the entire facilities at each
location was also analyzed to establish justification for energy saving
modifications and rehabilitation of the existing facilities (para 8.08).



- 34 -
B.   Economic Costs and Benefits
8.02      The assumptions used in the economic analysis of the Project are
described in Annex 8-1. The costs and benefits are expressed in January
1985 terms. In summary, all ecornomic costs and benefits for internationally
tradeable items are valued at international prices estimated to prevail
during the economic life of the Project. All non-tradeable items are valued
at their respective domestic prices, excluding local taxes, after applying
specific conversion factors given in Annex 8-1 to reflect the economic
prices to China.
8.03      The economic benefits of the Project mainly come from (a) the
increase in production volume (over and above what could be realized by the
adequate availability of raw materials) through rehabilitation, capacity
expansion, and improvtements in operational reliability of the plants; and
(b) the decrease in the specific energy consumption and other operating
costs. Main benefits of the four fertilizer complexes (large ammonia/urea
plants) of LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC and LCFC are very similar and comprise small
increase in ammonia production, greater recovery of urea, energy savings,
and decrease in other operating costs. In the case of YNGCC's plant,
benefits also come from an increase in ammonium nitrate production from
surplus ammonia after meeting requirements for urea production. Economic
benefits of the old, medium-size ammonia/urea plant at Luzhou come from (a)
higher production from plant revamping, improved operational performance,
and expansion of capacity by 50%; (b) energy savings; and (c) decrease in
other operating costs. In the case of NCIC, main economic benefits of the
medium-size nitrogen fertilizer plant comprise (i) higher ammonia
production from plant revamping, improved operational performance, and
expansion of capacity to 150,000 tons or by more than 25%; (ii) higher
production of ammonium nitrate and methanol; (iii) energy savings; and (!v)
decrease in other operating costs. NCIC's new sulfuric acid plant will
replace 180,000 tons of sulfuric acid.
8.04      For calculating economic benefits, the future price of bulk urea
is assumed to increase from the January 1985 level of US$171/ton FOB West
Europe to US$235/ton in 1990, and US$245/ton in 1995 (all in January 1985
US$).2/ These prices reflect expected future increases in energy costs as
well as a more balanced world demand and supply situation for urea ir the
1990s. The economic ex-factory prices for each plant were arrived at by
adding sea freight to China, unloading, port handling, bagging charges and
inland freight from ports to the plant sites. The international price of
ammonia is assumed to be the same as the FOB price of bulk urea. The price
of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (AN) is derived from the urea price
after adjustments for their nutrienit values and the economic price of
2/   The current price level (FOB West Europe) of US$171/ton for bulk urea
(or US$186/ton for bagged urea) reflects a low international rrice
resulting from a temporary oversupply situation due to the recent
worldwide recession and hence low demand and excessive stocks. The
present low level of urea price is expected to improve with gradual
reductior. in available surplus of nitrogen fertilizer in the world
market and reach long-term equilibrium level by about 1990.



- 35 -
industrial grade AN is assumed to be 30% higher than the fertilizer grade
AN price, in line with their relative prices in the international market.
The economic price of sulfuric acid, based on the alternative cost of local
production, using imported sulfur has been calculated at US$66/ton in 1985,
US$68/ton in 1990, and US$73/ton in 1995.
8.05      The economic price of natural gas is based on the equivalent
netback value to China from fuel oil exports after adjusting f or their
relative calorific values, since China currently exports fuel oil. On this
basis, the economic price of natural gas, at the Luzhou plant site, is
calculated at US$101 per thousand Nm3 in 1985, US$100 in 1990, and US$151
in 1995. Economic prices for natural gas for other plants are given in
Annex 8-1. The economic price of anthracite for the Nanjing nitrogen
plant, based on the latest price projections by the Bank's Commodity
Studies and Projections Division and on its netback to China from exports,
is calculated at US$40.6/ton in 1985, US$36.6/ton in 1990, and US$39.6/ton
in 1995. Pyrite concentrate for the Nanjing sulfuric acid plant is a
byproduct of the Yungping copper mine in the Jiangxi Province. Although
pyrite concentrate is not actively traded in the international market, its
economic price is conservatively based on netback to China from possible
exports, and is calculated at US$8.2/ton in 1985, US$9.2/ton in 1990 and
US$10.2/ton in 1995.
C.   Economic Rate of Return
8.06      The base case economic rates of return in constant terms are 45%
and 28% for the medium- and large-size plants, respectively, at Luzhou, 39%
for Yunnan, 27% for Cangzhou, 27% for Liaohe, 182 for the nitrogen plant at
Nanjing and 29% for the Nanjing sulfuric acid unit. The weighted average
economic rate of return for the plant rehabilitation and energy saving
component as a whole is 31%. This reflects the high economic benefits
possible (i.e., the increase in production volume and the decrease in
specific energy consumption and other operating costs) from rehabilitation
and energy saving modifications in existing capacity. The economic cash
flows for these calculations are given in Annex 8-2. The results of
sensitivity analyses are summarized in the table on the following page. To
further analyze the importance of critical variables on the economic
viability of the Project, the switching or cross-over values3/ of
important variables have also been calculated using a 10% discount rate and
are shown in the same table.
3/   The switching value of a variable is that value at which the net
present value of the project becomes zero at a given discount rate.

8.07      Results of sensitivity tests indicate that the Project would
remain economically viable under any reasonable change in the main
parameters. The economic rates of return for the plant rehabilitation and
energy saving component are relatively more sensitive to changes in sales
benefits (i.e., output prices), and to a lesser extent to changes in
capital and variable costs (i.e., input prices). This is because
rehabilitation and energy saving projects are less exposed to project risks
than grass-root projects. Even with a delay of 18-months and increase in
capital costs by 20%, the weighted average economic rate of return would
still be 20%.   The analysis of the switching values also shows that even
under conceivable adverse conditions, the Project would remain economically
viable. Increases in capital costs ranging from 58% to 3342 for the
individual plants, which will make the net present value at a 10% discount
rate zero, are very unlikely. Similarly, an increase in variable costs
ranging from 47% to 254% for the Nanjing and Luzhou medium-size plants4/
4/   The Nanjing and Luzhou medium-size nitrogen plants involve capacity
expansions, while the Nanjing sulfuric acid plant is new.



- 37 -
and a decrease in variable costs ranging from 832 to 100% for the Yunnan,
Cangzhou, Liaohe and Luzhou large plants5/ are considered unlikely. The
most critical variable is clearly the sales benefits-a decrease of more
than 20% and 42% for the Nanjing nitrogen and sulfuric acid plants
respectively will, other things remaining as expected, make the net present
value at a discount rate of 10% negative.  For the Project as a whole, a
decrease of more than 63% will, other things remaining as expected, make
the net present value negative. However, the risk of lower sales benefits
due to lower economic prices of products at such a magnitude is not
considered significant, and the risk of lower plant operating rates is
minimized by the involvement of experienced engineering firms in project
implementation and training of personnel for operation and maintenance.
8.08      In considering the basic justification for energy saving
modifications and rehabilitation of the existing facilities, it is
important to analyze, in addition to the incremental returns, the economic
viability of the facilities after rehabilitation. Therefore, the economic
analysis for the entire facilities at each location, after the proposed
Project, has been attempted, treating past investments in the plants as
sunk costs but taking their economic salvage values into account. Salvage
values of the plants at Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou, Liaohe and Nanjing
(nitrogen plant only) are estimated at US$40 million, US$29 million, US$25
million, US$25 million and US$15 million, respectively, in January 1985
prices. The economic analysis shows that all plants under the Project are
economically viable with positive net economic cash flows in each year of
the plants' operating life.
D.   Sectoral Contributions and Other Benefits
8.09      The Project meets China's objectives in the industrial
sector--modernization of existing industrial facilities, technology
upgrading and energy conservation, institutional improvements and
training. The technical renovation and energy efficiency related
investments under the Project are likely to be followed by similar
investments in other fertilizer plants as well as other energy intensive
industries in the country. The Project is important to the Government's
efforts to prepare industrial enterprises for efficient operations under
the reformed economic structure by improving their energy efficiency and
minimizing production costs.  The Project will also imprv#e companies'
capabilities in plant operations and financial management. The outcome of
the fertilizer production cost study will help provide a basis for
formulating strategies to modernize medium-size nitrogen fertilizer
plants. While the economic benefits of the fertilizer research and
development component are not quantifiable, they are expected to be
substantial for the development of the Chinese fertilizer industry.
8.10      The Project will generate significant benefits to China.  In
1991, when stabilized production levels are reached, the Project will (a)
result in significant savings in energy consumption with decreases of
6% to 14% for feedstock and fuel and decreases of 4% to 20% for electricity
5/   The Yunnan, Cangzhou, Liaohe and Luzhou large plants involve energy
saving modifications, in addition to greater recovery of urea from
liquid effluents.

per ton of ammonia; (b) increase production of urea, ammonium nitrate,
methanol, and surplus ammonia for sale by 129,000 tons, 24,000 tons, 29,000
tons, and 14,000 tons, respectively; (c) replace production of 180,000 tpy
of sulfuric acid; and (d) generate a net foreign exchange saving over the
economic life of the Project, after foreign debt service, of about US$694
million in January 1985 US dollars. The local engineering firms and some
of CFDC's design institutes involved in project implementation will gain
valuable know-how and experience in designing technical renovation and
energy saving programs.  The unquantifiable economic benefits of training
as well as technical assistance add to the attractiveness of the Project.

CHINA - FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
1.        Types of Fertilizer Products.  Domestic fertilizer production in
China is characterized by a small number of product types and low average
nutrient content. Nitrogen production is about 58% armonium bicarbonate
(17.5% N), 30% urea (46Z N) and the balance is largely ammonium nitrate
(AN) (34%-35% N) and aqueous ammonia (12Z-16Z N). About 72% of phosphate
production is single superphosphate (14%-18% P205), and 27% is
calcium-magnesium phosphate (about 15X P205).  Ammonium bicarbonate, the
main product from small nitrogen plants, is prone to evaporation during and
after application and difficult to transport and store for a prolonged
period without substantial losses. Efforts to reduce nutrient losses
through improved packaging, reducing moisture content and improved
application methods, have so far been only partially successful. Because
of these concerns and the high energy consumption (para 4), about 300
small-size nitrogen plants have been closed recently and no such new plants
are to be built in the future.
2.        Feedstock for Nitrogenous Fertilizers.  China uses a variety of
feedstocks for fertilizer production. In 1983, coal accounted for 65% of
ammonia production, natural gas for 23%, and fuel oil and naphtha for 12%.
Fertilizer production consumes about 30% of China's gas production.
Although there are no firm plans at present for any new green-field
nitrogenous fertilizer plants, such capacity is being considered based on
recent gas discoveries. The recent offshore gas discovery south of Hainan
Island in the South China Sea by ARCO (US) is of significant magnitude, and
could result in gas production of about 6 billion cubic meters or
equivalent to about 5 million tons of oil per year. Foreign companies are
currently discussing with GOC the possibility of developing a very large
nitrogen fertilizer complex on Hainan Island for both domestic use and
possibly for exports. Establishment of a large fertilizer complex and
other potential uses to exploit the newly discovered gas will, however,
require large infrastructure and huge investments, and need to be carefully
evaluated. China needs to take steps to expioit this potential wnich
would, inter alia, involve the development of the gas fields, putting in
gathering systems, establishing gas infrastructure and taking such measures
as are necessary for identifying potential demand and building the
necessary absorptive capacity for gas. The Bank is reviewing this aspect
with the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. The China National Offshore Oil
Company is carrying out a study for utilization of gas from the South China
Sea.
3.        Plant Capacity and Technologies.  A wide range of plant
capacities and ammonia technologies have been used in China. This
evolution reflects mainly the technologies available at the time of plant
construction and GOC's decision during the early phases of the industry to
rely on indigenous technology to the extent possible. It was only in the
early 1970s when GOC decided to build large-scale nitrogen fertilizer
plants using imported technology and equipment. Production processes



- 43 -
ANNEX 2-2
Page 2 of 2
include coal gasification, partial oxidation of fuel oil and steam
reforming of natural gas and naphtha. The average capacity utilization of
the 13 large imported ammonia/urea plants in 1983 was 81Z with the
following breakdown: 4 plants operated at 91Z-97Z, 4 plants at 81Z-88Z, 4
plants at 722-77X and one plant at 52%. The low capacity utilization
(below 80%) of some large plants is mainly du' to constraints in feedstock
supplies (natural gas and naphtha).  The operation of the indigenously
built large nitrogen plant has suffered due to technical problems. The
main production constraint to the small- and medium-size nitrogen
fertilizer plants has been the varied quality and reliability of coal
supplies.
4.        Energy Consumption.  Generally energy consumption in China's
nitrogenous fertilizer plants is higher than attainable levels as shown in
the table below:

CHINA - FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
A.   Luzhou Natural Gas Chemical Company (LNGCC)
1.        LNGCC, established in 1960, has two ammonia/urea plants, located
at Luzhou in the Sichuan Province in the southwestern part of China. The
medium-size ammonia/urea plant, commissioned in 1966 (the old plant),
includes an ammonia plant (300 tpd capacity) designed by Humphreys &
Glasgow of the UK (HG) based on the ICI process, and an urea plant (500 tpd
capacity) designed by Kellogg Continental (Netherlands) (KCN), based on the
Stamicarbon conventional total recycle process. In 1977, LNGCC
coumissioned a large ammonia/urea plant which includes a 1,000 tpd M. W.
Kellogg (US) (MWI) ammonia plant and a 1,620 tpd Stamicarbon CO2 stripping
process urea plant designed by KCN.
2.        LNGCC was registered with the Sichuan Provincial government in
September 1981 as a state enterprise and Independent accounting entity.
Responsibility for day-to-day Company operations and management are vested
in the General Manager appointed by the Sichuan Provincial government. He
is assisted by: (a) four deputy general managers responsible for
production, maintenance, personnel, sales and procurement, respectively;
(b) a chief engineer; and (c) a chief accountant. LNGCC currently has
4,011 employees, of which 321 or 8Z are technical staff and 152 or 3.8Z are
managerial personnel. MDst of the technical staff have received college or
university education and about 1,170 persons or 29% of the total staff have
received technical training beyond the secondary school level.
3.        The recent trend of production and capacity utilization of the
Company's production facilities is summarized below:

4.        Since its start-up in 1977, the large, new ammonia/urea plant has
operated satisfactorily at about 90% capacity utilization. There is,
however, significant scope for reducing energy consumption for ammonia
production by about 8%. It is also necessary to treat the condensates from
the evaporation system of the urea plant, which contain about 1.7% urea and
are presently discharged into the Yangtze river. The Project will include
energy saving modifications in the ammonia plant and a hydrolysis unit as
well as a low pressure absorption system in the urea plant to reduce
pollution and to recover 8,000 tpy urea. The medium-size, old ammonia/urea
plant has been in operation for nearly 20 years and as a result can benefit
from rehabilitation measures since (a) corrosion and wear on many
components have reached advanced levels; (b) breakdowns are frequent; and
(c) spare parts are not easily available and maintenance costs are high.
Some plant sections (syn-gas compressor station, high pressure synthesis
loop, C02 recovery system from flue gas, etc.) need urgent rehabilitation.
Furthermore, as the old plant is based on technology of the early 1960s,
the energy consumption per ton of ammonia and steam consumption in the urea
plant are high. Because of the technical problems and shortage of natural
gas, the old ammonia plant has been able to operate only at about 80%
capacity during the last four years except in 1982 when capacity
utilization was about 50% due to technical problems in the syngas
compressors.  The rehabilitation of the old plant under the Project will
overcome technical bottlenecks as well as increase its capacity by 50%. At
the same time, energy saving from modifications in both the old and new
plants under the Project will make available gas savings that would permit
50% capacity expansion of the old plant while maintaining overall natural
gas consumption substantially at present levels. Adequate natural gas from
the Sichuan gas network is expected to be available for the Luzhou plant
(Annex 4-4).
B.   Yunnan Natural Gas Chemical Company (YNGCC)
5.         YNGCC was established in May 1974 to produce nitrogen
fertilizers. Its fertilizer complex, located in Shuifu county, Yunnan
Province in the southwestern part of China, has four plants: ammonia
(1,000 tpd capacity), urea (1,620 tpd), nitric acid (240 tpd) and ammonium
nitrate (333 tpd). The Kellogg ammonia and Stamicarbon C02 stripping
process urea plants, commissioned in 1978, were designed by MWK and KCN,
respectively. The nitric acid and ammonium nitrate units, based on China's
own technology and equipment, were started in 1981.
6.        Since 1978, YNGCC has been registered in the Yunnan Province as a
state enterprise and independent accounting entity. Responsibility for
day-to-day Company operations and management is vested in the General
Manager appointed by the Yunnan Provincial government. He is assisted by
(a) three deputy general managers responsible for production and equipment,
personnel and management, and capital construction and technology,
respectively; (b) two assistant chief engineers; and (c) a chief
accountant. YNGCC at present has 2,343 employees, of which 556 or 24% are
technical and administrative staff. About 10% of the total staff have
received higher education beyond the college level. YNGCC operates a
training center for its staff.

a, Plant is oversized and production is limited by ammonia availability.
8.        While the fertilizer production facilities are well operated and
maintained, ammonia production has remained at about 8OZ of capacity in
recent years due to interruptions in natural gas supply from the Sichuan
gas network. At present, the Sichuan gas network cuts off gas supply to
the Yunnan complex for to-' "inths in a year, including one month for
planned annual maintenance. After the Project, even if natural gas
availability remains at present levels, which is unlikely (Annex 4-4),
capacity utilization would increase to 891 as energy savings would release
additional gas for increased production. Ammonium nitrate production will
also slightly increase by about 9,000 tons as more surplus ammonia will be
available, with capacity utilization still remaining low due to
substantially oversized plant capacity and limited surplus ammonia
available after meeting urea production requirements.
C.  Cangzhou Chemical Fertilizer Company (CCFC)
9.        CCFC, established in October 1973, has its ammonia/urea plan-
located at Cangzhou, Hebei Province in the northeastern part of China. The
plant was commissioned in 1978 with MWK and KCN as engineering contractors
for the Rellogg (US) ammonia plant (1,000 tpd) and the Stamicarbon CO2
stripping process urea plant (1,620 tpd), respectively.    -
10.        CCFC Y.aS registered in 1982 with the Hebei Provincial government
as an independent accounting and state-owned enterprise. Executive
management of the Company is vested in the General Manager, appointed by
the Hebei Provincial government. Re is responsible for day-to-day
operations of the Company. He is assisted by (a) three deputy general
managers for production, procurement and marketing, and technology; (b) a
chief engineer for technology development and scientific research; and (c)
a chief accountant. However, the division of responsibility among the

second level managers, particularly between the deputy general manager for
technology development and chief engineer, is not very clear. While the
deputy general manager for technology is responsible for resolving
technical problems arising from day-to-day plant operations, the chie'
engineer handleL rather long-term aspects of technology development. The
Company is, therefore, in the process of restructuring its organization.
CCFC at present has 2,003 employees, of which 619 or 31% are technical and
administrative staff. About 262 persons or 13% of the total staff have
received higher education beyond the college level.

12.       CCFC's operations have been affected in recent years mainly by -
the shortage of natural gas due to declining production from the Dagang oil
field. A gas pipeline scheduled for completion by end-1985 (Annex 4-4),
will provide the Cangzhou plant adequate gas from the Zhongyuan oil fields
(Henan Province) to supplement gas available from the Dagang oilfields to
operate the facilities at about 86X of the capacity. The plant, however,
consumes much more energy than necessary and this will be oDrrected by the
Project. With energy saving modifications under the Project, the capacity
utilization will further rise to 89%.
D.   Liaohe Chemical Fertilizer Company (LCFC)
13.       LCFC was founded in May 1974 to produce ammonia/urea based on
natural gas from the nearby Panjing oil fie.ad close to Yingkou. The
fertilizer complex, located at Liaohe in Panshan county, Liaoning Province
in the northeast of China, started production in December 1976. The
Kellogg (US) ammonia plant (1,000 tpd) and the Stamicarbon C02 stripping
process urea plant (1,620 tpd) were engineered by MWK and KCN,
respectively. LCFC also owns a catalyst unit with a capacity of 3,300 tpy.
14.       LCFC was registered with the Liaoning Privincial government in
1979 as a state-owned industrial enterprise and an independent accounting
entity. LCFC is headed by a General Manager responsible for day-to-day
operations of the Company. He is appointed by the Liaoning Provincial
government. There are (a) four deputy general managers responsible for
production, equipment, sales and procurement, and administration; (b) a
chief engineer responsible for technical matters including revamping of the

plant; and {c) a chief accountant. The chief engineer is assisted by three
deputy chief engineers. CCFC has some 2,875 employees of which 446 or
15.5% have received higher education beyond college level.
15.       The recent tr nd of production and capacity utilization of LCFC's
production facilities is summarized below:

16.       The Liaohe plant is well operated and maintained.  The capacity
utilization has been maintained at high levels except in 1982, when it was
only 70% due to interruptions in water supply from the Liaokou river. To
overcome the water supply problem, LCFC constructed a 52 km water pipeline
from the Dalin river. Availability of gas from the Panjing oil field for
the Liaohe plant is expected to remain adequate throughout the project life
to operate the facilities at full load.
E.   Nanjing Chemical Industry Company (NCIC)
17.       NCIC, located in Da Cheng Zhen, a district on the north bank of
Yangtze river in the Jiangsu Province, mid-eastern part of China, is a
large chemical company with diverse activities (para 3.08). NCIC consists
of 13 subsidiary plants/units with revenue generating units as independent
profit centers.
18.       NCIC was registered in the Jiangsu Province in 1953 as a state
industrial enterprise, with autonomous operations. The Company functions
as an independent accounting entity. Executive management of the Company
is vested in the General Manager, appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial
government at the recommendation of MCI. He is responsible for day-to-day
operations of the Company. The General Manager is assisted by (a) four
deputy general managers responsible for production, sales and procurement,
personnel and training, and capital construction; (b) a chief engineer
responsible for all technical matters; and (c) a chief accountant. At the
Company level, there are 19 functional departments which provide various
services for the subsidiaries. Each plant/unit is managed by a plant
manager who is assisted by several deputy plant managers. The nitrogenous
fertilizer plant has three deputy plant managers, a chief engineer and a
chief accountant.
19.       NCIC maintains monthly production, distribution and financial
plans, which are prepared on the basis of annual production and investment



- 50 -
ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 8
targets established by the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Jiangsu Province
in consultation with SPC and MCI. Each plant unit of NCIC is responsible
for preparing their respective monthly plans, which are integrated into the
Company's plans. The production technical department under the deputy
general manager for production monitors production performance through
comparison of actual performance with plan targets for production, input
consumption, condition of equipment, and quality of products. The results
of the variance analyses each month are reported to the Chemical Industry
Bureau and MCI.  "aterials, labor and funds for different categories of
activities are allocated in the annual budget, based on production and
investment plans. Financial performance of each plant/unit is monitored by
the financial department of the Company. At the plant level, chief
accountant is responsible for the preparation of annual budget and
monitoring of the fulfillment of financial budget targets.
20.       As of July 1984, NCIC had 29,231 employees including 6,028 or 21%
technical and administrative staff. The nitrogenous fertilizer plant has
4,650 employees, of which 664 or 14% are technical staff. However, only
268 or 5.8% of the total staff of the nitrogenous fertilizer plant have
received technical training beyond secondary school level. NCIC has been
giving priority to general education as well as technical training of its
staff both on a part-time basis as well as full-time education.
21.       The nitrogenous fertilizer plant, originally built in 1937 as a
very small-size plant, has been expanded and modified many times based on
China's own know-how. The annual production capacity and the recent
production trend of the Company's nitrogenous fertilizer plant are
su-marized in the table below.

capacity was sbutdow at erd 1983. The estimted anml prodction caacity of
the 3 rRenixg lies is about 270,00 tpy. Another line with 120,000 tpy
capacity wil  e shutin upon oompleticn of the nm sulfuric acid plant of
200,000 tpy design capacty in 1988 under the Project.
c/  Of this, only about 104,000 tpy is avilable for sales outside NCIC, and the
balance is consumed within NCIC for phosphate fertilizer productin and otber
uses.,

22.       Recent production performance of the ammonia and related units
Indicates a stable trend which is partly due to the unique plant
configuration. The plant in many cases has oversized equipment and often
with significant standby capacities. In addition, NCIC has impressive
captive capability for building machinery for nitrogenous fertilizer
plants, which has enabled extensive replacements as needed in a timely
manner. Despite such operational flexibility, many components of the
ammonia unit are worn out and as a result the efficiency of the plant has
declined resulting in high energy consumption. A major revamping of the
amonia plant will be carried out under the Project to overcome technical
bottlenecks, and in addition to increase ammonia production to 150,000 tpy
after the Project.
23.       The sulfuric acid plant had, until recently, four lines,
commissioned in 1937, 1953, 1954 and 1956, respectively. Because of their
age, corrosion and wear on many components have reached advanced levels.
One line was permanently closed at the end of 1983, and another line is
planned to be shut down upon start-up of the new sulfuric acid plant In
1988 under the Project to make up for the loss in production from these two
lines.
F.   China Fertilizer Development Center (CFDC)
24.       Objectives.  CFDC's main objectives are to: (a) provide the
coordinating role among its member research and design institutes; (b)
formulate annual and long-term plans for research and design work based on
its own review of the requirements of the industry and taking into account
research schemes proposed by member institutes; (c) monitor and review
progress of research schemes and make changes as necessary; (d) disseminate
research results; (e) evaluate the techno-economic appropriateness of
technology to China; (f) carry out planning for pilot plant, semi-
commercial trials and commercialization of the developed technology; (g)
develop a central technical information system for easier exchange of
information among member institutes; and (h) formulate and carry out
coordinated training for technical staff.
25.       Organization.  The direction and management of CFDC are exercised
by a Board of Directors consisting of 28 members. The Deputy Minister of
the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) is the Chairman of the Board.
Executive management of CFDC is vested in the Managing Director who is also
a member of the Board. Nearly all members of the Board are officials of
MCI and agencies/enterprises under it. Therefore, in practice, CFDC's
activities are supervised closely by MCI. The CFDC management staff are
headquartered in Shanghai and are able and experienced. The Managing
Director is assisted by a deputy managing director and the office of the
chief engineer, which will have six senior engineers. CFDC has four
departments: (a) planning department for planning and monitoring of
research; (b) development department for evaluation and commercialization
of research; (c) technical services department for technical services
information and training; and (d) a small administrative office. CFDC
plans to have an initial staff of about 50, which would be expanded to some
200 staff in the future.
26.       The CFDC's budget for 1984 was about US$1.8 million (Y 5 million)
and is estimated at US$3.6 milL-on (Y 10 million) for 1985.  Funds to CFDC



- 52 -
ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 8
are provided by the National Science Committee for specific research
projects, National Economic Committee as grant allocations, development
fund of MCI for specific activities, and by the fertilizer industry. In
the future, CFDC expects to generate additional funds in fees by
commercialization of new technology developed by its member institutes.
The overall budget of the member research and design institutes in 1983
amounted to some US$11.4 million (T 32 million), financed mainly by
government agencies as budget allocations and fertilizer industry for
services. While some funds for general expenditures will continue to be
provided to the research and design institutes by government agencies as
budget allocations, an increasing proportion of their financing will come
from allocations from CFDC for specific projects.
27.       Future Research Direction.  The research and development work of
CFDC would stress the following five areas: (a) energy-saving in
nitrogenous fertilizer plants; (b) mining and beneficiation techniques for
phosphate rocks; (c) technology for the production of sulfuric acid and
phosphate fertilizers; (d) technology for the production of potash
fertilizers; and (e) improved methods for fertilizer application. The
above focus is well placed.

CHINA - FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
NITROGENOUS FERTILIZER PRODUCTION COST STUDY
AN OUTLINE
Background
1.        China has a large number (about 1,270) of nitrogenous fertilizer
plants, most of which were built during the last two decades. They include
some 1,200 small-size plants, about 55 medium-size plants and 14 large-size
ammonia/urea plants. China's nitrogen fertilizer industry is based on a
wide range of plant capacities, technology and feedstocks. Nitrogen
production is dominated by ammonium bicarbonate (about 58Z) and urea (30%)
and the balance is mainly ammonium nitrate and aqueous ammonia. Generally,
energy consumption is much higher than today's levels for modern plants.
The Government's strategy in the nitrogenous fertilizer industry is to
undertake programs to improve efficiency of the existing plants through
energy saving measures and technical rehabilitation, especially of large-
and medium-size plants. Accordingly, further understanding on the
cost structure of fertilizer production is necessary to develop a basis
for: (a) evaluating operational and energy efficiencies of nitrogen
fertilizer production; and (b) developing strategies for modernization of
the fertilizer industry. While adequate data is already available for the
large-size plants including the four such plants under the Project, there
is need to develop such data for medium-size plants for which the potential
for improvements in efficiency is substantial.
Scope
2.        The aim of the proposed cost study, to be undertaken by the
Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI), will be to generate comprehensive data
and to carry out analysis on the production cost structure of the
medium-size nitrogen fertilizer plants that will help meet above objectives
(para 1). For this purpose, the study will cover about 5-10 selected
medium-size nitrogen fertilizer plants, which represent a sample of plants
in terms of different age, locations, technology and feedstocks.
Study Team
3.        The study is to be carried out by a Study Team to be organized by
MCI. The Study Team would be staffed by representati-ss of the Planning,
Technical and Finance Departments of MCI and will oe assisted by relevant
staff of the selected plants.
Study Development Plan
4.        The study is envisaged to be carried out as follows:
(a) Preparation of methodology and selection of representative
plants for the study.

ANNEX 4-3
Page 2 of 2
(b)  Collection of technical data on the selected plants and data
on their production costs.
(c) Analysis to identify production efficiency of each sample
plant in terms of energy consumption and production costs.
(d) Identification and analysis of likely measures and
investments that may be required to reduce production costs
and improve plant efficiency, taking into account their
technical, financial and economic viability.
(e) Analysis on implications of above information for policy
instruments to provide incentives for producers to improve
efficiency and thereby fostering innovation and improvements
in productivity.
Report Preparation and Consultation
5.        The study is expected to be completed during the next 18 months
and MCI would share the study's findings with the Bank.

RAW MATERIALS SUPPLY
A. Natural Gas
1.        The present natural gas supply position varies significantly
among the plants.
2.      The Luzhou and Yunnan fertilizer plants located in the Sichuan and
Yunnan Provinces, respectively, are fed by the Sichuan gas network (non-
associated gas). The yearly output of natural gas from the Sichuan gas
fields was about 5 billion Nm3 in 1983. Of this, about 4.2 billion Nm3
were consumed in Sichuan and 0.8 billion Nm3 in the Yunnan and Guizhou
Provinces. The breakdown of gas consumption in the Sichuan Province in
1983 was as follows:
Use                    Consumption              X
(billion NmJ)
Chemical industry                   2.02                48
Metallurgical industry              0.54                13
Mechanical industry                 0.54                13
Textile                             0.34                 8
Others                              0.76                18
Total                      4.20               100
The natural gas consumption for the Sichuan chemical industry is mainly for
fertilizer production and for a synthetic fibers plant.
3.        The Sichuan gas production has declined in recent years (the peak
production was in 1979 at 6.5 billion Nm3). As a result, the chemical
industries, which account for about 48% of gas consumption and though still
operating well, have not been able to achieve their full capabilities. For
example in 1984, the capacity utilization rate of the old, medium-size
ammonia plant at Luzhou was 84%, and the large ammonia plant at Yunnan
operated at 83%.  The potential for expanded gas production in the Sichuan
Province is, however, quite high. Gas zones in many of the producing
fields remain untapped. Gas reserves have also been proven in several
large structures in the east and south of the Sichuan basin, though they
are yet to be fully tested. The Government intends to gradually increase
gas output to 7 and 10 billion Nm3 per year by 1990 and 2000, respectively,
through (a) development of multiple gas layers within each producing field;
(b) drilling deeper to tap new gas horizons; and (c) stepping up
exploration and drilling activities. The proposed build up of gas
production up to 1990 is given on the following page.

Year                billion Nm3

1986                     5.4
1987                     5.8
1988                     6.2
1989                     6.6
1990                     7.0
Of the planned gas production of 7 billion Nm3 in 1990, about 6 billion Nm3
will be consumed within the Sichuan Province and 1 billion Nm3 in nearby
provinces. The Sichuan authorities have requested SPC to approve a
long-term gas allocation plan under which fertilizer industries would be
considered priority consumers. The Bank is currently processing a proposed
technical assistance loan for the development of the Jeiyuan gas field in
the Sichuan basin with the objective of designing a rehabilitation program
to maximize the ultimate recovery of gas reserves. However, even if the
expected increase in gas production in the Sichuan Province is delayed,
which is unlikely, the current level of gas allocated to the Luzhou and
Yunnan plants at about 0.95 billicn NmP or 20% of the present gas
production in Sichuan will be sufficient to allow plant operations at full
capacity (including 50X capacity expansion of the old medium-size
ammonia/urea plant at Luzhou) because of savings in energy consumption
under the Project.
4.        The Cangzhou fertilizer plant (Hebei Province) is based on
associated gas from Dagang oil fields. Natural gas production at Dagang
has been declining at a rate of 7%-8% per year. Gas production in 1983 was
0.6 billion Nm3 compared with 0.9 billion Nm3 in 1979. About 0.16 billion
Nm3 was self consumed at the oil field. Of the 0.44 billion Nm3 available
for sales in 1983, the Cangzhou plant received 0.3 billion Nm3. Starting
185, the Dagang field is expected to supply ibout 0.25 billion Nm3 of gas
to the Cangzhou plant. Gas production from the Dagang field is expected to
cease by 1995. To maintain operations at the Cangzhou plant, which have
been severely curtailed in the past mainly due to the shortage of gas
(capacity utilization rates were: 78X in 1982, 52% in 1983, and 56% in
1984), the Ministry of Petroleum Industry started in 1984 the construction
of a gas pipeline to supply gas to the Cangzhou plant from the Zhongyuan
fields (Henan Province). The pipeline is scheduled for completion by the
end of 1985. The Bank is assisting China in the development of oil fields
in the Zhongyuan basin under the Bank financed Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum
Project (2252-CHA). About 0.3 billion Nm3 of the gas production from the
Zhongyuan fields would be allocated to the Cangzhou plant to enable
fertilizer production at full capacity.

5.        The Liaohe fertilizer plant (Liaoning Province) receives gas
through an 18 km long pipeline from the Panjing oil field, close
Yingkou. Current gas output from Panjing is about 1.2 billion Nm per year
of associated gas, of which 0.4 billion Nm3 are for own use at Panjing
where a refinery is also located, and 0.8 billiou ,im3 are available for
sales. About 0.45 billion Nm per year of gas is supplied tc the Liaohe
plant, which is sufficient to operate the plant at full load. The
remaining amount of gas is for a 200 tpd ammonia plant, other small-size
fertilizer plants, and a synthetic fibers plant. Gas production from
Panjing has slightly declined in the past, as shown below.
(in blllion Na3)
Year             Gas Output        Gas Available for Sales
i98i                 1.5                      0.9
1982                 1.2                      0.8
1983                 1.2                     0.8
1984                 1.2                      0.8
Future gas production from the Panjing oil field is expected to be
maintained at about 1.2 billion Nmi until 2000.
B.   NrTHRACITE AND PYRITES
6.        NCIC receives anthracite for its ammnia plant from the Zhencheng
(Shanxi Pro'incl. and Jinzhuo (Runan Province) mines located at a distance
of 900 km and 800 km, respectively, from Nanjing. NCIC's requirements for
anthracite after the Project are estimated at about 285,000 tons.
Production capacity of these coal mines is about one and six million tpy,
respectively.
7.        Pyrites for the existing sulfuric acid plan e at Nanjing are
received from the Yungping copper mine in the Jiangxi Province, located
at a distauce of some 800 km from Nanjing. Pyrites for the new sulfuric
acid plant under the Project will also be supplied from the same copper
mine, NCIC's annual requirements for pyrites for the new sulfuric acid
plant are estimated at about 176,000 tons. The annual production capacity
of pyrite concentrate 'rom the Yungping mine is about one million tons.
8.        Anthracite and pyrites are transported to NXnjing by rail and
barges. The transportation system is adequate to handle the required
amount of raw materials for the Project after rehabilitation. There is no
risk of shortage or problems of quality at the mines for both anthracite
and pyrites.

CHINA - FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis for Projections
1.        Project life is assumed to be about 12 years after rehabilitation
with no salvage value at the end. The financial projections have been
carried out in current yuan using the following inflation rates: (a)
annual domestic inflation of 3% p.a.; and (b) international inflation rates
of 5Z in 1985, 7.5Z in 1986, 8% p.a. in 1987-1990, and 5% p.a. in 1991 and
thereafter. The cost and benefit streams were deflated to real January
1985 terms for calculating financial rates of return in constant terms.
The assumptions used for capacities and capacity utilization with and
without the Project and the forecast production levels are given in
Table 1.
B.   Income Statements
2.        Sales Revenue.  Net sales revenues are calculated after deducting
product tax at the rate of 20% on chemical fertilizers and other chemicals
for the natural gas-based fertilizer plants of LNGCC, YNGCC, CCFC and
LCFC. For NCIC, a product tax of 5% on chemical fertilizers
(anthracite-based plant), and 10Z for other chemicals including sulfuric
acid has been used.
3.        Variable Production Costs.  Annual consumptions of inputs are
based on the material and utility balances before and after the Project for
each plant. Details of consumption of raw materials and utilities, and
output before and after rehabilitation by plants are given in Project File.
4.        Depreciation.  In line with the plants' present practices, fixed
assets are depreciated using the straight line method at rates (as a
percentage of the original value of fixed assets) determined differently
for each plant as follows: (i) Nanjing - 6.0%; (ii) Luzhou - 6.6% for the
large-size plant and 3.3% for the medium-size plant; (iii) Cangzhou, Yunnan
and Liaohe - 6.0%.
5.        Maintenance Cost.  In the Chinese accounting system, provisions
for annual overhaul are provided as a percentage of the original value of
fixed assets to cover regular overhaul expenses: (i) Nanjing - 4.5%; (ii)
Luzhou - 4% for the large-size plant and 35% of the accumulated
depreciation for the medium-size plant before plant rehabilitation. Upon
completion of the Project, the provision for the annual overhaul for the
medium-size plant would be 4%; and (iii) Cangzhou, Yunnan and Liaohe - 5%.
Other maintenance costs are based on past experience.
6.        Interest Expense.  The outstanding balances and interest expenses
for the IBRD loan are calculated in US dollars and converted into yuans
using the foreign exchange rates based on purchasing power parity.

ANNEX 7-1
Page 2 of 2
7.        Taxes.  In line with the Chinese tax system, the taxable income
is derived from net profits after deducting amortization for long-term
loans. Taxable profits are taxed at a uniform income tax rate of 55%. In
addition, there are adjustment taxes as follows: (i) Nanjing - a fixed
amount of Y 20.6 million for 1985 and 19&S, and 20% thereafter; (ii) Luzhou
- 34.5%; (iii) Cangzhou - 35%; (iv) Yunnan - 22.5X; and (v) Liaohe - 33%.
While the adjustment tax rates are expected to decline in the future, they
are conservatively assumed to remain constant.
C.   Balance Sheet
8.        Fixed Assets.  Gross fixed assets are shown at their historical
costs. Net fixed assets after deducting accumulated depreciation are
matched with fixed assets' funding sources such as the state fixed funds,
capital construction loans, etc.
9.        Equity in the Chinese context covers four major items: (i)  fixed
funds given by the State; (ii) circulating funds given by the State; (iii)
enterprise fixed funds from internal sources; and (iv) special funds
retained by the enterprise.
D. Funds Flow Statement
10.       Depreciation Fund.  It is assumed that 70% of the depreciation
fund will be retained by the companies and the balance remitted to the
Government. For NCIC, however, the Government has allowed it to retain
100% of the depreciation fund until 1988.
11.       Expenditures from Special Funds.  Provisions for annual overhaul
are assumed to be fully spent to cover overhaul expenses. Annually, 15% of
the retained depreciation fund and profit is taken out of the special funds
for contribution to the Energy Conservation Fund. Other expenditures to be
covered from the special funds are: (i) 20Z of retained profits for the
improvement of workers' living condition; and (ii) 20% of retained profits
for cash bonuses to workers.
E. Consolidation of Financial Statements for NCIC
12.       Sales revenues and operating costs for NCIC's other operations
(phosphate fertilizer production, cement production, construction unit,
machinery manufacturing, etc.) were forecast based on historical trends
between 1979 and 1984. These were used for preparing financial projections
for operations of NCIC other than the nitrogen fertilizer plant. Detailed
financial projections for the nitrogen fertilizer plant were consolidated
with those for all other operations to provide an appraisal of the
Company's overall finances.

ANNEX 8-1

CHINA-FERTILIZER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   General
1. *The economic rates of return (ERR) are calculated on an
incremental basis for the Luzhou, Yunnan, Cangzhou, Tiaohe and Nanjing
nitrogeu fertilizer plants. For purposes of economic analysis, the sulfuric
acid plant at Nanjing is treated as a new plant. Calculations are in
constant January 1985 dollar terms. At the end of the economic life of the
Project in year 2000, the salvage value of investments has been assumed to
be zero. Duties and taxes are excluded from all cost and benefit streams.
The assumptions for increase in capacity utilization and incremental
production due to the Project are explained in Table 1 of Annex 7-1. The
following conversion factors are applied to the financial prices of local
currency components of the capital cost, non-traded goods and other items
to convert them to economic prices:
Item                                         Conversion Factor
Unskilled Labor                                          0.50
Technical Labor                                          4.00
Managerial/Administrative Labor                          1.00
Electricity                                              1.50
Rail Transport                                           1.00
Lubricants                                               0.54
Timber                                                   2.15
Steel                                                    1.13
Local Machinery                                          1.34
Construction Work                                        1.08
B.   Capital Cost
2.        The economic capital cost of the Project is based on the base
financial capital cost expressed in January 1985 prices after deducting (a)
duties and taxes on equipment and other items; (b) the costs of those spare
parts which are included in operating costs; and (c) the costs of training
aids and training as their benefits are unquantifiable. Conversion factors
(para. 1 above) were applied for adjusting the cost of locally procured
items. Table I of this Annex summarizes the adjustments made to financial
capital costs.
C.   Working Capital
3.        No significant increase in the working capital is required for
the Project because of its rehabilitation nature and energy saving
modifications.

ANNEX 8-1
Page 2 of 3
D.   Economic Benefits
4.        Economic prices of products are projected using the latest
projections for international prices prepared by the Bank's Commodity
Studies and Projections Division plus marine freight, unloading, port
handling charges and inland rail freight to the plant sites. Marine
freights, estimated from the most recent statistics, are assumed to change
in line with international energy costs. Port handling charges and railway
freight, obtained from the Chinese tariffs tables, are converted to
economic costs by applying specific conversion factors (para 1).
5.        Projections of economic prices of each product are given in
Table 2 of this Annex. Key assumptions are summarized below:
(a) Urea (bulk) is imported from West Europe and bagging is done
at the Chinese ports.
(b) Ammonia. The economic value of ammonia (FOB) is assumed to
equal the price of bulk urea (FOB).
Cc) Ammonium Nitrate. Since ammonium nitrate (AN) is not
actively traded in the international market, it is assumed
that China will import urea to meet the shortage in nitrogen
fertilizers. The price of ammonium nitrate is, therefore,
derived from the urea price, taking into account their
nutrient contents (AN, 34.5% N; Urea, 46Z N). A price
premium of 15% in favour of AN is assumed to reflect the
price structure prevailing in major fertilizer markets in
the world. The economic price of industrial grade ammonium
nitrate is assumed to be 30% higher than the fertilizer
grade AN price, again in line with their relative prices in
the international market.
(d) Methanol. The historic prices of methanol have been at
about 52% of the prices of premium gasoline over the past 10
years. Methanol prices are, therefore, estimated at 52% of
the projected premium gasoline prices at the Singapore
market.
(e) Sulfuric acid is conservatively assumed to be manufactured
locally using imported sulfur from Canada. The price of
sulfuric acid is based on prices of sulfur and fuel oil
projected by the Bank and estimated capital cost of about
US$105/ton of design capacity.
E.   Operating Costs
6.        Tradeable Raw Materials. The economic costs of exportable inputs
were derived by adding to the netback prices from exports, the inland
transportation costs between the production sites of inputs and the plant
sites. The netback to China from exportable inputs is calculated by
deducting inland freight (from the origin to exporting ports) from the FOB



- 94 -
ANNEX 8-1
Page 3 of 3
export prices. The calculations and projections of economic prices of
exportable inputs are given in Table 3 of this Annex. Key assumptions are
summarized below.
(a) Anthracite for the Nanjing plant is to be supplied from a
coal mine in the Shanxi Province. The delivered economic
prices at the plant site are derived based on the
international prices of anthracite projected by the Bank.
(b) Pyrite concentrate is a by-product produced at the Yungping
copper mine in the Jiangxi Province. Although, pyrite
concentrate is not actively traded in the international
market, its export price at the mine is calculated, based on
its relative price to projected world sulfur prices, after
deducting transportation costs from the mine to the Shanghai
port.
(c) Natural Gas. The economic value of natural gas is assumed to
be equivalent to that of fuel oil based on its calorific
value. Since China is a net exporter of fuel oil, the
economic value of fuel oil is based on the netback prices
received from exports of fuel oil to Singapore. The
international price of fuel oil is expected to move in line
with international crude oil prices, as currently projected
by the Bank, taking into account the product/crude price
ratios projected on the basis of expected worldwide fuel oil
supply and demand.
7.        Other operating costs. The economic costs for utilities such as
purchased power and steam, and for bags and chemicals are derived from the
financial costs by applying specific conversion factors given in para 1.
8.        Fixed costs comprising labor, repairs and maintenance, overhead
and selling costs are based on financial costs adjusted by the following
conversion factors:
Fixed Cost Item                            Conversion Factor
Direct Labor                                              0.50
Repairs and Maintenance
Labor                                         4.00
Spare parts                                   1.34
Overhead and Selling Cost                                 1.00
