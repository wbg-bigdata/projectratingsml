MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE GAS UTILIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$86.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate and would help finance the Gas Utilization
Project.
2.       Background.  Indonesia is endowed with large and diverse energy
resources consisting of oil (9 billion bbl), natural gas (106 TCF), coal
(4.4 billion tons), hydropower (320,000 MW), and geothermal energy (10,000
MW). Its total primary energy production is around 804 boe annually, of
which about 652 is exported, with oil accounting for 742, natural gas for
251 and coal for 12. The energy sector is Indonesia's single largest
source of foreign exchange earnings. Currently, oil accounts for 86Z and
natural gas for only 1X of the domestic energy consumption. Since the
country depends on oil for a major part of its energy exports, a major
objective of the Government policy has been to maintain the level of oil
export earnings by diversification of domestic energy consumption away from
petroleum products towards alternative fuels for which there is a non-
exportable surplus (natural gas and coal) or which are non-tradeable
(hydropower and geothermal energy). Given the abundance of gas reserves
that can be developed at low costs, the natural gas subsector offers wide
opportunities for pursuing this strategy.   The long-run marginal cost of
natural gas supply is estimated at US$0.50 to US$1.50 per MPF depending on
the field, which is less than half the international price of petroleum
product fuels (equivalent to over US$3.OIMCF). Therefore, the Government
is promoting expanded production and use of natural gas as substitute fuel
for the power and industrial sectors thus releasing more oil for export.
High priority has been given to the regions of East Java and North Sumatra
where recent findings have confirmed the adequacy of gas reserves near the
major economic centers of Surabaya and Medan.
3.       Key Sector Issues and GOI's Policy.  The dominant issues in the
gas subsector relate to: (a) development of a regulatory framework to
promote safe and efficient utilization of natural gas; (b) establishment of
least cost long-term gas development program; (c) creation of modern and
efficient institutions to manage natural gas transportation and
utilization; and (d) formulation of an appropriate gas pricing policy.



-2-
4.       The Government's strategy to encourage economic substitution for
petroleum products in domestic energy consumption, by non-tradeable,
indigenous natural gas involves coordinated pursuit of four courses of
actionss (a) expansion of gas supply in Java and Sumatra through
efficiently phased and designed infrastructure projecg.s; (b) building of
institutions and upgrading the Indonesian expertise in gas technology; (c)
studies to help define long-term plans; and (d) formulation of a gas
pricing policy that would encourage further exploration and development of
gas resources, as well as substitution of gas for petroleum product fuels
wherever economical. This strategy has been supported by the Bank which
has been involved in Indonesia's natural gas subsector since 1981. The
Bank's support of this strategy has already resulted in: (a) a Bank-
financed on-going Gas Distribution Project (Ln. 2690-IND), (b) an energy
pricing policy study; and (c) a feasibility study (under a Dutch grant) for
a natural gas supply grid in Java being conducted under terms of reference
prepared by the Bank.
5.       Rationale for Bank's Involvement.  The implementation of the on-
going Gas Distribution Project began in December 1986; its progress has
been satisfactory and it is expected to be completed by July 1991. Through
the institution building component of this project, PGN is being
transformed into a modern gas utility. Since 1986, PGN's sales have
increased at an average rate of 362 per year and its gas losses have been
reduced from 302 to 6Z. Before 1986, PGN operated at a loss; in FY88, it
achieved breakeven, and in FY90 it made a 2.6Z return on net fixed assets
in operation, which though short of the target of 102, still reflects a
turn-around in its operations.   The proposed project includes measures to
enable PGN to achieve the targeted rate of return by 1995 (para 8 below)
and should be considered as a follow-up operation to consolidate the gains
being made under the on-going project and to build institutions and
regulatory framework to manage the long-term development of the sub-sector.
Through project financing and ensuing policy dialogue, the Bank will
continue to assist in accelerating the economic expansion of natural gas
utilization in the country.
6.       Project Obiectives.  The primary objective of the project is to
support the Government's policy of substituting petroleum product fuels
with natural gas. This objective will be pursued through:
(a) the provision of an assured supply of natural gas, at
competitive prices, to power plants, manufacturing industries,
and commercial entities in Surabaya and twelve other towns in
its vicinity in East Java, and in Medan in North Sumatra;
(b) the integration of gas utilization plans and operations to
achieve economies of scale in the development and operation of
the gas supply infrastructure; and
(c) institution building, technology transfer, and marketing
studies to promote safe and efficient utilization of natural
gas and adequate long-term sector development.
7.       Project Description.  The project comprises an investment and a
technical assistance component. The investment component (US$74.5 million
excluding contingencies) provides for the detailed design, construction,
testing and commissioning of gas supply systems involving about 104 Km of



-3-
high pressure and about 355 Km of medium pressure natural gas transmission
and distribution networks, pressure regulating stations, service lines and
customer meter stations for the supply of natural gas to 375 manufacturing
and 150 commercial entities in Surabaya and its environs, and additional
supply for two power stations in Medan. The technical assistance component
(US$18.2 million excluding contingencies) will comprise (i) enhancement of
PGN's skills and project implementation capabilities through the extension
of its technical collaboration (twinning) arrangement with British Gas or
through a similar arrangement with another experienced gas utility; (ii)
establishment of a Gas Technology Development Unit in LEMIGAS; and (iii)
upgrading of skills in MIGAS to facilitate the coordination of development
plans in the gas sector and to institute a regulatory system for the safe
utilization of natural gas. In addition, MIGAS, with the assistance of PGN
and its twinning partner, will conduct studies into the feasibility of
distributing and marketing natural gas in Palembang (South Sumatra), Jambi
(Central Sumatra), Batam Island (Riau) and Balikpapan (East Kalimantan).
The total financing requirement for the project is estimated at US$118.8
million with a foreign exchange component of US$99.1 million (83Z). The
Bank loan will cover all foreign exchange costs of the project, except for
interest during construction (IDC) and the cost of PGN's technical
collaboration (twinning), which will be funded by the Government and
bilateral assistance respectively. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) would
onlend a portion of the proceeds of the loan (US$76.0 million) to the State
Gas Corporation (PGN), at an interest rate of 13Z per annum.   US$10.0
million would be used by the Government for establishing the Gas Technology
Development Unit in LEMIGAS, training of MIGAS staff and feasibility
studies for natural gas marketing. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The route maps of the existing
and proposed principal gas pipelines are attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8112-IND, dated May 8, 1990 is being distributed separately.
8.       Actions Agreed.  Agreements were obtained from the Government that
it will: (a) provide PGN and LEMIGAS with sufficient funds for the timely
implementation of the Surabaya and Medan components of the project and for
the establishment of the Gas Technology Development Unit; and (b) ensure
that PGN obtains, in a timely fashion, the necessary tights of way and way
leave for the pipelines to be built under the project.  Agreement was also
reached with PGN that it will: (a) prepare by the end of each fiscal year,
a rolling five-year plan of its future gas requirements and annual
investment plans and submit these plans to the Bank for comment; and (b)
take all necessary measures, including the implementation of an efficiency
improvement program, to produce a rate of return (ROR) on its revalued net
fixed assets of not less than 42 in FY91, 52 in FYs92-93, 82 in FY94 and
102 thereafter, and to review its operations annually with the Bank to
determine if the 102 ROR target can be achieved before FY95. (PGN would
have achieved the target of 1OZ rate of return by FY89, if the devaluation
of Rupiah resulting in increased cost of gas and the adverse movement in
the prices of competing fuels had not occurred. As both of these factors
were beyond PGN's contol and the economic argument for increased domestic
use of gas remained unassailable, the Bank agreed to the Government's
request to postpone the target year for achieving a 102 rate of return,
covenanted under Loan 2690-IND, from FY89 to FY95, subject to the
implementation of an efficiency improvement program.)



-4-
9.       In addition, the following were agreed as special conditions for
loan effectiveness and disbursement: (a) for loan effectiveness: (i) the
execution of gas supply contract between PGN and PERTAMINA, acceptable to
the Bank, covering the gas requirements under the project; and (ii) the
execution of a technical assistance agreement, acceptable to the Bank, with
an established gas utility, to assist PGN in the implementation of the
project; (b) for disbursement of funds allocated for the Gas Technology
Development Unit: (i) the Borrower's approval of its organization and
implementation schedule as determined by its planning study; (ii) the
execution of a technical assistance agreement, acceptable to the Bank, with
an established gas technology institute; and (c) for disbursement of funds
for marketing studies: the Bank's approval of the terms of reference and
the expertise to be employed.
10.      Benefits.  The main benefits of the project aret (a) substitution
of low value natural gas for high value petroleum products for power
generation and manufacturing industry thus releasing more oil for export;
(b) strengthening of institutions so as to improve efficiency in the gas
sector; and (c) reduction of environmental pollution and forest depredation
with the replacement of polluting fossil fuels and wood by relatively clean
natural gas. The project is expected to yield an economic rate of return
of about 591 for the Medan an.i Surabaya components combined.
11.      Risks.  The main risk is delayed project start-up due to delays in
finalizing a gas supply contract between PERTAMINA and PGN; to minimize
this risk, an agreement on gas supplies will be a condition of loan
effectiveness. The risk of delayed project implementation will be
minimized by extensive use of turnkey contracts.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
