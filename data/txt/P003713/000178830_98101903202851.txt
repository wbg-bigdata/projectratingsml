TEA PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the rehabilitation of two
groups of Government-owned tea estates in West Java, Indonesia. The estate
industry, as a whole, producing a wide range of crops besides tea, is one
of Indonesia's largest earners of foreign exchange, recently contributing
15-20% of the value of all exports. The industry suffered severely during
World War II and during the subsequent sustained period of political and
economic instability, lasting until 1966, so that production is now less
than half what it was in 1938. The unsettled state of the country, and
lack of funds for investment (particularly foreign exchange), combined
with inexperienced management, have hindered the return to pre-war produc-
tivity. Tea now accounts for 5% of agricultural export revenue, whereas
pre-war it accounted for 16%. Tea yields and quality have declined, but
can be raised again by improving cultivation methods and processing facil-
ities.
ii.       The project is the rehabilitation of about 21,000 ha of existing
tea, new planting of 2,300 ha tea and 1,100 ha cinchona (quinine) and the
reorganization and re-equipment of the estates' tea factories. Twenty-five
of the twenty-six tea estates and one cinchona estate in the Perusahan Negara
Perkebunan (PNP) XII and XIII groups would benefit. Technical assistance
would be provided to strengthen management and to introduce up-to-date tea
cultivation and processing methods; tea research would be improved, and a
survey would be made of the presently depressed and inefficient smallholder
and private estate tea industries, aimed at finding ways to rehabilitate them.
iii.      The two PNP are being converted into Perseroan Terbatas (PT),
which, while wholly Government-owned, are corporate bodies with share
capital, required to operate, unlike PNP, under the Commercial Code; each
has a Supervisory Board to lay down policy and a Management Board to carry
it out. The switch to more commercial forms of management and operation
should help in the efficient implementation of the project and the conversion
would be a condition of disbursement.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$25M, of which about US$15M
(60%) would be the foreign exchange component. It is proposed that an IDA
credit of US$15M be made to Government and that, of this, US$14.2M equiva-
lent be on-lent to the PT as loans with interest at 12% per year, the
current lending rate to public sector enterprises. The balance of the IDA
credit (US$0.8M) would finance tea research and a smallholder and private
estate tea survey. The balance of project costs would be met from self-
generated funds and, in the case of research and the survey, by Government.
All PT procurement during the six-year project disbursement period would be
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
v.        Indonesia has a comparative advantage as a low cost producer of
tea. Initially about 90% of project tea and all project cinchona products



- ii -
would be exported. This could change quite rapidly for tea, however, since
local tea demand is expanding in a market currently undersupplied because
Government requires its estates to export as much as possible and earn
foreign exchange. At peak production in about 1985, the net incremental
annual value of project tea, at world prices, would be about US$13M and
increased annual revenue accruing to Government, including corporation tax
but excluding provisions for replanting, would be about US$7M equivalent.
Project-generated products from cinchona (principally quinine sulfate),
harvested every seven or eight years, would earn about US$20M during the
project's 20-year life. The estimated rate of return to the economy is 26%
at world tea prices forecast by the Bank.
vi.       The project would be similar in many respects to the North Sumatra
Estates oil palm and rubber projects 155-IND for US$16M and 194-IND for
US$17M. These have not made as good progress as envisaged at appraisal,
mainly due to organizational and managerial problems, now gradually being re-
solved, and, in the case of one estate group, lower than estimated rubber
prices. Government is receptive to IDA views and recommendations, but estate
group management is slow to make changes in methods and systems, particularly
in the commercial and financial aspects of their operations. The fall in
rubber prices and rise in palm product prices, resulting in amounts of self-
generated funds substantially different from appraisal estimates, highlights
the sensitivity of projects of this type to short-run fluctuations in world
commodity prices. Many of the problems of these North Sumatra projects stem
from poor contact with Djakarta. The tea project would be in West Java
and have good communication with Djakarta; it would also benefit from the
experience gained in organizing the North Sumatra projects.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US15M to the Gov-
ernment of Indonesia.



INDONESIA
TEA PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In April 1970, at the request of the Indonesian Government, IDA
commissioned the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to survey the
Indonesian tea industry and help in identifying and preparing a project suit-
able for IDA financing. In June-September 1970, CDC identified a project on
Government estates in West Java for the rehabilitation of about 22,000 ha of
tea, with new planting of some 2,000 ha tea and 1,100 ha cinchona (quinine).
Project preparation followed in September-December 1970, assisted by a CDC
mission led by Mr. T. Phillips (formerly with the Bank Resident Staff in
Indonesia). The project now presented aims to restore productivity and tea
quality on these estates. The Bank Economic Mission to Indonesia in 1969 1/
concluded that export crops, including tea, should have priority.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission,
comprising Messrs Nelson, Elz, Ringskog (IDA), Henderson (Agricultural
Consultant) and Taylor (Tea Manufacturing Consultant), that visited Indo-
nesia in October/November 1970. The mission was advised by Mr. T. Creyke
of the Resident Staff.
II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Indonesian Archipelago is some l.9M km2, with an estimated
population of 120 M increasing at about 2.9% per year. Java (population
75 million) and Sumatra (19 million) are the most important islands. Indo-
nesia's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1969 was about US$80.
Agriculture is dominant, accounting for nearly half the GDP, employing 70%
of the labor force, and providing 60% of export earnings. Estate production
has contributed 15-20% of export earnings in recent years, and is an
important source of Government revenue. Major export crops in 1969 were
rubber (40%)* timber (17%), coffee (11%), and oil palm products (6%). A
variety of other crops, including tea, made up the balance (26%).
2.02      Tea has declined in importance since World War II.  In 1939 it ac-
counted for 16% of agricultural exports; in 1969 for only 5%. During the
same period, tea export value (1969 parity) fell from US$60M to 13M (1970
estimate 17M) and Indonesia's proportion of world tea exports declined from
19% to 5%.

B. The Estate Sector
2.03      Before World War II, Indonesia had the largest estate industry in
the tropics. The 1942-45 Japanese occupation, post-war confrontation with
the Dutch, President Sukarno's nationalization of foreign property, lack of
funds, and loss of technical research backing and experienced management,
all contributed to the estate industry's subsequent decline, and total
estate production fell by about 50% between 1938 and 1964. Most non-Dutch
owners of previously nationalized estates have now regained control and
management, though with some continuing participation by Government. The
former Dutch-owned estates remain under State o-wnership and control.
C. The Government Estate Sector
2.04      In 1969, Government estates comprised about 610,000 ha (65% of
total planted estate area) and Government tea plantations about 39,000 ha
(60% of all estate tea). During their 13 years, Government estates have
been deprived of funds for maintenance, replanting and modernization. A
1968 reorganization and partial decentralization rearranged the estates into
28 units, known as Perusahan Negara Perkebunan (PNP), based on geographical
location, crop and size. Each PNP has an executive Board of Directors, though
many important powers, exercised through the Directorate General of Estates,
are still reserved by the Minister of Agriculture.
2.05      A final stage will be conversion of PNP into corporate bodies,
Perusahan Perseroan Terbatas (PT), semi-autonomous commercial enterprises
operating under the Commercial Code, each with its own policy-making Super-
visory Board of Directors and separate Executive Management Board.
2.06      Annex 1 has further details of the Estate Industry, Annex 2 dis-
cusses the Indonesian Tea Industry and Section V has further details of
PNP/PT organization.
D. Existing Credits to the Estate Industry
2.07      Two IDA credits have been extended to the estate industry, both
for development of oil palm and rubber, two of the most important crops in
the Indonesian economy: US$16M under 155-IND of June 20, 1969 for PNP V
and VII, and US$17M under 194-IND of June 15, 1970 for PNP IV and VI, all
in Sumatra. These projects experienced delays mainly due to organizational
problems. Management has found it hard to change from sporadic financing to
active forward planning with assured funds, and technical assistance is not
yet working smoothly in all cases. Some progress has been made, but
rehabilitation is slower than expected and managerial and organizational
problems continue, though they are gradually being resolved. Experience to
date emphasizes the importance of technical assistance, provided under
both credits, and highlights the effect of produce prices on cash flow.

A Dutch Government credit is being negotiated for PNP VIII tea estates in
North Sumatra (about 13,000 ha), and the Asian Development Bank is consider-
ing the finance of PNP II oil palm and rubber estates. IBRD is executing
agent for a UNDP survey of the Indonesian sugar industry.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. General
Project Areas
3.01      The project areas comprise one PNP XII cinchona estate (Bukittungul),
and all PNP XII and XIII tea estates (Annex 3) except one (Tjianten), which
is not profitable. Another (Bungamelur) is unsuitable for tea but is included
for cinchona (Annex 3, para 2). All are within 100 km of Bandung in West
Java where the two PNP have their headquarters. XII has about 12,000 ha tea
in 14 estates, varying in mature area from 180 to 2,300 ha, and 11,400 ha
other crops (mostly rubber). XIII has about 10,000 ha tea in 12 estates,
varying in mature area from 350 to 1,600 ha, and 9,400 ha other crops (mostly
rubber and coconut). XII and XIII produce approximately 40% of Indonesian
black tea and 55% of Government estate tea.
Land Tenure
3.02      XII and XIII derive title generally from original leases granted
by the former Dutch Administration, but botndaries and dimensions have
changed. The old leases were to have been converted into 25-year renewable
leases and re-registered by May 1972. Title registration is necessary as
protection against squatter encroachment and it would be a condition of
effectiveness that a program for registration of project estate leases on
appropriate terms had been agreed with IDA.
Labor
3.03      Labor supply is generally adequate, though estates near rice
areas have temporary shortages during rice planting and harvesting. A
large part of the wage is customarily paid in kind, i.e., rice, cloth and
kerosene, though Government hopes gradually to return to all-cash wages.
The minimum cash wage, now Rp 35 daily, is expected to increase to Rp 50
shortly. The total average cost per man-day in cash and kind is about Rp 105.
Adding the value of free housing, medical care and other fringe benefits,
the total would be about Rp 120 (US$0.32). This is lower than in Sumatra
(about US$0.45) where labor is less plentiful and supplies in kind (about 75%
of wage cost) are more expensive. Compared with other tea-growing countries,
it is also lower than Ceylon (US$0.51) but about equivalent to India (US$0.34).

B. Climate and Soils
3.04      The project area has a moderately humid tropical climate, with a
relatively dry season June/September which, when pronounced (about onc -in
five years), seriously reduces yields of some crops, including tea. Tempera-
tures vary more with elevation than with season; in the lowlands, between
23C and 32C; in the interior highlands, about 6C less.
3.05      Project estates lie between 900 and 1,700 m.  Night temperatures
are cool, therefore, but frost is rare. Sunshine varies greatly betweeni
estates, averaging about six hours daily; annual rainfall ranges from 10500
mm to 4,700 mm. The climate is ideally suited to tea, except for occasional
drought and some minor wind damage. Soil types are suitable for tea and
cinchona, being generally better in XIII. Topography is easy to steep.
About 10% of the planted area is believed too steep for economic tea pro-
duction and, if confirmed by PNP management, with project technical apsis-
tance, it should be phased out.
C. Communications
3.06      Most estate roads are well planned and in good order but secondary
public roads are often poor. Local authorities are short of funds and equip-
ment and the tea estates themselves usually have to carry out any local road
improvement they need. No estate is more than a few hours by road from head-
quarters in Bandung which, in turn, is 200 km by road from Tandjung Priok,
Djakarta's port. Port facilities are adequate but both PNP complain of de-
lays due to shortage of lighters and to administrative inefficiency. Govern-
ment is being asked officially by IDA to reduce delays and formalities in
handling exports and imports for this and other IDA-financed projects.
D. Production, Marketing and Prices
Production Techniques
3.07      Indonesian teas were highly regarded before World War II.  They
have an inherent good character and flavor, now being lost through poor
field practices and inadequate processing.
3.08      Tea yields vary greatly between gardens; 250 kg/ha from areas
about to be abandoned; nearly 2,000 on better estates. Plucking standards
are low due to lack of supervision and of modern techniques for quality
production; leaf transport is primitive; and pruning is excessive, leading
to lack of bush vigor and cover (hence heavier weed growth than would occur
if bushes grew vigorously to shade weeds out). Fertilizer application has
fallen behind and the bushes have suffered accordingly. Improvements have
already been made, partly as a result of Bank Group interest and the prospect



- 5 -
of adequate financing. The Indonesian staff are eager to learn new techniques
and well able to apply them.
3.09      In the factories, though maintenance is generally satisfactory,
machinery and methods are out of date and tea quality suffers. Some fac-
tories are finding it increasingly difficult to produce tea at all, and all
would benefit from some re-equipment, including additional power plant.
Tea Marketing
3.10      PNP are, in theory, directly responsible for selling their tea,
90% of which is exported. In practice, exports are handled by a Joint
Malketing Office (JMO) in Djakarta, headed by a Marketing Director appointed
by the Minister of Agriculture. This is not entirely satisfactory because,
apart from not being effectively responsible to PNP management, the Marketing
Director handles many kinds of produce and has not been able to devote enough
time to tea. A Marketing Officer, handling only Java tea, is being appointed
in JMO by both PNP jointly.
3.11      Most Indonesian tea is sold privately to the highest bidder,
usually through Djakarta agents of overseas buyers. Dutch buyers, who had
a near monopoly before 1958, have now been joined by Australian, British
and American firms. The most important direct markets in 1969 were Holland
(28%), Australia (23%), Germany 12%), Belgium (11%) and USA (10%), though a
lot of Indonesian tea finds its way indirectly to the UK and USA. One
reason for this is that Indonesian producers prefer to sell FOB for cash,
while many buyers -- particularly in London -- prefer to buy CIF after
sampling tea at destination. Another reason is the lack of accurate and
up-to-date information on prices being paid in Indonesia. There would be
advantage, especially with the expected improvement in quality, in regular
open publication of the price, quantity, grade and estate of origin of tea
sold from Government estates. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that this would be done. Further marketing details are in Annex 4.
E. Cinchona
3.12      Before World War II, Indonesia produced 90% of the world's cin-
chona bark, used mainly for production of quinine malaricides. In 1940,
Indonesia stripped 11,000 tons of bark, processed 4,000 and exported 7,000.
Average quinine sulfate content was 6%, though material yielding 14% had
been developed. Production declined sharply with the emergence of synthetics,
but malaria has become increasingly resistant to them and interest in
quinine has revived strongly. World production is now about 4,000 tons of
bark, Indonesia accounting for about 2,700. Demand is estimated to be rising
at about 5-10% per year but the market is narrow and inelastic, quinine
sulfate prices tend to fluctuate wildly (CIF US$12/kg in 1960, 120 in 1965/66,
20-40 in 1969) and it is important to avoid overproduction.



- 6 -
3.13      Cinchona generally grows where tea will but, unlike tea, it does
not need intensive cultivation or frequent harvesting. It is therefore
suitable for land which would be good for tea were it not too steep.
3.14      The Bandung Quinine Factory (BKF) was built long before World War
II and is now Gover-nment-owned. It is quite well run but badly in need of
re-equipment. A Dutch pharmaceutical company, ACF Chemiefarma (ACF), has
agreed with BKF and XII and XIII to form a joint cinchona enterprise: ACF
to invest in new plant for processing bark, provide technical assistance,
market the product and limit its investment elsewhere in cinchona.
F. Research
3.15      The Research Institute for Estate Crops (RIEC) became responsible
for Java tea research in 1968, though in 1969 it spent only 10% of its
meager Rs 20M (US$50,000) budget on tea. RIEC headquarters at Bogor have
tea and cinchona laboratories and two minor substations nearer Bandung, one
within PNP XIII. Government is establishing a major center wholly
devoted to tea research. It would cover about 300 ha around the present
substation on XIII. Some of the present tea researchers would be transferred
there full-time and two additional highly qualified and experienced research-
ers would be recruited.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project is the rehabilitation of about 21,000 ha of existing
tea and new planting of 2,300 ha tea and 1,100 ha cinchona on 25 Government-
ovned estates together with technical assistance, tea research, and a survey
of the smallholder and private tea estate. It would revitalize an important
section of the tea industry and provide the means for its further development.
The project would be carried out over six years.
4.02      The project comprises:
(a)  rehabilitation of tea gardens through an intensive three-
year program of fertilizer application, based on leaf
analysis and other available data, preceded by weed erad-
ication with chemical weedkiller and accompanied by pest
and disease control;
(b) new tea planting on both PNP and preparation of a replant-
ing program;
(c)  new cinchona planting on two estates in XII, including
the provision of some pre-processing equipment;



(d)  improvement and addition to green leaf transport and
handling facilities and replacement of worn-out or
inefficient estate transport; provision of road mainten-
ance equipment;
(e)  rehabilitation of tea factories through repair and renewal
of worn-out and obsolete machinery, including power equip-
ment, with some factory reconstruction; consolidation and
expansion of tea factories to accommodate planned crop
increase; and provision of a small amount of office equip-
ment;
(f)  improvement and addition to labor housing;
(g)  provision of technical assistance including:
(i) an estate and factory Inspection Service and resident
Advisors, all provided by one consultancy organization;
(ii) training, including overseas visits by key staff;
(iii) tea research, including establishment in the Bandung
area of a tea research center and provision of two quali-
fied and experienced researchers for five years; and
(h) a survey of the smallholder and private estate tea industries.
4.03      4.02(a) through (f) and (g)(i) and (ii) would be carried out by
PNP XII and XIII; the rest by Government.
B. Detailed Features
Phasing and Size of Program
4.04      Substantial technical assistance would be needed, regardless of
program size. XII and XIII embrace the most important section of the tea
industry and are almost equal in importance and need of help. In five
years, rehabilitation could be virtually completed without overtaxing local
management, provided it is phased appropriately and the proposed intensity
of technical assistance is applied. The project would be based on a Five-
Year Development Plan, satisfactory to IDA, including details of field and
factory needs, prepared and implemented with the assistance and recommen-
dation of the consultancy organization. Appropriate assurances were
obtained during negotiations.
4.05      Tea garden rehabilitation would take about three years.  Phasing
of the rest of the program would be:

Garden Rehabilitation
4.06      Garden Rehabilitation is discussed in Annex 5.  Weeding is behind-
hand on most estates, partly because it takes a lot of labor (up to 150 man-
days/ha/year), which is not too plentiful for this task. Chemical weed-
killer, expensive in the first year of use, is cheaper in the long run and
eliminates weeds that are hard to get rid of by hand. More important, it
avoids damage to surface roots and thus greatly improves the ability of
the bushes to absorb applied fertilizer, especially phosphate.
4.07      Regular balanced fertilizer application has been lacking and tea
yields are well below their potential. Experience in other countries confirms
that even old, neglected tea bushes respond well to fertilizer, especially if
preceded by clean weeding, though full response may take two or three years
to show. Investment in fertilizer would be made to correct cumulative
nutrient deficiencies. It would not include subsequent normal maintenance.
Scientific leaf analysis, to determine correct fertilizer application, takes
time to prepare. It is not yet reliably available in Indonesia and a service
can and would meanwhile be provided from overseas (e.g. The Netherlands).
4.08      The project includes a concerted attack on pests and diseases,
providing fungicides and pesticides and the equipment to apply them. The
chemicals proposed are not dangerous or persistent, except for limited
amounts of DDT to be applied occasionally, and on very small areas, against
insect damage.
New Planting -- Tea
4.09      Tea bushes can last 50-100 years, but old-established estates aim
to replant annually about 1-1/2% of their tea so as to replace old bushes
and take advantage of the high yield of improved material as it becomes avail-
able. Because of its age, tea on project estates should probably be replanted
at a faster rate; but Indonesia can ill afford to jeopardize its export quota
by cutting out payable tea (Annex 4).
4.10      Fortunately, there is vacant land suitable for tea in both PNP.
The project therefore includes new planting, initially with selected seed,
but later with vegetatively propagated material as proven clones become avail-
able (Annex 6). It is important that planting material be carefully selected
and, during negotiations, assurances were obtained that only planting mater-



- 9 -
ial approved by the consultancy organization would be used and that a new
planting program satisfactory to IDA, would be adopted.
4.11      The proposed rehabilitation and new planting would probably em-
ploy field staff fully. It is uncertain whether, or at what rate, replanting
would take place after project completion. Therefore, while provision is
made in the XII and XIII financial projections for possible future replanting
(para 6.09), neither the cost of, nor the benefit from, future replanting
has been included in the rate of return calculations. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from Government that the preparation of post-project
replanting programs would be included in the Development Plan (4.04).
New Planting -- Cinchona
4.12      XII and XIII already have about 1,800 ha under cinchona.  XIII
will finance a further 700 ha from self-generated funds, and XII has 1,108
ha included in the project. Production from both PNP is expected to rise
from 420 tons bark in 1973 to over 1,900 tons by 1979. Details of the
cinchona program are in Annex 7.
Transport
4.13      Transport equipment is well maintained but is insufficient.  The
project includes additional and replacement leaf container and long-distance
trucks (125), tractor-towed trailers (85), four-wheel drive passenger
vehicles (160) and motorcycles (85).
Road Maintenance Equipment
4.14      Road maintenance equipment would be provided for essential upkeep
and improvement of estate and approach roads (Annex 10, Table 2) in accord-
ance with a road works program, satisfactory to IDA, prepared by the Produc-
tion Directors, with the recommendation of the consultancy organization.
Appropriate assurances were obtained during negotiations.
Factory Rehabilitation
4.15      The process of manufacture is described in Annex 8.  For reasons
referred to in para 3.09 and in Annex 9, virtually all stages of manu-
facture on project estates need improvement. All factories would be con-
verted to trough withering with conditioned airflow in place of "tats"
(banks of shelves on which leaf is spread to dry). The Orthodox system,
using batch rollers to crush the leaf, would be supplemented by continuous
rollers (Rotorvanes), which are fast and clean in operation, and new driers
and sorting machinery would be provided. Further details are in Annex 9.
Power
4.16      Continuous power supply is most important, especially for wither-
ing and drying fans. The estates are variously equipped with hydro, steam
or diesel generating sets. Some are connected to the grid and nearly all



- 10 -
have diesel standby. Periodic shortage of water reduces the reliability of
hydro systems; the grid, too, is often cut or below capacity, and is ex-
pensive to use. Improvements to grid transmission and distribution and
tariff revision are expected (with IDA and USAID help) but would take some
years to implement. Detailed power supply plans need specialist attention
and would be an urgent task of the consultancy organization. In the
meantime, tentative estimates have been prepared for addition to existing
high-speed (XII) and low-speed (XIII) systems (Annex 10, Table 1).
Office Equipment
4.17      Office equipment would be provided according to a schedule,
satisfactory to IDA, prepared by the Commercial Directors with the recom-
mendation of their Advisors (Annex 10, Table 3).
Housing
4.18      Housing has to be provided because most of the estates are a long
way from population centers. Present accommodation is generally satisfac-
tory; but there is not enough of it, it tends to be too centralized and much
of it needs to be upgraded with improved water supply and sanitation. Pro-
vision is included for upgrading and for the addition of housing for 1,370
families on XII and 2,000 on XIII.
Technical Assistance
4.19      Technical assistance would bring the latest methods to the es-
tates and strengthen management (paras 5.05 to 5.07). Draft terms of Refer-
ence and details of the estimated cost of the Inspection Service and Advisors
(200 man-months) are in Annex 11.
Research
4.20      Brief details of research in Indonesia are in Annex 12, which also
outlines urgent problems and includes the estimated cost of housing, labora-
tories, equipment and vehicles to be provided under the project. Two re-
searchers are expected to be recruited from outside Indonesia. Unless out-
side help and finance are provided, it is unlikely that tea research will
make much impact on the industry. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government that qualified and experienced tea research staff,
satisfactory to IDA, would be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA and that research facilities would be maintained during the life
of the project.
Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey
4.21      A Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey would be carried out
by consultants with terms of reference similar to those in Annex 13, in
which the background is also discussed. It would identify sector problems,
propose remedies, and suggest possible further projects. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Survey would be carried out under terms of
reference and by consultants acceptable to IDA.

C. Cost Estimates
4.22      Total six-year project cost is estimated at Rp 9,400 M (US$24.9M)
including contingencies, of which about US$15.3M would be the foreign ex-
change component. Estimates, including the foreign exchange component, are
based on findings in the field during appraisal. Physical contingencies
totalling about 4% of project costs are included. These are considered
adequate in view of the nature of the project and the relatively complete
knowledge of items to be purchased. Overall price contingencies are also
included, totalling some 8% of project cost. These would primarily cover
possible increases in the cost of imported items, most of which would be
purchased early in the project. No account has been taken of higher costs
due to possible domestic inflation since these would be approximately balanced
by increased revenue through adjustments to the exchange rate or through
higher domestic tea prices. Labor costs are hard to predict. Increased daily
wages are likely, but increased productivity should offset these to some ex-
tent. Labor costs (cash and kind), including contingencies, are estimated to
begin at Rp 120/day and to rise 10% in Year 2, another 10% in Year 4 and a
final 10% in Year 6. Cost details are in Annexes 7, 12 and 14, and summarized
below.

D. Financing
4.23      Proposed project financing is based on IDA providing the foreign
exchange cost, rounded to US$15M, with the estates and Government providing
the local cost, on the assumption that XII, which has a slower initial cash
flow, would be allowed to convert tax liability into Government equity if
necessary (see Cash Flows in Annex 15).  A summary of project financing is:
IDA        PT     Government    Total
-US$(thousands)-----------
XII             6,800      5,710        -          12,510
XIII            7,400      3,860        -          11,260
Research          700       -          330          1,030
Tea Survey        100       -           20            120
15,000     9,570        350        24,920
Percent           60         39         1             100
4.24      Government would on-lend the IDA credit for XII and XIII invest-
ment under subsidiary loan agreements for 16 years, including six years'
grace, at 12% per year. This is close to the current rate (1% per month) at
which the banks lend long-term for development (all except the foreign banks
are State-owned). The remaining investment cost, including additional
working capital for greater production volume, would be met from self-
generated funds. No direct Government financing of XII and XIII investment
is expected, though small amounts of short-term funds may be needed from
time to time, especially by XII. Since sales would almost all earn foreign
exchange, PT would bear the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that draft subsidiary loan agree-
ments would be submitted to IDA for approval, and it would be a condition
of disbursement for each PNP that such agreements had been signed.
Procurement
4.25      Procurement of fertilizers, other agricultural chemicals, tractors,
vehicles, power and factory equipment would be by international competitive
bidding.  This would not be appropriate for the small amount of office ma-
chinery, (US$50,000) which would be better supplied through local dealers,
though competitive quotations would be sought. Local producers would be able
to supply some of the equipment (worth about US$2M) and a margin of prefer-
ence, of 15% or the actual tariff duty, whichever is the less, was agreed
during negotiations. The numerous small housing contracts would be advertised
locally; it is unlikely that foreign firms not already operating in Indonesia
would bid.
4.26      It is important that project benefits not be dissipated by lack
of control over the use of PT funds, from whatever source. Present PNP
procurement methods are not always satisfactory and, during negotiations,
assurances were given that all procurement would follow Bank/IDA guide-
lines. Assurances were also obtained that, for goods to be financed by



- 14 -
IDA: (a) draft tender documents for all contracts exceeding US$100,000
would be submitted to IDA for approval, together with bid analyses, before
contracts were awarded; and (b) the consultancy organization would assist in
preparation of bidding documents and specifications and would comment on the
evaluation of tenders.
Disbursement
4.27      IDA would disburse against CIF documents for fertilizer and
agrocides, including sprayers and dusters (estimated US$5.8M); tractors
and vehicles, including road machinery (1.7M); factory equipment (2.3M); and
power equipment (1.2M).  For goods supplied by local manufacturers, following
international competitive bidding, e.g. withering troughs, IDA would disburse
83%, representing ex-factory price net of Indonesian duties and taxes (1.8M).
IDA would pay the foreign exchange cost of leaf analysis, research staff and
facilities (0.6M); the Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey (0.lM), and
overseas training.  IDA would also pay the total contract cost of technical
assistance (1.OM). For housing, IDA would disburse 15% and for office ma-
chinery, 83% of certified free of duty cost, being the estimated foreign ex-
change component (total 0.5M). No disbursement would be made without the
favorable recommendation of the consultancy service and its certification
that it was or would be in accordance with the approved Development Plan.
Suitable assurances were obtained during negotiations.
4.28      A disbursement schedule is at Annex 16.  Any amount not used for
the project would be cancelled.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      PNP Executive Management Boards comprise a First Director as chief
executive, a Production Director (technical) and Commercial Director (mar-
keting and finance). Estate managers are responsible to them (see Annex 1
and Chart). PT organization is similar to that for PNP except that Government
control is exercised through Directors appointed to a Supervisory Board
rather than directly; the Management Board is responsible for day to day
management; and Government equity investment is represented by share capital.
PNP policy definition arid financial control are unsatisfactory in their
present form. Policy is defined by the Ministry of Agriculture, which is
remote from management, inflexible in operation and not experienced in com-
mercial operation. It is responsible for so many PNP that it cannot direct
them effectively. Cash has been siphoned off to Government Treasury from
time to time, without regard to future investment needs, and earnings are
not considered in relation to capital employed. PNP management, under the
present system, has little incentive to maximize profits or generate cash
flow. A more commercial form of organization and management is needed for
tiw lroject.
5.02      PT have more autonomy than PNP and their organization resembles
that of commercial companies. PT Supervisory Board powers are defined in



- 15 -
each PT Charter of Incorporation and are generally similar to those of a
company Board of Directors including authority to suspend members of the
Executive Management Boards, determine policy, approve budgets and make
general plans. The Minister of Finance appoints Directors to PT Supervisory
and Management Boards but, in the case of agricultural enterprises, is
required to consult with the Minister of Agriculture, who recommends candi-
dates for the Management Boards. Government is planning to convert the
project PNP to PT and this would meet IDA requirement for a more commercial
form of organization. The Supervisior Boards would have a link to the
Directorate General of Estates in Djakarta (para 2.04) through a Chairman
conversant with Government wishes and with access to the latest technical
developments.
5.03      Most project estates have good production and financial records,
but much data is not used, or useable, for management information and
control. Commercial Directors would be assisted by Advisors with financial
training (see para 5.06) and, if the consultancy organization so recommends,
each PT should have a qualified Chief Accountant responsible directly to
the First Director for all accounting and financial matters. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that all appointments to the two
Supervisory and Management Boards and the appointment of the Chief Accountants,
if any, would be subject to prior consultation with IDA.
5.04      It would be a condition of disbursement for each PNP that it had
been formed into a separate PT, with a Supervisory Board to lay down policy
and Management Board to carry it out; and members of these Boards had been
appointed. During negotiations, draft Charters of Incorporation substan-
tially acceptable to IDA were submitted, and Government undertook that PNP
conversion to PT would take place not later than 31st December 1971.
Inspection Service and Advisors
5.05      The Inspection Service and Advisors, employed by the PT, would
be provided by a selected organization, such as a tea agency house or
consulting firm, having extensive up-to-date experience in estate rehabil-
itation and management, including vegetative propagation and Orthodox/
Rotorvane tea manufacture. The Inspection Service would visit the estates
at least twice yearly and, within one month of each visit, report fully to
each Supervisory Board with copies to the Management Board and to IDA.
Draft Terms of Reference are in Annex 11.
5.06      Each of the two Production Directors (see Chart) would have an
Advisor working through estate managers and fully associated with the Garden
Rehabilitation and New Planting programs. He would introduce modern tea
husbandry and propagation and train staff in their use at all levels. Each
of the two Commercial Directors would have an Advisor to assist with improve-
ment of headquarters and estates organization and records, including financial
reporting, sales handling and information and modernization of procurement
and stores and accounting procedures. A Tea Manufacturing Advisor would
help both XII and XIII in drawing up and implementing a factory rehabilita-
tion plan.



- 16 -
5.07      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that
an organization, satisfactory to IDA, would be engaged to provide an Inspec-
tion Service for an initial period of about five years and Advisors for an
initial period of two years, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA,
and it would be a condition of disbursement for each PNP that such organi-
zation had been appointed.
Accounts and Audit
5.08      XII and XIII balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, audited
for 1968 and 1969 and unaudited for 1970, are summarized in Annexes 17 and
18. T'he Director General of Audit is responsible for audit of PNP accounts.
His department is understaffed, audits are long delayed, and commercial
accounting principles are not generally applied. This arrangement is not
satisfactory and, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that independent auditors, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed.
Assurances would also be obtained that PT would: keep separate accounts
of funds received from Government for the project and of the uses to which
such funds were put; submit quarterly summaries of their accounts promptly
to IDA; and send a copy of their audited annual accounts to IDA within four
months of the end of their financial year.
5.09      Assurances were also obtained that the tea research center would
keep separate records of research expenditure under the project and that
the Ministry of Agriculture would keep separate records of expenditure of
the proposed Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey.
Annual Budgets
5.10      Annual budgets for project estates and any material changes in
them, would be submitted to the respective PT Boards after consultation
with and comment by the consultancy organization. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that, during the disbursement
period, these would also be submitted to IDA for comment before implementa-
tion.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
Te a
,.()1     Tea yields in kg mude tea/ha and in total are expected to increase
steadily, mainly as a result of garden rehabilitation and improved husbandry.
by 1975, average yields per ha are estimated to rise from 720 to 950 kg/ha on
XII and from 890 to 1,100 kg/ha on XIII; total production from 8,400 to
12,01)d ctns on XII and from 8,900 to 12,200 tons on XIII. Further details
are [ii Annexes 19 and 20 together witlh a forecast of the expected (declining)

yield without the project.  Forecast yields with the project are simllar to
good average estates in other countries (900-1,000 kg/ha), and should be
achievable, since tea-growing conditions in Indonesia are excellent and man-
agement would be advised by highly qualified experts. Modern high-yielding
clones can produce 3,000 kg/ha.
6.02       Quality is expected to improve markedly to medium or good medium
Ceylon as a result of improved plucking and factory rehabilitation, and the
percentage of top grades should also improve from about 45% at present to
65-70% as factory rehabilitation is completed.
Cinchona
6.03       Cinchona yields are expected to increase gradually over 10 years
from 5 to 8 tons bark/ha; the extraction rate to increase from 5% to 8%.
Details are in Annex 7.
B. Marketing and Prices
6.04       The present system  of marketing Indonesian tea is described in
paras 3.10 and 3.11. There is adequate competition from international
buyers. A commentary on market prospects and outlets for project tea produc-
tion, and on the world tea market, is in Annex 4. While overall world mar-
ket prices for tea, especially poor quality tea, are expected to decline,
the better price obtainable for the higher quality resulting from the project
would more than compensate for this. Forecast average prices of estates tea
of improving quality with the project, compared with forecast prices for es-
tates tea of the quality now produced, are (USV/kg):
Calendar Year  1972  1973  1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979
Project Year    1       2      3     4      5      6     7      8    9-20
With project    68    68    68    70    72    74    76    78    80
Without project 68    66    64    62    60    60    60    60    60
6.05       Over the next ten years this project and one in Sumatra would add
about 9,000 tons to present Indonesian tea production. The rest of the
industry is expected to decline and its output to fall by about 5,000 tons.
During this period, therefore, total tea output would increase by about 4,000
tons net, or 10% of present production. In view of high potential local
demand, it is unlikely that this would all be exported and the world tea
market, 5% of which is supplied from Indonesia, would be virtually unaffected.
The member countries of the FAO Study Group on Tea, coordinating tea
marketing action internationally, have received a statement of Bank Group
interest in tea generally and have been informed of the project. No objec-
tions have been raised.
6.06       Cinchona (quinine sulfate) prices are particularly difficult to
forecast but are expected to decline over the next decade, as supply increases

from world plantings. The following prices, forecast by PNP, seem reasonable
in the light of recent trends (para 3.12) and are used in the projections:
Project Year          1      2     3      4     5     6      7     8    9-20
US$/kg ex-factory        21.00  19.5  18.5  18.0  15.5  14.0  13.0  12.5  12.0
C.  Forecast Financial Results
Estates
6.07      Government would lend XII and XIII the equivalents of the IDA
credit made available for investment; XII about US$6.8M and XIII about
US$7.4M. Repayment over 16 years allows for maintenance of cash reserves
against possible shortfall of revenue due to unforeseen price declines when,
in particular, $ncome from other crops might not cover the indirect costs
attributable to them. Forecast cash flows in Annex 15 show that XII, with
poorer tea estates but more cinchona, could repay in 16 years if initial
tax liability is converted into equity and resulting cash surpluses are
retained, while XIII would have adequate cumulative surpluses. Both depend
on net income from other crops for net cash balances in the middle years.
To ensure that self-generated funds are retained for the tea/cinchona devel-
opment, assurances were obtained during negotiations that, during the six
year disbursement: (a) accounts for tea/cinchona would be kept separately
from those for orher crops; (b) investment in tea/cinchona would have first
claim on available cash surpluses generated by the tea/cinchona estates; and
(c) the PT would, if necessary, be furnished with funds on terms and condi-
tions preserving their financial viability.
6.08      To reflect their present worth, and as a basis for the issue of
share capital, XIII assets have been revalued, and XII assets will be, in
anticipation of conversion to PT. The financial rates of return on project
investment, excluding taxes and replanting provisions, would be almost iden-
tical with the economic rates of return discussed in Section VII. Before
project commencement, the various amounts owing by PNP to Government by way
of taxes and statutory contributions would need to be settled and actual or
intended share capital determined. During negotiations, assurances were ob-
tained that opening balance sheets, audited by Government or private auditors,
would be submitted to IDA for acceptance within three months of conversion.
Government
6.09      The disposition of available cash surpluses earned by the estates
would depend on Government policy at the time, and it is therefore difficult
to predict the effect of the project on the Government budget. Government
would lose funds generated by the estates and re-invested (about US$9.6M over
six years -- see para 4.23). On the basis of incremental net revenue fore-
cast in Annex 20, after deducting debt service and additional working capi-
tal, but including taxes payable (Annex 15), the project would generate about



- 19 -
an additional US$1.411 in Year 7, the first after completion of investineut.
about US$4.5M from Years 13-16 and US$7M annually thereafter. Retention of
funds for replanting would reduce these amounts by about US$0.7M annually.
In addition, the net surplus generated by the cinchona new planting would be
about US$12M over 18 years.
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Indonesia has a comparative advantage as a low cost producer of
tea. The project would increase the production and improve the quality
of Indonesian tea and use land unsuitable for tea for valuable cinchona
production. It would strengthen a vital section of the tea industry and,
by demonstration and provision of a source of good planting material,
serve as a base for improvement in the smallholder and private estate
sector, which would also benefit from project-initiated research.
7.02      The project would maintain employment for some 35,000 tea workers
and improve their earning capacity. It would give employment to about
1,500 workers on cinchona.
7.03      Without the project, the quality of tea would continue to decline
and lack of finance would lead to deficiencies in field and factory with
consequently reduced production. At full production in about 13 years, the
differential increase in annual tea crop with and without the project would
be about 13,000 tons and in annual value of tea production, at world prices,
about US$13M. During the 20-year life of project cinchona new planting, about
1,800 tons of quinine salts would be produced, worth an estimated US$20M.
7.04      In calculating net benefits (Annex 20), wages and salaries are costed
fully. Since tea estates are generally on land with little alternative eco-
nomic use, no opportunity cost is attributed to it. The economic life of the
tea, for rate of return purposes, is taken as 20 years.
7.05      On the above assumptions, the estimated rates of return to the
economy of Indonesia would be:
Percent per Year
PNP XII:           Tea                            25
PNP XII:           Cinchona                       22
PNP XIII:          Tea                            27
Overall Project:  Tea and Cinchona                26
Sensitivity
7.06      Sensitivity of the above rates to produce prices has been tested,
and the result is shown in Annex 20, Table 2. An increase/decrease of 10%
in tea prices would change the rates of return by about five points either
way. Sensitivity to wage rate increase has also been tested. A doubling



- 20 -
of wage rates, without increasing labor productivity, would reduce the
estimated overall rate of return from 26% to 17%.
7.07      Project benefit includes prevention of crop and quality loss that
would occur without the project. If production and quality could be
maintained at present levels without the project, prevention of this loss
could not be included as a benefit. In that event, the overall rate of
return would be 20% instead of 26%.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS -
8.01      While assurances have been obtained that should avoid many problems,
some, such as adverse tea price movements, would be beyond project control
and others would be difficult to provide for. For example, corruption is
alleged to be widespread in the tea industry, as in other sectors of the
Indonesian economy. The appointment of an Inspection Service and Advisors,
open publication of tea prices, and improved procurement methods should
help to reduce the likelihood of misallocation of resources. The expected
benefits of the project would be fully forthcoming only if project management
implements improved practices which the Inspection Service and Advisors would
help to introduce - and which PNP staff, during appraisal, seemed eager to
learn and to adopt.
8.02      During negotiations, discussions were held with Government on ac-
tion to reduce delays and formalities in handling project exports and Imports
(3.06); on the margin of preference to be allowed to local suppliers (4.25);
and on improvement of procurement methods (4.26). Draft PT Charters of In-
corporation were submitted to IDA for approval; and assurances were given
that PT conversion would take place not later than December 31, 1971 (5.04).
8.03      During negotiations, assurances were also obtained, amongst others,
that:
(a)  with the assistance and recommendation of the consultancy
organization, a Five-Year Development Plan, satisfactory
to IDA, would be prepared and implemented (4.04);
(b)  road maintenance equipment would be provided in accordance
with a road works program, satisfactory to IDA, prepared by
the Production Directors with the recommendation of the
consultancy organization (4.14);
(c)  thc Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey would be
carried out under terms of reference and by consultants
acceptable to IDA (4.21);
1/   References in parentheses to previous paragraph numbers.



- 21 -
(d) all appointments to the two Supervisory and Management.
Boards and the appointment of the Chief Accountants, if
any, would be subject to prior consultation with IDA
(5.03);
(e)  an organization satisfactory to IDA, would be engaged to
provide an Inspection Service for an initial period of
about five years, and Advisors for an initial period of
two years, on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA (5.07);
8.04      It would be a condition of effectiveness that a program for regis-
tration of project estate leases on appropriate terms had been agreed with
IDA (3.02).
8.05      It would be a condition of disbursement for each PNP that:
(a)  it had been formed into separate PT, with a Supervisory
Board to lay down policy and a Management Board to
carry it out (5.04);
(b)  Supervisory and Management Board members had been
appointed (5.04);
(c)  subsidiary loan agreements, approved by IDA, had been
signed (4.24); and
(d)  the consultancy organization providing the Inspection
Service and Advisors had been appointed (5.07).
8.06      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$15M to the Govern-
ment of Indonesia.

INDONESIA
TEA PROJECT
The Estate Industry
The Estate Industrv - General
1.        Before World War II, Indonesia had the largest and, in some
respects, the most scientifically advanced estate industry in the tropics.
The productive areas, largely European owned and managed, then totalled
some 1.2 MI ha, accounted for about 8% of the country's cultivated area,
and produced roughly 60% of total exports. Since World War II, the
role of estates in the economy has diminished dramatically; thus in 1964,
estate produce accounted for only 15 - 20% of exports, and the volume of
estate production is now about half what it was pre-war. The decline
is due to a dissipation of scientific, technical and managerial know-how
brought about by nearly 30 years of political, economic and fiscal
instability and, in particular, by the 1957 nationalization of an all
Dutch-owned estates (which now form part of the Government Estate Sector)
and the mandatory management by Government of other foreign-owned estates
in 1964.
2.        A 1966 census showed the estate sector then comprised a planted
area of some 854,000 ha, made up of 531,000 ha rubber (62%); 106,800 ha
oil palms (12%); 76,000 ha sugar (9%); 73,000 ha tea (8%); and 42,700
ha coffee (5%), and the balance in other estate crops such as coconut,
cocoa and cinchona (quinine).  These figures include private Indonesian-
owned estates, about which accurate information is diffictilt to obtain,
but they do give an idea of the size and importance of the sector.
The Government Estate Sector
3.        In 1969, Covernmrnt estates comprised a plantcJ area of about
600,000 ha, made up of about 220,000 ha rubber, 80,000 oil palm, 40,000
tea, 70,000 suigar, 20,000 coffee, 16,000 tobacco, 120,000 pine forest,
ancl lesser areas of cocoa, sisal, manila hemnp, kapok and other crops.
4.        During their I3 years, Governument esLates have been heavily
taxed. I;ntil recently 25%' export duties and 60% corporation taxes were
imposed and there were obligations to contribute to various Governient
funds.  In addition, Covernmuent kept operating and capital expenditures
to the minimum and, throuhl laclk of cash, the estates fe]l behindl in their
maintenance and virtually discontinue.l replanting and expansion programs;
velhicles, processing facilities and houses fell into disrepair. The estates
were also allocated inadequate foreign exchange for essential purchases of
fertilizer and other chemicals.  Hlanagement - particularly financial and
marketing - was over centralized and seriously affected by a hand-to-mouth



ANNEX 1
Page 2
financial existence. The situation was worsened by political appointments
to important posts and by frequent reorganizations and regroupings. (Some
estates have suffered six changes in top management authority in recent
years.) Wage and salary levels were fixed by Government and, in real terms,
fell with rapid inflation to levels which provided no incentive to higher
production and lower costs. Corruption was rife and the military abused
their position.
5.        The reorganization and partial decentralization of Government-
owned estates, which took place in April 1968 and became effective in
1969, were important steps towards rehabilitation of the sector. The
estates were previously arranged in five major crop groups, each centrallv
managed from Djakarta. Now they are grouped into 28 units known as PNP
based on geographical location, crop and size. Each PNP has an Executive
Board of Directors located in its operational area, though many important
powers are reserved to the Minister of Agriculture, including appointment
of senior staff, approval of budget estimates and financial statements,
approval of main lines of operations and authority to give instructions
to the Boards concerning the general discharge of their functions. While
export taxes remain high on many crops, (though there is none on tea),
corporation taxes have been reduced to 45% and PNP in need of funds are
allowed to defer payment of these taxes and the various obligatory appro-
priations. Salaries have recently been revised to more realistic levels
and management is responding to the new direction, though there are still
many weaknesses, especially in financial planning.
6.        A final stage in the conversion to autonomous commercial enter-
prises will be the formation of PNP into corporate bodies. Purusahaan
Perseroan Terbatas (PT), operating under the Commercial Code, each with
a Supervisory Board laying down policy for management to carry out.
Many estates have already been revalued in anticipation of the change,
and shares will be issued to Government in place of the present capital
funds.
7.        The Government-owned tea estates, especially those in Western
Java operated by PNP XIT and XIII (see Map), have been considerably
improved, partly due to the encouragement provided by World Bank interest
during the last two years, including the activity of the Resident Staff
in Indonesia and the Commonwealtlh Develonment Corporation team commissioned
by the Bank in April 1970 to survey the Indonesian tea industry and assist
Government in identifying and preparing a project stuitable for IDA
financing. Rehabilitation has made a promising start, within the limits
of present Indonesian kniowledge of modern tea production; but it cannot
be completed without substantial investment in fertilizer, agrocides,
agricultural and tea processing machinery, vehicles and infrastructure,
much of it needing foreign exchange. Indonesia's isolation from contact
with the latest techniqtues for improving the qualitv and reducing the
cost of tea is also a severe limiting factor.



ANNEX 2

INDONESIA
TEA PROJECT
The Indonesian Tea Industry
Histor
1.        Tea was first planted in Indonesia towards the end of the 19th
century. Planting expanded rapidly during the next half century until, by
the 1930's the Indonesian tea industry was the third largest in the world
and highly rated for quality. Thereafter planted area declined due to
the Depression, World War II, the struggle for Independence and the
subsequent period of economic and political instability lasting until 1966,
when General Suharto's Government took over.
2.        Most of the tea is over 50 years old: much of it was cut back
for food crops during World War II or was abandoned or became overgrown
at other times. In spite of this rough treatment, if it is still growing,
it responds well to improved management and is generally capable of
being brought back into good condition, given a few years of proper
treatment.
Adverse Factors
3.        An impediment to complete recovery is loss of prodtuction from
bushes removed or destroyed for various reasons, i.e. the vacancy rate.
Replacing individual bushes is neither effective nor economic, and so
some area of tea will be permanently lost until it can be included in a more
comprehensive replanting program. The area damaged by root rot is slowly
increasing everywhere, and though corrective measures are known and
practiced to some extent, there is some skepticism about their value.
There is urgent need for research into root rot cause and control in
Indonesia.
4.        Quite a lot of tea, perhaps ten percent, is grown on steep land.
Where the number of bushes per hectare is satisfactory and the ground
cover consequently good, there is little soil erosion, even though the
grade is steep. On the other hand, where there are numerous vacancies,
weeding has to be frequently repeated and very widespread soil erosion
occurs, not in the form of gullies, but in general loss of top-soil.
5.        These adverse factors bring down yield and revenue, which is too
low in some areas to cover the cost of maintenance and plucking. Such
areas should be abandoned as soon as possible, although the importance of
maintaining Indonesia'a tea quota case needs to be borne in mind.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Smallholders
6.        There have been smallholders growing tea in Indonesia from the
early days and they have suffered with, and probably worse than, the rest
of the industry. Estates used to help neighboring smallholders, with
encouragement from Government, by letting them have planting material
and fertilizer on credit, recovering repayments by deduction from the
value of green leaf supplied to the estate factories for processing.
Smallholder standards were then reasonable and leaf quality acceptable.
7.        With changing conditions and the appearance of a green tea
industry, 1/ standards have deteriorated, intercropping has appeared,
production has fallen away and smallholder leaf is now sold almost
entirely to green tea factories.
Green Tea Industry
8.        Green tea has been produced in Indonesia for many years, mostly
for sale on the local market. More recently, exports to Japan and Singapore
have developed, mainly from medium-sized privately-owned estates and
one Government-owned estate, all manufacturing green tea with relatively
modern machinery. Numerous small, family-run village factories buy leaf
from smallholders and produce green tea almost entirely for local sale.
Prices paid to smallholders vary from about Rp 18 to Rp 25/kg compared
with Rp 21/kg regularly offered by Government-owned black tea factories.
Tea Manufacture
9.        Tea factories, like the tea gardens, have a history of initial
development followed by reversal due to war and civil disturbance, during
which many were totally destroyed and abandoned and much machinery was
damaged or removed. An attempt at rehabilitation followed, but was limited
by lack of resources, particularly foreign exchange.
10.       Standards of maintenance and repair in Government tea factories
are generally high and most of their machinery is in good condition as
could be expected, given its history, though much of it old and obsoles-
cent. However, the industry as a whole needs extensive replacement and
renewal of equipment, together with an increase in capacity, particularly
of driers, withering troughs and power units, if quality is to be improved
and production increased.
11.       Orthodox black tea manufacture has been practiced from the
beginning in Indonesia and is particularly suited to the good flavor and
quality of tea that Indonesia can produce. This quality has been suppressed
through poor plucking and inadequate withering, drier operation and capacity
1/   Green tea, unlike black tea, is not fermented before drying and is
easier to make.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
in the recent past. With improved garden techniques and new machinery
supplemented by the Rotorvane process, quality and flavor should rapidly
return.
Conclusion
12.       The Indonesian Tea Industry comprises a basic core of
Government estates run by PNP, pomplemented by a number of private estates,
with similar problems but not quite so well run for the most part, and
by a steadily declining smallholder element, mainly supplying the green
tea market at a low level of production.
13.       The industry has been struggling to bring damaged tea back into
production, in the face of varying vacancy rates, poor ground cover and
consequent heavy commitment to weeding. Where well managed, the tea
generally shows good recovery and the potential for much greater improve-
ment if fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide are properly and fully
applied and general good husbandry prevails.
14.       The prospects for restoration in the estate sector are promising.
The Indonesian climate, particularly in West Java, is almost ideal for tea.
Management is generally receptive to new ideas and, though the latest
methods of fertilizer and herbicide application and latest planting and
manufacturing techniques are not widely known, where they have been tried
they have proved worthwhile.
15.       The attached table gives details of the area of tea on Government-
owned estates. There are also about 23,000 ha of private estates tea and
37,500 owned by smallholders, though very little of the latter is in good
productive order.

TEA PROJECT
PNP XII and XIII Tea Estates
1.        Annexes 1 and 2 deal with the Estate Industry in general
and the Tea Industry in particular. This Annex discusses the PNP
XII and XIII tea estates.
PNP XII
2.        PNP XII comprises 14 tea estates totalling about 25,000 ha,
of which about 12,000 are planted to tea. They are listed in Table 1 and
are marked on the Map. One estate, Tjianten, is not included in the
project because it has never been profitable and seems unlikely to be,
except perhaps with massive changes, beyond the scope of this project.
Eungamelur is included only for cinchona developntnt because it has
little tea remaining (184 ha) and poor factory access.
3.        PNP XII estates are more scattered than those of PNP XIII
and lie generally to the west of Bandung. Altitude ranges from 800
to 1,700 meters, the lower levels producing somewhat poorer quality
but capable of profitable cultivation, especially if yields can be
improved. There is low incidence of frost damage, but some of the
estates experience excessive rainfall (up to 4,700 m/Jyear) and low
recorded sunshine.
s.        XII estates have more vacancies than XIII in the population
of tea bushes, and poorer yields. Some gardens have as much as 50%
vacancies. A somewhat larger percentage of tea needs to be abandoned
because of this, and because of steep slopes, loss of top-soil through
erosion (caused by hand-weeding) and root rot. There is more land
available on XII for new planting, however, and the remaining areas
are expected to show good response to agrocides and fertilizer. A
start was made with weedkillers in 1970 using only Paraquat against
broad-leafed weeds (cf. PNP XIII which started in 1969) but including
the use of Dalapon, a weedklller successful against grasses and
lalang (Imperator cyllndrica).
PNP XIII
5.        PNP XIII comprises 12 tea estates totalling about 16,000 ha,
of which about 10,hOO are planted tn tea. They are listed in Table 2

south of Bandung, and nine are in one large complex, among the
earliest planted and best tea growing areas in Indonesia. Altitude
(with one exception, Papandajan 75O-1,450) ranges from 1,000 to
1,800 meters, which would enable teas of high grown quality to be
produced, once plucking and factory standards are restored.
6.      XIII has few basic problems, with relatively low vacancies,
averaging around 10/15%. Yields are comparatively high on some
estates, above 1,000 kg/he in some cases.  A little isolated frost
damage is experienced but high winds or intenaive rainfall are not
general.
General
7.      Fertilizer had been used earlier but, during the better
part of the 1960's, it was applied erratically and in small amounts,
due to lack of funds, and especially foreign exchange. A fertilizer
program was started again in 1970 but it needs a more coherent and
concentrated approach.
8.      One year in five is said to be low in rainfall in West
Java, and both PNP suffer loss of crop on this account.
9,      Red and black root rot, blister blight, heliopeltis and purple
mites all occur, but would be no worse than in many other tea growing
countries if proper remedial measures were taken. Pests are worse
where estates adjoin badly neglected privately owned tea (estate
or smallholder) particularly in XII. Root rot has in some cases been
checked, mainly on XIII, by isolating infected areas with trenches
and then uprooting and burning the infected bushes in situ.
10.     Plucking is generally poor and needs early study and
improvement. Management on some estates is very good and receptive
to new ideas. In general, however, there are not enough trained
managers and few understand or apply modern methods. Guidance from
experienced planters is badly needed and would be welcomed.
11.    Garden Rehabilitation is discussed in Annex 5; factory conditions
and remedial measures in Annex 9.

TEA PROJECT
Market Prospects and Outlets for Project Tea
1.        This Annex is derived from a paper prepared by the Economics
Department, 1/ updated following recent discussions on an international
tea agreement.
2.        The world tea market is presently characterized by a steady
shifting of country shares, especially in production and exports, but also
in consumption. About 60 percent of the world's tea (excluding the
centrally planned countries) 2/ is now produced in India and Ceylon, a
proportion that has been falling as new producers, mainly in East Africa,
have expanded their tea supplies. Similarly, the aggregate share of
India and Ceylon in the world tea trade declined, while new producers
increased theirs. The main development in consumption has been the
emergence of India in 1970 as the largest national consumer of tea, moving
the United Kingdom into second place.
3.        World tea production increased by 3.3% yearly from the mid-1950's
to 1967-69. Nearly 60% is exported. Export volume has steadily increased
over the past decade at about 1.8% yearly; at the same time, total value
stagnated as a result of thie downward trend in prices. For the years 1967-69
average world tea exports and total export value amounted to about 570,000
metric tons and US$520 million respectively.
4.        The world market price (average for all teas sold at London
auction) declined by 1.9% yearly from 1960=62 to 1967-69. But export
prices for individual countries did not all follow this trend, and there
has been a shifting in price relationships among teas of different origin
(Chart IBRD 5549). Until 1958 all tea prices moved fairly parallel to one
another. Since then, there have been marked divergencies. Indian and
Ceylonese tea prices continued to decline with short interruptions until
1969. These two countries are the largest exporters, and were mainly
responsible for the decline in the average London auction price.
5.        The situation was different for African teas, for which prices
were traditionally below those for Indian and Ceylonese teas - a reflection
of quality differences. Since the late 1950's, the differentials have
1/   "Review of the World Tea Economy", EC No. 174, April 1970.
2/   Only the USSR and Mainland China are major tea producers among centrally
planned countries. Owing to the scarcity of data, they are not consid-
ered in this paper. A rough supply and demand analysis indicates that
their net exports will tnot exceed the 1965-67 level of about 6,000 tons,
1% of world net exports during that period.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
narrowed considerably on the average, mainly because of improvements in
quality and the fact that blenders incorporated a greater share of medium
and CTC 1/ teas (supplied by Africa) in their blends.
6.        Projections indicate that between 1965-67 and 1980, consumption
in importing countries will increase between 1.5% and 1.8% yearly, while
export availabilities are expected to rise between 2.3% and 2.8% yearly.
The excess of exports over imports will exercise constant pressure on world
market prices. Average London auction prices are estimated to fall from
their 1968-69 average of 100.7 US cents/kg to 88.2 US cents/kg by 1975.
7.        A decline below 88.2 US cents/kg is unlikely since some areas
of tea will prove unprofitable at this price, especially in view of probable
cost increases. They will reduce output, thereby establishing equilibrium
between supply and demand. Subsidising tea, to maintain production, would
not be a long run solution since the inelastic demand in importing countries
operates against an increase in consumption in spite of lower prices. Storage
is also not practicable for any length of time, since tea is perishable and
soon deteriorates. After demand and supply equilibrium has been restored,
prices are likely to rise with cost increases.
8.        An international tea agreement is being discussed to achieve an
orderly adjustment of import demand to export supply through ex'port
quotas. So far these discussions have resulted in a short-term agreement
for 1970, extended to cover 1971. Under this agreement Indonesia was
given a yearly export quota of 35,000 metric tons. Past exports have been
below this level (Table 3) except in 1970, when they amounted to about
35,000 tons (preliminary estimate).
9.        Whether a long-term quota system will ever be established is
not clear; but it is fairly certain that it will not be achieved during the
next three or four years. If an agreement can be negotiated, the decline
in world market prices will be halted and prices are likely to settle in
the first instance at about their 1968 level. Thereafter, prices will
probably increase in line with increases in costs of production.
Indonesian tea
10.       Before World War II, Indonesia was the world's third largest
exporter of black tea, selling about 72,000 tons in 1938. During World
War II, large areas of tea were torn up for food production and have
never been replanted. Since then there has been not only a further
decrease in the tea area and a decline in exports to about 33,000 tons
(average for 1960's), but also a severe deterioration in quality and
consequently in prices. In 1968 about 42,700 tons of black tea were
produced, of which 34,700 tons were exported. The rest, which is generally
of the lowest quality, was consumed domestically.
1/ Cut, tear, curl - see Annex 9, para 27.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
11.       The Indonesian tea industry comprises three different sectors:
Government-owned estates organized in PNP, (almost entirely former Dutch
estates); private estates; and smallholders. PNP production is almost
all black tea, most of which is exported. Smallholders produce mainly
green tea, often by primitive methods of home manufacture. Their total
production of black tea is less than 4,000 tons. This tea, which is of
low quality, generally goes into domestic consumption together with about
another 4,000 tons of black tea from PNP and private estates. Private
estates produce black and green tea.
12.       The decline in the Indonesian tea industry affected all sectors.
Though area data are misleading and not very reliable, of the 50,000
ha of smallholder tea in 1968 only about 37,000 ha were productive; and of
this area only 20% is considered to have reasonable stands of tea in
good maintenance.
13.       Only comprehensive rehabilitation can prevent a further decline
in Indonesian tea output and quality, and such rehabilitation is contem-
plated for the two PNP under the project, and for PNP VIII in Sumatra
under a Dutch aid agreement. These three PNP accounted for about 60% of
total black tea production in 1968.
14.       To project future production of Indonesian black tea it was
assumed that private estates, smallholders and PNP, except VIII, XII and
XIII, will not rehabilitate their tea area and their production will
continue to decrease. This implies a decline of about 5,000 tons of black
tea between 1970 and 1980. Under the project, production of the two PNP
would be increased by about 6,000 tons between 1970 and 1980; and under
the Dutch project, production is expected to increase by about another
3,000 tons at the same time. Thus an increase in tea output of 9,000 tons
(from PNP VIII, XII, XIII) due to rehabilitation, would be offset by a
decline of 5,000 tons in other Indonesian tea areas and total output of
black tea is estimated to increase by only around 4,000 tons:

plans have been made.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
15.       Rehabilitation of other sectors of the Indonesian tea industry is
contemplated but so far has not been started. It is, therefore, difficult
to estimate future output from these sectors until more detailed analyses
are available. It would, however, be reasonable to assume that rehabilita-
tion could prevent at least some of the decline in production and consequent-
ly total 1980 output could be higher than forecast.
16.       It is conceivable that all of the 4,000 tons, assuming no rehab-
ilitation, would go for export. In view of potential domestic consumption,
however, this is unlikely. Although most domestic tea consumption in
Indonesia is of green tea, there is a strong potential demand for black
tea. Total black tea consumed is about 8,000 tons, and per capita consump-
tion 68 grains at 1969 population estimates. Distribution difficulties and
norn-availability of black tea so far have prevented dealers from developing
the domestic market. One major tea company is presently contemplating
domestic market promotion and this is likely to succeed. Under the
circumstances, it is not probable that Indonesian exports will increase
materially. The major advantage of the project is that it helps to arrest
the decline in exports and improves tea quality and export earnings.
17.       On the world market, good quality Indonesian tea used to be
roughly comparable to medium Ceylon tea. Before World War II, average
Indonesian tea prices were about 4 US cents/kg below medium Ceylon teas. By
1968 this difference had increased to about 13 US cents/kg. With quality
improvement through rehabilitation, it should be possible to narrow the
differential. After rehabilitation, tea prices are estimated to increase
by about 8 US cents/kg from present levels.
18.       This increase would be achieved through an improvement in the
grade structure. The percentage of top quality grades would be increased,
while at the same time, prices for these grades should improve, because
of better quality through improved harvesting and processing. Table 1
indicates the grade structure before and after the expected rehabilitation.
19.       Apart from changes in grade structure, future price prospects
for Indonesian tea would be affected by the world market situation. The
average price for all teas sold on the London market is expected to
decline by about 12% from its 1968/69 level, assuming no supply adjustment.
20.       Within this framework there are three major price developments
which can be expected for teas from PNP XII and XIII. First, if there is
no project and no quota agreement, average f.o.b. prices for tea from the
two PNP would probably decline from about 68 US cents/kg to 55 US cents/kg.
Eight US cents/kg of this decline may be accounted for by the general
decline in world market prices and 5 US cents/kg by a further deterioration
in quality because of lack of machinery, poor cultivation methods, etc.
21.       Second, with the project, but no quota agreement, the improvement
in quality of tea from the two PNP would counteract the decline of world
market prices. It is estimated that by 1975, average tea prices for PNP XII
and XIII would be slightly above their 1970 prices. Afterwards, they
are expected to increase since the above-mentioned supply and demand



ANNEX 4
Page 5
adjustment, even without a quota system, will operate to increase all
prices for good quality tea. By 1980 a price of 80 US cents/kg is projected.
22.       A third possibility would be the negotiation of an international
tea agreement. In this case, world market prices are likely to be fixed
initially at their 1968 level, and probably will increase after a few
years to account for cost increases. In such a case, prices for the two
PNP would increase by about 8 US cents/kg above the 1968 level, after
completion of the project. Further increases to about 80 US cents/kg or
above by 1975 and 85 US cents/kg by 1985 can be expected if the interna-
tional agreement succeeds in adjusting prices in line with cost increases.
23.       For the project projections, only the first two alternatives have
been considered, though the effect of the third on the estimated rate of
return to the economy has been calculated and is referred to in the report.
All three price assumptions are listed in Table 2.
24.       The major buyers of Indonesian tea are Western Europe, Australia
and the United States, as Table 3 indicates. The Netherlands occupies a
dominant position, but more recently Australia has become of increasing
importance. The prominence of the continental Western European countries
is somewhat misleading. A considerable quantity of this tea is resold
to the United Kingdom and the United States, after sorting and regrading.
Thus in 1968 and 1969, the United States imported about 7,000 tons of
Indonesian tea via Europe in addition to direct exports from Indonesia
listed in Table 3. For the United Kingdom this quantity was about 8,000
tons for the average of the two years. The traditional export structure
is also indicative of future developments. The Netherlands, the United
States, Australia and the United Kingdom will remain the major buyers of
Indonesian tea and would take more if tea quality improved.
25.       Selling policy of all teas produced by PNPs XI, XII and XIII is
broadly guided by BCU/PNP Headquarters in Djakarta. This office also
influences selling prices of other P.NP production in Java and Sumatra.
The tea is sold against the highest bid after taking into account prevailing
tea prices at Colombo and London auctions and consulting various
international publications which comment on tea. More regular contact
with overseas markets is desirable, as well as better price and sales
reporting on an international level. Technical aid in marketing has
been sought from Britain and a marketing advisory officer will be
stationed at BCU Headquarters in Djakarta.
26.       Approximately 85% of PNP tea is sold on an f.o.b. Tanjong
Priok basis against letter of credit. This enables producers to draw
the f.o.b. proceeds in full immediately teas are shipped and since there
are several foreign buyers and local buying agents, there is competition
and this method of selling is satisfactory. The need for funds, however,
has encouraged forward sales. Under this sytem buyers cannot base their
purchases on tea samples, and they usually discount prices to allow for
seasonal variations in quality. Fortunately, this is less of a problem
in Indonesis because of fairly even climatic conditions. But it requires
skilful marketing management which is presently lacking. Thus with an
improvement in the financial situation of the two PNP the forward sales



ANNEX 4
Page 6
policy should be reassessed and the volume of forward f.o.b. sales, if
necessary, reduced.
27.       About 15% is sold at the Antwerp auction.  It has been proved
that prices in Antwerp are usually lower than comparable prices obtained
from direct sales. The relatively low prices in Antwerp can be
explained by the limited market of that auction for re-exports. This
is in contrast to the London auction.
28.       None of the Indonesian tea is sold at the London auction.  This
is because, prior to 1964, a duty of about 4.5 US cents/kg was imposed
on Indonesian tea imports and, since then, the possibilities of the
London market have not been fully explored. Indonesian producers are also
reluctant to delay revenue while tea shipments are forwarded to London for
sampling, and London buyers are reluctant to buy tea until it has been
sampled at destination.
29.       In order to improve competition and, at the same time, facilitate
quick payment, the establishment of a Djakarta auction center has been
discussed. While the possibility warrants close examination, it is
considerably less urgent than agricultural rehabilitation on estates.
As already stated, a substantial volume of tea is sold privately on f.o.b.
terms and further quantities are consigned to final sale at auctions
in Europe. This reduces the volume of unsold tea available for auction
in Djakarta, and it is unlikely that under these circumstances the
important tea buyers could be induced to establish buying officer to admi-
nister their local activities.
30.       It will be difficult to introduce improvements in marketing until
improvements in estate practice and manufacture have been implemented and
buyers have acknowledged that teas originating from PNP XII and XIII
reflect a lasting quality improvement. Basically, the method of direct
sales; should be maintained, but sales opportunities at the Antwerp
auction centers should be reassessed, particularly to see whether generally
higher prices can be obtained at the London auction. If this has been
established, tea should be sent to the London market and only those
grades whicth fetch better prices at Antwerp should be sent there.
31.       A great disadvantage of the export distribution system are the
long delays in harbor due to lack of shipping, unwieldy paper work and
general disorganization. Tea coming from estates is often stored three
weeks in warehouses. In other tea exporting countries storage time is
about a week and often less. Long storage time usii7lly turns the tea
flat because of moisture absorption. This is particularly true in the
hurmid climate prevailing in Djakarta lharbor, and the flatness of tea
shipped from there has been a constant complaint of overseas buyers.
32.       Part of this problem can only be solved with a general improvement
in shipping and port facilities, but every effort has to be made to speed up
harndling and transportation.  To improve the situation tea should be stored,
if space is available, in the cooler climate in the growing area until
shipping time.

TEA PROJECT
Garden Rehabilitation
A. Background
1.        To enable PNP XII and XIII tea estates to compete in world
export markets, a program of rehabilitation of their mature tea is
essential. It had been extensively damaged during wars and civil
disturbances and the estates have been subject to many changes of
management. Until very recently, emphasis was given to maximum production,
with coarse plucking and minimum inputs of weeding maintenance, fertili-
zer and agrocides.
2.        The estates were grouped into the newly formed PNP about
three years ago and, since then, rehabilitation has been influenced by
two conflicting objectives: on the one hand, to keep up production, and
on the other to improve quality and average tea price. Quality and
price depend on field and factory management supported by a proper scale
of inputs; rehabilitation aims to improve management and supply the
inputs. A start has already been made, influenced by advice from UK
experts and by the Bank's Permanent Mission in Djakarta, and results are
beginning to show.
B. Field Husbandry
Labor Organization
3.        A first essential is proper organization of the plucking labor
force to improve its efficiency and methods and, if necessary, to increase
its size so as to produce a high standard of medium plucked tea. The
same applies to the labor force for pruning and general handling of
the tea bush in the field.
Pruning
4.        The pruning program to be adopted has a three/four year cycle,
with pruning at 50 cm above ground. "Tipping" would not be carried out
until a further 20 cm had been gained by the bush, to give plenty of
maintenance leaf. Plucking would start at a further 10 cm; thereafter,
a strict and level plucking table would be maintained by keeping the
plucking round down to 6 to 7 days, or less when conditions warrant.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
The table would rise about 10 cm annually until the pruning year came
round again. One of the objectives of pruning is to obtain maximum ground
coverage through bush growth.
Weeding
5.        Weeding has until recently been entirely by hand.  Because of
neglect, and consequent very hard and constant surface cultivations, the
surface rooting system of the tea has been damaged and on steep unprotected
slopes, large surface soil losses occurred.
6.        Herbicides - such as Paraquat for broad leaved weeds, and some
grasses and the Dalapon type systemic weed killed for creeping grasses -
have recently been developed for controlling weeds in tea.
7.        They have two great advantages of particular interest to
Indonesia:
(a)  hand labor is reduced from 150 to 18 man days/ha;
(b)  plant wastes from dead weeds left on the surface of the
soil from a mulch, thus protecting both top-soil and
surface rootlets of the tea bush. The latter are then
enabled to utilize applied fertilizers such as potash and
phosphate to a far greater extent than previously.
B.        The restoration effect is thus compounded by proper use of
both fertilizer and herbicides to restore health and production in the
bushes. This effect is delayed but cumulative and would reflect in
increased yield over the first three or four years after application.
9.        Both PNP have begun to use herbicides, and will continue to
apply them according to a three year weeding program beginning in 1971.
Provision is made in the project to cover the costs of initial applications
in 1972 and 1973. Thereafter, relatively low regular applications of
herbicide would suffice to maintain control. See Appendix 1 to this
annex for details.
Pests and diseases
10.       The third element in garden rehabilitation is the proper use
of fungicides and pesticides. The important diseases and pests are black
and red root rot, blight, helopelthis and orange mite. Except for the
first, they can be controlled by prompt and correct spraying and dusting;
the project therefore includes provision of additional back-pack sprayers
and dusters, together with the correct chemicals for a three year period.
11.       Root rot is very slow and insidious in its action, killing
about 0.5% or less of bushes each year by infecting the tea roots (it
is a soil fungus). Control is effected by isolating the infected area
by digging trenches and buring infected material. This is costly, and



ANNEX 5
Page 3
proper identification of the disease and the most economical method
of eradication would have a high priority in a tea research program.
Fertilizers
12.       Fertilizers have been used in tea for decades, particularly
nitrogen to obtain maximum leaf production. Established tea has a low
requirement for potash and phosphate due to its efficient and deep rooting
system. However, heavy yielding tea, and tea which has been weakened
by damage to roots and stems, shows a marked response to applications of
these nutrients.
13.       Recent investigations in East Africa have shown that when the
top-soil is mulched with weed material and the subsurface tea rootlets
are undisturbed by hand weeding, tea will show an even more marked
response.
14.       Rates of application depend on the soil type, the health and
productivity of the plant and previous applications. The recent technique
of leaf analysis as a guide to fertilizing rates has been applied to a
very limited extent on both PNP. It takes about 12-18 months of analysis
to arrive at a correct rate of application.
15.       The rehabilitation program would make full use of this technique,
based initially on a service available in Holland, but ultimately on the
central analytical laboratory of RIEC at Bogor and the tea research center
provided for in the project.
16.       Experience suggests, as a general guide, the application of
100-120 kg nitrogen per 1,000 kg made tea, plus some phosphate and potash
in the ratio 5:1:1 nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potash (K). The two
PNP have been aiming to apply fertilizers at this rate, over the last
two years for PNP XIII and the last year for PNP XII. Lack of funds,
especially foreign exchange, has prevented timely and adequate application.
17.       The rehabilitation program includes three years at this
standard rate plus 15% extra to correct nutrient deficiencies arising from
past neglect, at a ratio of 5:2:2. This ratio would later be confirmed
or corrected by leaf analysis.
C. General liusbandry
18.       The four operations, better plucking and pruning, application
of weedicides, of pesticides, and of fertilizers, are intermeshed and inter-
dependent. The rehabilitation program therefore includes them all. An
important addition is technical advice and training so that the PNP can
continue the momentum of improvement and updating techniques of growing tea
in Indonesia.

TEA PROJECT
Garden Rehabilitation - Weedicides
1.        The proper use of weedicides in tea requires initial heavy dosages
to gain control, followed by smaller maintenance applications.
2.        The pruning year in the three/four year pruning cycle is the
period when, with the bulk of the tea bush leaves and twigs removed, control
of weeds and grasses is most essential and most easily done. In subsequent
years, with more bush cover and consequent ground shade, there is less
opportunity for weed growth and only spot coverage by weedicides is
necessary.
3.        The following table illustrates the program proposed, based on a

TEA PROJECT
Garden Rehabilitation - Fungicides and Pesticides
1.        The use of both fungicides and pesticides depends on the extent
and duration of an attack, which in turn is dependent on factors such
as weather, host plant, health, etc.
2.        Application on tea estates is by back-pack snrayers, hand dusters,
and sometimes by tractor-powered dusters when the terrain and road coverage
warrant- normally three man-days per application are necessary.
3.        As an example: the insecticide thioden is applied at a rate of
1kg/ha costing Rp 800/kg with an average of 15 applications per year;
the normal fungicide is 50% active copper applied at 0.75 kg/ha costing
Rp 325/kg with an average 20 applications per year. Labor costs Rp
360/ha per application. The average Year 1 cost/ha/year would therefore be:
Rup iahs
Insecticide           12,000
Labor x 15             5,400
Fungicide              4,900
Labor x 20             7,200
29,500
4.        Provision has been made for one fifth of the area to be treated
annually, thus giving an overall expenditure of Rp 5,900 or US$16/ha
planted.
Sprayers
5.        For general application of pesticides, hand operated back-pack
sprayers have proved best. Five or six are necessary per 100 ha tea.
PNP XII and XIII already own about half their requirements. Provision
is made in the program for the other half at US$30 each. Total number
needed for 22,000 ha is about 1300, therefore 650 new ones would be
purchased at a total cost of $19,500.
6.        The incidence and extent of attacks by pests and diseases are
not widespread in relation to total tea planted. The types of



ANNEX 5
Appendix 2
Page 2
agr-ocides to be used are not of the dangerous persistent type, except
for the occasional use of DDT against the helopelthis mosquito. The
program would not therefore have a harmful effect on the environment.

TEA PROJECT
New Planting - Tea
Planting Material
1.        Until, recentlys it was tea industry practice to maintain tea seed
gardens on most estates to provide seedlings for infilling gaps and for
new planting and replanting.
2.        In Indonesia, no substantial new planting has been undertaken
since the last big planting expansion of the 1930ts.   Recently the
emphasis has been on rehabilitation together with abandonment of uneconomic
gardens.   There are substantial areas on the tea estates, especially
those damaged during World War II, which are proven tea lands but which
have been abandoned for the last 30 years.
Plan_tin Program
3.        It is now recognized policy to replant annually about l-1%
of a planted tea area so that it is continuously being upgraded by con-
version to the latest high-yielding material.   Tea on the project estates
should probably, in time, be replanted at a faster rate because it is
so old. However, since so much land is available for new planting, a
start would be made with this, gradually building up, as management capacity
and labor availability permit, to a rate of 3% per year of the planted area,
a rate which could thereafter be maintained for replanting after uprooting
old tea, if conditions then warranted.
4.        All large trees (over 6"' diameter) would be poisoned 18 - 24  months
before planting and all lesser bush or scrub would be hand-sprayed with
2-4-5 T herbicide once (or twice if re-growth appears).   After 6 to 12
months, land would be cleared by hands plowed by tractor and a green crop
of tephrosia or crotellaria established.   Thereafter, the standard
procedures of lining, hole digging, plaiting, etc.,would be followed.
Green crcp should be left or replanted as an interline between the con-
tours of new tea bushes to provide a micro-climate and mulch from its
loppings.
5.        Attached Table 1 gives the New Planting Program and Table 2 con-
tains a 10 ha new planting model.   In the model, pravision is made for
marginal overheads in the indirect costs/ha for maintaining the tea and
variable costs/kg take care of costs which increase with yield, such as
plucking, transport and manufacture.   Using a price of US$ 0.71/kg
(the estimate for Year 4 and ignoring possible subsequent price increases)
taking a 20 year life (without residual valus) the discounted rate of
return on new planting would be about 22%.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
Vegetative Propagation
6.        The tea industry in most producing countries has been turning
over from the use of plants produced from seed, to the use of plants pro-
duced by vegetative propagaticn (VP) from single mother plants or clones.
VP plants thus produced are extensions of, and genetically identical
with, the mother plant.   Thus when a clone is selected which gives a large
percentage increase in yield, better quality of tea produced etc., all the
plants produced by it fram VP will be exactly similar and the benefits
are transferred undiluted to the new plantings.  With sced, however,
results are variable because the genetic material derived is a mixture from
both parents and changes in composition with each individual seed pro-
duced. Improvements in performance are thus also variable and in sum
total less than VP.
7.        The nursery techniques of VP production are different from, and
somewhat more demanding than. the straiiaht.forward raiwing nf Antadlinas
fromr, seed. Once the correct soil mixture and amount of compaction is
found, however, the prooedure of striking and raising cuttings under
polythene covers is also reasonably straightforward.
8.        A program for the selection and propagation of suitable, disease re-
sistant, high quality and high-yielding clones has been under way in
Indonesia for some years and some dozen suitable clones have been produced
with Kiara 8 and Mialabar II being outstanding.   Yield, disease-resistance
and quality testing has been well started but needs further work.

TEA PROJECT
New Planting - Cinchona
1.        Indonesia has grown cinchona for more than 50 years and, before
World War II, provided 90% of world requirements. In 1940, of 11,000 tons
of bark produced, 4,000 were processed at the Bandung factory, still
operating today, and 7,000 tons were exported. During World War II other
countries, notably Congo (K) expanded production but world output then
declined sharply as synthetic malaricides were developed. World production
is now about 4,000 tons bark, of which about 2,700 tons come from Indonesia.
Interest in quinine, used also for heart ailments, is reviving because
malaria has proved increasingly resistant to the synthetics and new treat-
ments using quinine have developed. Demand is estimated to be rising at
about 5 - 10% per year, but the market is narrow and inelastic and it is
important to avoid overproduction.
2.        An agreement has been entered into between ACF Chemiefarma NV,
Amsterdam (ACF), the Bandung Quinine Factory (BKF) (now Government-owned)
and PNiP XII and XIII, to establish a joint enterprise for the cultivation
of cinchona, its manufacture, and the marketing of finished and part
finished products. ACF undertakes to invest in new plant and equipment
to enable the BKF factory to process bark from 3,000 ha, which the PNP
undertake to have under cinchona in five years; to provide experts to bring
the factory into production and train staff; to market on behalf of BKF
and PNP all products processed from this area; to limit its planned
expansion of cinchona growing elsewhere in the world (to lessen the danger
of future over-supply); and to assist in obtaining the required finance
for the factory from the Dutch Government as a grant, or from other sources.
Ultimately it is planned that the joint enterprise will process all locally
available cinchona bark into the most refined products. The provisional
agreement does not provide for finance of cinchona planting.
3.        The industry has few technical problems.  Quinine salts, the
product sold on the world market, are obtained from cinchona bark, which is
stripped from the trees, ground on the estate, and sent to the factory for
extraction. The BKF factory's main operation is the production and refin-
ing of quinine salts, but it also produces iodine and other pharmaceutical
products.
4.        Cinchona trees used to be clean felled after 20 years' growth,
the bark removed and the ground cleared for replanting if desired. The
latest system is to bud high quinine and quinidene content clones onto
vigorous root stocks and to ratoon the trees every 6 - 7 years, allowing
regrowth to take place.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
5.        Cinchona will generally grow where tea grows, but it does not do
do well below 800 m. Though growtli is slower at higher elevations, in
general, the higher it is grown, thie better the quality. Since it is
lharvested only once in 6 - 7 years, it is suitable for land which would be
good were it is not rather too steep for an intensively cultivated crop
like tea.
6.        Under the project it is proposed to plant 1,108 ha cinchona on
two estates of PNP XII, according to the following program (in hectares):

7.        High yielding clones with good quinine content are available in
Java.  The main clone to be planted would be "Tjibeureum" (80%) with other
recognized clones making up the other 20% of the planted area.
8.        While PNP XIII intends to finance cinchona planting from funds
generated by revenue from existing bearing cinchona, PNP XII seeks finance
for planting out the 1,108 ha at a cost of Rp 0.6 M (US$1,580) per hectare.
9.        The average annual production from PNP XII cinchona is now about
five tons dry bark/ha per cutting, with a quinine salt content of just over
6%. Witli more intensive fertilizing and the use of chemical weed control
in the early years, it is expected to increase yields progressively over
about 10 years, up to eight tons dry bark/ha per cutting with a quinine
sulplhate content of 10%. The following table shows yield forecasts used in
the projections:

PNP XII production is expected to rise from 400 tons of bark in 1973 to
about 1,000 tons in 1979 and to vary between about 1,000 tons and 2,500 tons
thereafter, depending on the cutting cycle.
10.       The project includes additional accommodation for staff and
labor engaged on cinchona production and, on three estates, rehabilitation
and extension of bark drying and grinding facilities. Seven new drying
units, four bark pulverisers, four diesel generating sets, together with
five tractors and three trucks would also be provided (see Table attached).

TEA PROJECT
Tea Manufacture
Introduction
1.        Leaves plucked green from the tea bush are converted into the
relatively stable black tea known to commerce, by a process described in the
following paragraphs. While nothing can be done in the factory to remedy
poor plucking or damage to the tea leaf before it reaches the factory,
poor manufacture can quickly ruin the inherent quality of well plucked and
carefully transported leaf of good origin.
Plucking and Transport
2.        Manufacture of black tea begins when the young tea leaves are
harvested. The terminal bud is removed together with the next two or
three leaves. This shoot is commonly known as "two leaves and a bud". As
soon as the shoot is plucked, the greatest care must be taken to see that
it is not damaged or subjected to too much heat, otherwise pre-fermentation
will take place and the resultant black tea will be weak and of poor quality.
It therefore follows that great care must be taken when plucking and trans-
porting leaf to the factory.
3.        Pluckers carry containers which should be large enough to hold
the leaf collected between weighings. If they are small, there must be
frequent weighings and interim receptacles to hold the leaf until it is
taken to the factory. If they are large, there is a danger leaf will be
crushed and kept too long, so that it generates heat, which spoils it. A
happy medium is usually a container holding 10 - 15 kg.
4.        As soon as possible after weighing, the leaf should be transported
to the factory, usually in trucks or tractors towing trailers. Whichever
means is used, the conveyance should be constructed to carry the maximum
load of leaf without damaging it. Open weave bags laid on racks, or
suspended from hooks, are the most satisfactory and they ensure the leaf
is not bruised on its journey.
Withering
5.        At the factory, leaf is check-weighed and then commonly spread
thinly on banks of. wire or hessian ("tats") and air dried through the
wilting point until reduced to about 50 - 58% of its fresh weight. In the
more efficient trough withering, the loosely packed leaf is dried by passing
warm air through it, supplied by fans. Air flow through the leaf must
be even and leaf packed to the correct depth (about 8 in.) Withering takes



ANNEX 8
Page 2
16 - 20 hours and reduces the water content of fresh shoots, rendering them
nialleable.
6.        In Orthodox manufacture, withered leaf is subjected to a wringing
action in a rolling machine with or without pressure. The objective is to
bring about organic change by rupturing the leaf tissues and inducing
fermentation.
7.        Other methods of rolling are:
(a) CTC (crushing, tearing and curling), in which
the withered leaf is shredded and fragmented between
revolving cutters;
(b) the Mc Tear Rotorvane process which operates on the
pri..clplc t  ul ..i, aaare  o-~
(c) a combination of these two processes.
'.        The Mc Tear Rotorvane is also used very effectively to supplement
Ortlhodox rollers because it squeezes and cuts the larger leaf that has
passed over the sifter after being rolled in the conventional roller.
9.        During the rolling process, leaf is sifted periodically to
separate the tender shots and broken leaf which has had sufficient cell
distortion. The tougher and larger leaves are rolled again or cut up in
the Mc Tear Rotorvane.
10.       Rolling takes up to two hours, but use of the Rotorvane can
reduce this to about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Fennentation
11.       Fermentation is the series of oxidations and condensations
initiated by rolling. The time taken depends on ambient temperature,
condition, and standard of the rolled leaf. Orthodox tea is rolled for up
to two hours and fermentation begins as soon as the cells are ruptured;
consequently Orthodox tea does not lie long in the fermenting trough or
Lravs. Wlith the CTC process, the leaf is cut quickly twice and this only
takes about 15 minutes. CTC leaf therefore ferments in the trough for
approximately two hours. For correct oxidation, a controlled fermenting
unit is desirable, preferably comprising trolleys coupled to a duct, through
which humidified air is blown under pressure.
Firing (Dryi)
12.       Fermentation, is abruptly halted by heat.  Fermented leaf, at the
proper tirne, is therefore exposed to hot air in a drier. Leaf is passed
throui;h the machine on a series of slowly perforated metal trays, falling



ANNEX 8
Page 3
from one level to another into warmer and drier air, until the nearly
completely dry tea is discharged at the drier mouth.
13.       Hot air is forced from the base of the drier at an inlet
temperature of 850 - 100C, and meets the driest tea first, gradually
cooling and absorbing moisture from the successive wetter layers of drying
tea until it meets the fermented leaf as it enters the drying chamber.
On leaving the drier, the exit temperature of the warm air should have
fallen to about 55C.
14.       Drier inlet and exhaust temperatures should be controlled care-
fully to ensure that teas are correctly fired or dried. Adverse character-
istics and taints can otherwise quickly develop. Drying takes from 20 -
30 minutes, depending on the type of drier, degree of wither, and the process
employed. The moisture content of fired tea on discharge should be 2-1/2%
to 3%.
Sorting and Packing
15.       Dried leaf is sorted mechanically into leaf grades acceptable to
the Trade and is packed at a moisture content of 3(+ l)%. Aluminum foil
lined plywood chests are used for transportation.  Tea is hygroscopic and
readily absorbs moisture. At a moisture content of 6% or more it spoils
quickly. As a consequence, care should be taken during transportation
and storage to prevent exposure to water vapor.
16.       Sorting machinery is varied and sometimes cumbersome; and since
much rubbing and sifting is necessary to extract some of the grades, sorting
machinery must be efficient and quick. Modern machinery is much more effi-
cient than that used twenty years, or more ago. Sorting can be speeded up
considerably if tea is processed to near grade size.
Grades
17.       The normal principal grades of orthodox tea are:
(a) BOP (Broken Orange Pekoe)
(b) BOPF (Broken Orange Pekoe Fannings)
(c)  BP (Broken Pekoe)
(d) PF (Pekoe Fannings)
(e) Dust (Dust)
(f) Fngs (Fannings)
(g) BT (Broken Tea)



ANNEX 8
Page 4
Sometimes small percentages of OP (Orange Pekoe) and FBOP (Flowery Broken
Orange Pekoe) are made, but this is a refinement unsuited to Indonesian
teas. BPS (Broken Pekoe Soushung) is a tea made from small balls of leaf
and is popular on the Continent, but no such grade was seen in the
Indoinesian factories.
18.       The grades which command high prices are BOP, BOPF and PF, if
plucking is of a good standard, these three grades should total 75% of all
leaf processed.

TEA PROJECT
Factory Rehabilitation Program
1.        Annex 8 discusses the tea manufacturing process.  This Annex
discusses the shortcomings in PNP XII and XIII factories, including leaf
standards and transportation, tnd the remedies proposed in the factory
rehabilitation program.
Leaf Standards
2.        Generally the standard of leaf in all factories is below the
minimum required for good quality teas. An estimate of the proportion
of good grades,two or three leaves and a bud, was 50%.   An all out
effort should be made to improve this to at least 70% good leaf to total
leaf plucked.
3.        The first essential is to improve the standard of plucking.
Leaf must also be handled carefully and pluckers encouraged to refill
their containers frequently and not press the leaf down.   This would
be more likely if there were more frequent weighings in the field, and
this would be arranged.
Transnoportiiand~ Hanvlina of' Leaf
4.        Most leaf is transported loose in lorries.  PNP XIII uses wire
containers to a limited extent, but the leaf still frequently arrives
danaged.   Spontaneous heating of leaf due to this and to transportation
delays is common, causing pre-fermentation, which spoils tea quality.
5.        Transport of leaf to factories loose in lorries would be dis-
continued. Specially constructed vehicles, such as trailers with racks
or lorries with removable racks, would be used for all leaf transport.
One tractor with three trailers can operate a shuttle service, and with
this method one trailer would always be standing at a leaf weigh-station.
Tractors with trailers would generally be used where additional transport
is needed, except for gardens that are distant from the factories which
serve them.
Withering
6.        In most factories the old fashioned withering "tats" (wire mesh
shelves) are used. Leaf is often spread unevenly on the tats because
they are dark and cannot be properly operated or supervised. A few
factories have troughs, but these are often abused and overloaded.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
7.        All factories would be converted to trough withering and proper
instruction given in their use, to avoid overloading.   The leaf would
not be turned during wither as this damages the leaf cells and starts
fermentation.
Rolling
8.        Rollers, though generally well maintained, are now frequently
overloaded and the machines generate heat.   Leaf turbulence is restricted
with overloading and this also spoils quality.   Machines usually operate
for between eight and ten hours without being cleaned, and bacteria
infection is evident throughout.   All rolling rooms were airless and the
majority were humidified.
9.        Not all existing rollers would be discarded but they would be
used in conjunction with the more modern Rotorvane. Leaf would receive a
conditioning roll in the conventional rollers and then be sifted to remove
thc buds ("tip") ana bmaul particles o. leaf whicn are tender and dt not
need further cell distortion in the Rotorvanes. The bulk would then be
processed once or twice in Rotorvanes and once again in conventional rollers
to ensure that all the leaf has a good "make" - the term used for well
processed leaf.
Fermentation
10.       The small airless rooms used for fermentation are dirty and
have too much water laying about. The leaf is spread on the trays
unevenly and far too thickly.   This does not permit the necessary oxida-
tion.   Bacteria infection is evident in all fermenting rooms.   Only in
one or two factories were hygrometers used to measure the humidity which
was always in the region of 98%.
11.       The current method of fermenting on trays in small rooms is most
unsatisfactory and research has proved that leaf ferments more evenly
when it can oxidize readily.   Cleanliness is also essential and controlled
fermentation unito would be introduced into all factories as they are
renovated.
Dryina or Firing
12.       Many driers are old and do not work efficiently.   All are
grossly ovorloaded and teas are not fired correctly, which gives them a
bitter taste.   The moisture content of teas discharged from the driers
is reported as 4% which is too high; it should not exceed 2%.   There
are practically no effective recording instruments in any factory.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
13.       Modern driers have increased output with low air pressure, fire
the tea well and are more econamical to run.   Some existing driers would
be renovated but many would be replaced in order to improve quality.
Recording instruments would be provided and careful records kept of tempera-
tures and moisture of fired tea.
Sorting and Grading
14.       Dried teas are now sorted in a variety of machines, most with
a very poor output, causing much double handling.   Nearly all grades are
hand sifted after passing through the machines. Sorting rooms always need
more labor than any other department in tea factories; but in PNP XII
and XIII factories it is generally excessive.
15.       With the introduction of more modern machinery in the rolling
room, the sorting and grading of teas would be greatly speeded up and
double handling and crushing would be avoided.   The sorting rooms would
not need extensive alteration but would, where recommended, be equipped
with new sorting machines which are now available with improved output,
able to clean grades quickly.   The sorting rooms would be modernized
and re-equipped in accordance with the recommendation of the Tea Manufac-
turing Advisor.
16.       The number of grades sorted is now 13 to 16 and this should
be reduced to 11, or even 9.
Packine
17.       Packing is quite satisfactory, but no attention is paid to
moisture content of the teas prior to packing.   They are, in all probability,
between 5 and 6% which is far too high.   Teas packed over 4% will rapidly
deteriorate, as was proved by tasting teas from samples packed on the
estates visited.
18.       Factory Staff would be trained to use moisture meters regularly
and teas would not be packed with a moisture content above 3%.
Records and Office
19.       The majority of estates had good records and the flow of leaf
through each department is properly recorded. A great deal of accounting
information is sent back to HQ, but little of it is used, or useable, for
management information and control.
20.       The Advisors to the Commercial Directors would make an early
study of records kept and devise systems for promptly supplying HQ and
estates management with production, accounting and sales information needed
for effective control.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
Power
21.       Power supply is causing concern in nearly all factories.  Those
with hydro or hydro-electric power have to rely on standby plants when water
is low or diverted by Government.   Many of the others, with diesel-electric
sets, are using engines to capacity every day with little or no standby.
The grid is unreliable and power cuts are frequent.   Factories on the grid
work at half throughput during power cuts, because of lack of standby
equipment.
22.       Power plants in some PNP XIII estates would be reorganized.
Other estates are very short of power and a schedule has been drawn up
giving the power requirements for each factory on both PNP and the year in
which it is required (see Annex 10).
Maintenance FActory and Machinerv
23.       Maintenance is of a very satisfactory standard in all factories.
Many machines and vehicles are reaching the end of their useful life but
they are running quite well.
Centralization
24.       Some centralization of processing has already taken place, but
it is unwise to increase any factory annual output beyond 1.5 M kg made
tea.   ithere there is a large factory near an estate with a very poor
factory, closure of the poor factory should be considered instead of
spending large sums to put it right. With this in mind, closure of
Talun factory is proposed, the leaf being processed at nearby Santosa
(see Map), subject to confirmation by Inspection Service engineers.
No provision is therefore made for rehabilitation of the Talun factory
but additional machinery is included for Santosa.
Central Workshops
25.       There is very great need for a Central Workshop, with an
Engineer/Manager and Foremen, in each PNP.   The factory on Pasir Junghuhn
was closed early in 1970 and this building, which would make a very
satisfactory Central Workshop,would be converted for PNP XIII.   Heavy
road making equipment would be stationed there for use on all PNP XIII
estates.
26.       Since this is a new departure for the Indonesian tea estate
industry, a Central Wforkshop would not be established immediately for
PNP XIII, though Goalpara might prove a suitable location if the PNP
XIT   installation proves successful.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
CTC Manufacture
27.       Although it has some advantages of economy and standardization
of output, CTC ( (cut, tear, curl) manufacture is not recommended for
Indonesia because it would require extensive alteration to the factories
and, since it has not been tried there, may not produce a good tea.
Indonesian leaf has the potential for uLseful flavory tea and CTC manufacture
may make it rather plain for the market. There is also a great quantity
of this type of tea already being produced in other countries.
Phasing
28.       Twenty factories in PNP XII and XIII would be rehabilitated
in a phased program based provisionally on plans drawn up by PNP staff
and factory inspection by CDC preparation and IDA appraisal missions. It
is very essential that a firm of tea consultants be engaged to provide
an expert in Tea Manufacture and Factory Construction to undertake a detail-
ed factory by factory survey and draw up substantive plans for factory
rehabilitation on the lines proposed. It would not be possible for the
present PNP staff to do this work, able as they are in their own sphere.

with preference given to rapid improvement in quality of large-scale
production.   Phasing would be brought forward if management capacity
permitted.

TEA PROJECT
Technical Assistance
1.        The proposed tea estate and factory rehabilitation and new
planting on PNP XII and XIII need skilled and experienced advice and guidance
which can best be provided commercially by a well-established organization,
operating internationally, and well acquainted with the most modern techniques
for the production of black tea. To be selected by the PNP and approved
by IDA, this organization would probably itself own tea estates, and be
sufficiently well considered internationally to be controlling and advising
upon others. It would provide an Inspection Service for an initial period
of about five years and Advisors for an initial period of two years.
Inspection Service
2.        The Inspection Service would regularly examine the physical
condition and the operating and technical efficiency of the estates; re-
view progress in the light of policy decisions and budgetary forecasts; and
assist in planning future operations and in preparing budgets. Inspection
teams would visit estates at least twice yearly, and would comprise experts
with skills in field production, nursery works, estate organization, the
efficient use of inputs - such as fertilizers and agrocides - the operation
of tea factories, and the production and grading of quality tea. The teams
would vary in size froo two to four persons, according to the skills re-
quired, and would include a Senior Visiting Agent with experience in all
aspects of tea production, supported as necessary by a key production
engineer and specialists in, for example, accounts, organization, marketing,
vegetative propagation (VP) and research. The Visiting Agent would be
senior to, but would consult with, the Advisors appointed by the organization
as outlined below. Within one month of eaclh visit the team would make a
full report to the Supervisory Board, with copies to the Management Board
and to IDA.
3.        The organization would also provide specialists, including the
Tea Manufacturing Advisor, to survey, design, lay out and advise on the
rehabilitation of, and addition to, tea factories and machinery, having
regard to forecast field production. It would ensure that Indonesian
counterparts were fully involved in the inspection and advisory work.
Advisors
4.        An Advisor would be appointed to each of the PNP Production
Directors and Commlercial Directors and one Tea Manufacturing Advisor would
assist both PNP. The Advisors would be resident in Bandung and would work



ANNEX 11
Page 2
closely with the headquarters and estate management staff, so that their
services would not be permanently required after two years; there would
however be provision for partial extension of their services up to another
three years to the extent agreed between PNP Supervisory Board, the organi-
zation and IDA.
Advisors to the Production Directors
5.        The Advisors to the Production Directors would be responsible to
the respective PNP First Directors, and would:
(a) have at least five years' practical experience in planting
and growing of high-yielding tea and the making of black
tea by Orthodox/Rotorvane methods, preferably in more than
one country ecologically similar to West Java;
(b) regularly visit the estates and advise on all aspects of
tea estate field operation, including clonal selection,
VP and nursery operation (having regard to the work of

replanting; pruning, weeding, leaf analysis and fertilizer
application (based on leaf analysis, when available); pest
and disease control; plucking and leaf transport;
(c) advise on tea estate management organization and the
effective use of labor and, in cooperation with the
Commercial Director and his Advisor, on the keeping of
estate and headquarter records useful for management and
budgetary control, with a view to the cost of all operations
being considered in relation to expected benefits;
(d) assist the Inspection Service to Advise PNP management on
the preparation of a five-year Development Plan for garden
rehabilitation and new planting, make written comments thereon,
and give written opinions on any changes proposed therein;
report to the Production Director on the performance of all
estate managers and recommend termination or suspension of
any that are inefficient or fail to comply with instructions;
(e) assist the Production Director to prepare a training program
for estate management and supervisory staff, and assist in
the carrying out of that program;
(f) make recommendations for, and arrange, overseas training
visits by selected staff, and comment on the suitability
of staff proposed for such training;
(g) cooperate with the Tea Manufacturing Advisor to
ensure that leaf of acceptable quality is delivered to
the factories; and

Advisors to the Commercial Directors
6.        The Advisors to the Commercial Directors would be responsible to
the respective PNP First Director and would:
(a) have at least five years' experience in the financial
control and planning of large tea estate companies, and
be capable of training staff, at all levels, in the proper
keeping and use of production and financial records;
(b) with a view to improving the accounting administration and
financial control of the PNP and, in particular, simplifying
records, study at headquarters and estate level the existing
production and financial records, accounting procedures,
methiods of budgeting and allocating financial resources and
internal and external audit procedures and make recommendations
within six montlhs of their appointment;
(c) urgently consider the staffing of the accounts departments and
recommend whether a chief accountant or similar officer should
be appointed;
(d) assist the Commercial Director in implementation of recom-
mendations accepted by the First Director:

TEA PROJECT
Research in Indonesia
1.        Tea researclh in Indonesia started in 1902 and expanded steadily
until World War II, since when it has made little or no impact on the indus-
try. The Research Institute for Estate Crops (RIEC) became responsible for
tea but spent only Rp 2 million (US$5,300) out of its meager budget of Rp 20
million in 1969.
2.        Tea and cinchona laboratories are based at RIEC headquarters in
Bogor, with a sub-station of 50 ha of tea experiments at Pasir Sarongge and
another for tea and cinchona at Cinchona Penglengan within the PNP XIII com-
plex.
3.        There are five researchers at Bogor working on tea part-time, with
an agronomist and one plant breeder (about to retire) working full-time.
Only the plant breeder stays permanently at the sub-station. Government
policy, endorsed by a Dutch/USA mission, is to centralize all research.
This does not clash with the proposal, supported by the project, for the
establishment of a tea researclh center wholly devoted to tea, because
it would work closely witlh the RIEC Director at Bogor.
4.        The tea research center, with some 300 ha of suitable tea land,
would be established at or near the present Cinchona Penglengan sub-station.
It would be staffed by some of the present tea researclh personnel, but on
a full-time basis. They would be supported, for five years, by two
internationally experienced tea research specialists, financed by the
project, which would also provide funds for essential housing, laboratories
and equipment.  Details of the estimated cost of these facilities are in the
Table attached.
5.        Because of the problems faced by research services since World
War II, Indonesian tea research is some 20 years out of date, and will need
to concentrate on urgent problems.  Among the first priorities would be:
(a)  the initiation of a leaf and soil analysis service to enable
estates accurately to determine fertilizer requirements and
correct deficiencies;
(b)  the selection of hilgI-yielding, good quality clones for
vegetative reproduction;
(c) control of root diseases, particularly black root rot
(Rosellinia);



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(d) pruning, fertilizer and agrocide trials.
6.        The proper dissemination of research information, and the formu-
lation of tea research programs to meet the practical needs of the PNP,
would be assisted by having purely tea research stations within the PNP es-
tate areas and by having PNP representation on the management board and the
research program committee.

TEA PROJECT
Smallholder and Private Eotate Tea Survey
1.        Indonesia's smallholder tea has had a chequered history.  It
used to play an important role with some 66,000 ha planted in 1937.
The planted area is now half this, with even less - only an estimated
7,500 ha - in reasonable productive condition.
2.       MIost of the smallholder leaf is made into green tea in small
local village factories now paying about Rp 18/kg for very poor quality.
A small proportion is taken up by private estates for more efficient
machine produced green or black tea. Some is also taken up by the
black tea factories of PNP XII and XIII, which pay about Rp2l.50/kg
for green leaf of slightly higher quality, though still below medium
plucking standard.
3.        Smallholder field husbandry is generally very poor, with
bad pruning, no bush cover, intercropping (which is bad for tea) and
yields of some 200 kg made tea per hectare.
4.        The smallholder industry is in continuing decline with minimum
inputs, including a minimum of weeding so that virtually the only expense
is plucking (usually with family labors and the grower can make a
profit on a garden that is slowly depreciating because no replacement
or replanting takes place.
5.        Improvement to the existing crop will be difficult or
irripossible, because achievable yields cannot support the cost of weedicides
or fertilizers - there are not enough bushes with the potential for
improvement. Probably only a development program consisting of new
planting with the best VP material plus full inputs with carefully
selected progressive full-time farmers could offer a chance of success.
Such a program could not be based, as in some other countries, on re-
payment of development loans through collection at the factory, because
the crop can find many outlets throughout the green tea industry.
6.        A very careful survey, by experienced personnel having knowledge
of smallholder tea and of smallholdar development generally, would be
essential. This would require about 30 man months, including report
writing, plus a counterpart effort of about 12 man months,to carry out
a grower su :vey. The estimated cost would be US$120,000. Draft Terms
of Reference are attached.

Private Estates
7.        Complementary to the Oovernment-owned large tea estates
there are also a number of large and medium sized estates privately-
owned by Indonesian nationals, foreigners, and companies.  Some of
these are in a somewhat similar condition to the PNP estates, except
that rehabilitation has much further to go, yields are less, and
probably more factory rehabilitation would be required. Many, however,
are in as bad a condition as most of the smallholder tea. They
would all be included in the proposed survey.

Draft Terms of Reference
Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Survey
Background
1.        Tea production and quality in Indonesia have declined since
World War II, as a result of damage and neglect following the Japanese
occupation and subsequent political disturbances.
2.        Both black and green tea are produced.  Black tea is produced
mostly by estates, though some comes from smallholder tea processed in
estate factories. Dry green leaf is produced and processed by small-
holders and small village factories.
3.        Tea estates total some 62 000 ha, of which 39,000 ha are in
Government estates and 23,000 ha in the private sector. The smallholder
sector used to total about 66,000 ha but is now only about half that
size; and even less - perhaps only 7,500 ha - is reasonably productive.
14.       The tea industry of Indonesia was reviewed in June/September
1970 by the Conmmnwealth Development Corporation (CDC), at the request
of the Indonesian Government, under IDA sponsorship. Government asked
IDA to finance a Project for rehabilitation of PNP XII and XIII tea
estates and factories, together with a review of the smallholder and
privately owned tea estates sector, with a view to:
(a) preparing a project for external financing;
(b) assisting the sector to become more productive;
(c) rehabilitating suitable old tea, where practicable;
(d)  planning new planting programs using the latest high-
yielding material and negetative propagation; and
(e) preparing a program for factory improvement and
modernization where this is economic and necessary
following increased production from proposals made in
the survey.
Objectives of Survey
5.        The objectives of the survey would be to:



ANNEX 13
Page     
(a)  assess the present extent of smallholder and private
estates tea in categories of: (i) good tea (above 500 kg/ha);
(ii) medium tea (between 500 and 250 kg/ha); and (iii)
poor tea below 250 kg/ha);
(b) plot the geographical distribution of tea in the sectors,
with a view to designing an improvement program, having
regard to actual and possible location of processing
facilities;
(c) list and plot location of green tea factories;
(d) design and estimate the cost of a possible program of
assistance to both sectors including:
(i) field advisory staff, (ii) training, (iii)
phasing, (iv) annual and total costs, and years of
disbursement; (v) availability of credit and proposals
for providing it to smallholders and private estates,
(vi) nrnnpnce4 ir-'rt-s arid fo e.&uhange cosL3B;
(e) test the following assumptions, and design the program
accordingly: (i) that it would be impossible to secure
repayment of advances by controlling the purchase of
green leaf; (ii) that only the best high yielding tea
would give an economic return on any program of rehabili-
tation; (iii) that a program of new planting with
vegetative propagation would be the most likely principal
item in the program.
Project Identification
6.      If a project can be identified for external financing, sufficient
information should be provided to enable Government and interested
parties to decide whether to proceed with further preparation. Such
information would include:
(a) a general description of the project, the project
area, and the number and location of smallholder plots
and private estates, and the work to be carried out;
Cb) the relationship of the project to the tea industry as
a whole and to the agricultural sector, with comment on
its priority;

(c) phasing of project inplementation;
(d) preliminary estimates of the total and foreign exchange
cost, ahd phasing thereof;
(e) availability of extension and other technical staff
to carry out the project and the constraints such
availability might impose;
(f) an indication of the probable return to the economy from
the project.
Project Preparation
7.      The project would be prepared in the general form contained in
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program "General Outline for Projects to be
Presented for Financing". The following matters would be covered in
the project preparation report, but the list is not exhaustive:
(a) Project Description
(b) Project Cost and Financing
(c) Organization and Management, with Particular Reference to
Relationship with Other Bodies
(d) Production, Marketing, Prices and Financial Results
(e) Benefits and Justification.
8.      Fu.rther details are in pages 5 and 6 of Annex 1 to the CDC
Survey of the Tea Industry of Indonesia of September 1970.
9.      The survey and identification report should be submitted to
the Government of Indonesia and the IBRD ReJident Staff in
Djakarta as soon as possible after completion of the assignment, b%t nol
later than three months after such completion. The report would ijse the
metric system for areas, weights and measures: and monetary amounts
would be expressed in local currency and US dollar equivalents.
Staffing
10.     It is expected that the survey would require:
(a) A coordinator and financial analyst;
(b) A consultant on smallholder production and general
agriculturalist;
(c) A tea estate or tea manufacturing consultant.
11.    The survey is expected to take about 30 man/months.

TEA PROJECT
Tea Production and Phasing
Yield Assumptions
1.        Although tea has been grown in Indonesia since the turn of the
century, yield and production figures are not always obtainable for long
periods. Tables 1 and 2 give yield figures for PNP XII and XIII estates
back to 1959.
2.        Rehabilitation has started on XII and XIII and, although 1969
was a drought year -- which obscures comparison -- there are clear indica-
tions of improvement.  Table 3 shows details of the estimated rate of yield
increase resulting from the proposed program of field and factory rehabili-
tation.  Early increases are estimated to be 50 kg/ha annually.  This is on
the high side, but it is in the early years that the cumulative effect of
a combined weedicide and fertilizer program is felt.
3.        A large increase in 1972 is allowed for because in that year
poor, uneconomic tea, yielding 250 kg or less, is expected to be abandoned.
The yield average for the remainder consequently increases. The Table to
Annex 20 shows expected total annual production.
4I        The abandoned arpa, without inputs such as fertilizer, and with
no weeding, pruning or other maintenance, would still be plucked and should
yield 200 kg/ha in the year of abandonment and perhaps half in the next,
though no yields are allowed for after one year. Table 3 also shows the
probable reduction in yield that would follow if no rehabilitation were
carried out.  It is difficult to forecast what might happen to yields with-
out project implementation; but the lowest assumed yield is 500 kg/ha in
PNP XII, which some estates barely exceed now. Some private estates with
minimal inputs also currently produce around this level. Total estimated
production without the project is shown in the Table to Annex 20.
5.        Table 4 indicates the costs and benefits of plucking one marginal
hectare of tea yielding about 250 kg.

TEA PROJECT
Economic Rates of Return
Yields and Production
1.        Some of the existing tea is old and yields can be expected to
decline somewhat in the 1980's. However, the decline, occurring so late
in the project life, would not materially influence the rate of return.
2.        At the end of the assumed project life, a residual value would
remain because tea continues to yield, perhaps for 50-100 years. Since by
that time, however, a considerable replacement program might have been
undertaken and the residual tea would be of uncertain value, no account has
been taken of residual value in the rate of return calculation for tea (or
for cinchona, which has a shorter life).
3.        Without the project, yields would be certain to decline, and this
has been taken into account in calculating incremental production (see Annex
19, Table 3).
Price Assumptions
4.        Four price assumptions are used.  Assumption 1, used in the pro-
jections, takes account of the quality improvement which would result from
the project but uses prices forecast without an international tea agreement
being reached. Corresponding "without project" prices are assumed to de-
cline gradually as a result of quality deterioration due to faulty process-
ing.
5.        Assumptions 2 and 3 test sensitivity to a price increase and de-
crease of 10%.
6.        Assumption 4, using the maximum tea price expectation with an
international tea agreement, would stabilize world prices at an early stage
of the project life. The following are the price assumptions:

/1   Year 1 of project is assumed to be calendar year 1972.
Incremental Operating Costs
7.         Incremental operating costs comprise:
(a)  incremental direct costs;
(b)  incremental indirect costs;
(c)  replacements; and
(d)  contingencies.
A labor cost adjustment is made as follows: The present wage-rate is as-
sumed to increase by 10% non-compounded in Years 2, 4, and 6. Thereafter,
furrher nominal wage-rate increases are assumed to be offset by gains in
pro,luctivity. This increase is reflected in the labor cost component of the
cst:iLnated operating costs.
8.   (a)  The following estimated direct costs are used as a basis for the
production costs of tea:

In Year 6 and onwards, the corresponding figures, with labor
cost increase, would be 124.0 and 118.0, respectively.
(b) As the project would incur only marginal additional indirect
costs, the following incremental indirect costs are estimated:

(c)  Replacements are averaged out as a constant annual sum for Years
6-20:  Rp 190 M for XII and Rp 200 M for XIII.  The useful life
for the various investment items is assumed to be:
Years
Sprayers, Dusters                   3
Factory Machinery                 10
Vehicles                            5

Office Machinery                  10
Road Machinery                     5
(d)  Contingencies of about 10% are computed on the non-labor elements
of operational costs; additional amounts of contingencies are
added for rounding.
Wage-Rate Sensitivity
9.        To test the effect of a doubling of wages (ignoring any conse-
quential productivity changes), the present Indonesian wage of Rp 120 (US$0.32)
per working day was increased in Assumption 7 as follows:

Research
10.       The entire Indonesian tea industry would benefit from the research
program; 30% of research expenditure ie considered to be directly attribut-
able to the project.
Cinchona
11.       Since the cinchona market is inelastic, price sensitivity is tested
by an increase and decrease of 25%.
12.       Original Year 4 and 5 investment cost of vehicles, machinery,
power and buildings for cinchona, which would be used initially with existing
plantings, is not counted as a cost of project cinchona, which does not come
into production until Year 8. Replacement cost of these items is, however,
charged fully to project cinchona.
General
13.       Labor is fully costed without taking account of general under-
employment since there are alternative employment opportunities in the
project area. No subsidies are given to the Indonesian tea industry and no
taxes are charged, other than a tea cess of Rp 3.0/kg made tea, the effect
of which is negligible.
14.       For these reasons the financial rates of return, excluding taxes
and replanting, would, for all practical purposes, be identical with the
economic rates of return. These are shown on page 2 of the Table attached.
