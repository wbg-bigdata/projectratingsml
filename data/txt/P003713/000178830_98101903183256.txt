&EPORT ALID RECOIO4ENDATION OF THE
PRESIDEIT TO THE EXECUTIVE LIRECTOIRS ON
A PROPOSED DEVEILPKENT CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONIESIA FOR A TEA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$15.0 million
to the Republic of Indonesia for a tea estates rehabilitation and
development project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of Indonesia has asked for a Credit to help
finance the rehabilitation and development of two groups of government-
owned estates in Java. The project was identified and prepared by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which was commissioned by
IDA for this task in April 1970. The project was appraised by an IDA
mission in October/November 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in dashington
from April 12 to 16, 1971. The Borrower was represented by: MIr. A. Muluk
Lubis, Director-General of State Estates; Mr. Saleh Afiff, Chief, Bureau
of Agriculture, National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); Hr. Ojo Adiwinata,
First Director, PNP XII; Mr. Kurnadi Sjarif-Iskandar, First Director,
PUP XIII; Mr. Satar loebis, Senior Assistant to the Director-General of
State Estates; Pr. Ismael Saleh, Chief, Bureau of Legal Affairs, Cabinet
Secretariat; M,1iss Buly Lubis, Director of International Relations, Ministry
of Finance and by Mr. Dahlan Ibrahim, First Secretary, Embassy of Indonesia.
4.        The proposed credit would be the fifteenth IDA Credit to
Indonesia. A brief description of the IDA lending program in Indonesia
for agriculture is contained in paragraph 4 of my Report and Recommendation
on a credit for a seeds project which was distributed on April 29.
5.        The following is a summary statement of Development Credits
to Indonesia to date, with undisbursed balances as of April 30, 1971:

6.        The status of disbursements under these Credits was described
in paragraph 6 of the above-mentioned fieport and Recommendation on the
seeds project.
7.        In the remaining part of the fiscal year, I expect to present
to the EHxecutive Directors credits for a seeds project and for a second
highway project.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.   Borrower:           Republic of Indonesia
Amount:             In various currencies equivalent to US$15 million.
Purpose:            The rehabilitation and development of tea and
cinchona (quinine) production on two groups of
Government-owned estates in Java, together with
a survey of the smallholder and private estate
tea industries and establishment of tea research
facilities.
Amortization:       In 50 years, including a ten-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of one percent from August 15, 1981
through February 15, 1991 ani 1-1/2 percent
from August 15, 1991 through February 15, 2021.
Service Charge:     3/4 of one percent.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:     26 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An Appraisal Report entitled "Tea Project - Indonesia"
(PA-78b) dated May 4, 1971 is attached.
10.       The estates sector is one of Indonesia's largest earners of
foreign exchange but its relative contribution has decreased from 60
percent of total exports by value in 1938 to only 15-20 percent today,
reflecting the deterioration of the estates caused by inadequate
investment in replanting and expansion, and the dissipation of scientific,
technical and managerial knowledge and experience. For more than a
decade, insufficient attention was paid by Government to such matters as
fertilizer application and research, maintenance of processing and
transportation facilities, and estate infra-structure. The estates
were cut off from new developments, and standards of financial management
in particular declined. The present Government is determined to bring
the estate sector back to its former level of efficiency, but large
investments are required for field and factory rehabilitation and for



- 3 -
new planting and replanting, and management must be reorganized and
research facilities improved before this objective can be realized.
11.       The two credits (155-IND and 19h-Ii1D) already made for
agricultural estates in North Sumatra will help the development of oil
palm and rubber, two of the most important crops in the Indonesian economy;
and the proposed project would help the tea sub-sector. The project
would consist of the rehabilitation of about 21,000 ha of existing tea
plantings and new planting of 2,300 ha of tea and 1,100 ha of cinchona,
as well as improvement of transport facilities and labor housing, and
re-equipping, reconstructing and expanding tea factories, on twenty-six
estates in the government-owned PEP XII and PNP XIII estate groups.
Technical assistance would be furnished through a consultancy organization
to strengthen estate management and operation by providing an estate and
factory Inspection Service for at least five years, and resident financial,
agricultural and estate management Advisors for at least two years. They
would help re-establish modern tea cultivation and processing methods.
A tea research center would be established with the assistance of two
tea research specialists. The Credit wjould also finance the training
overseas of key local staff. A survey of the presently run-down and
inefficient smallholdings and private tea estates would be carried out
under the project, with a view to recommending improvements and
formulating rehabilitation projects.
12.       Management of the PhPT's is now vested in a three-man Board of
Directors which has limited powers. Major operational policies,
approval of budgets and the appointment of senior staff are reserved
for the Ministry of Agriculture, which is remote from management,
inexperienced in commercial operation and responsible for too many PNP's
to direct them effectively. Estate earnings are appropriated to
Treasury revenue without regard to investment needs, leaving the
management with little incentive to maximize profits or generate more
income.
13.       The Government has realized these shortcomings and decided in
principle to reincorporate all PINP's as relatively autonomous commercial
companies (PTIs) operating under the Commercial Code, with the Government
investment represented by shares. Each PT would have a policy-making
Supervisory Board and an executive Management Board for day-to-day
management. The Boards would be appointed by the Minister of Finance on
the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture. These institutional
arrangements would meet the need for more commercially-oriented
project enterprises. Agreement was reached with the Government that
the estate enterprises would be converted to PT's and appointments to the
respective Boards made for each estate group, following consultation with the
Association, before any disbursements are made out of the Credit for that
estate group (paragraph 6 of Schedule I to the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
14.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about $25
million, including a foreign exchange component of about $15 million
(approximately 60 percent of the total cost) which would be financed



- 4 -
by the proposed credit. Procurement of goods for the project would be
in accordance with the Association's guidelines. Under a decree of the
IMinister of Finance, all materials, components and finished goods
specifically imported for the project would be exempt from duty. In
order to encourage manufacturing industry in Indonesia, it was agreed
during negotiations that a margin of preference of 15 percent or the
customs duty applicable to non-exempt imports, whichever is less, would
be afforded to local bids for goods manufactured or processed in Indonesia,
where a substantial value is added to such goods. Bids for goods which
are merely assembled in Indonesia without adding any substantial value
would be treated in the same way as foreign bids and would therefore enjoy
no margin of preference.
15.       The Association would disburse against the foreign exchange cost of
imported goods (fertilizer and agricultural chemicals; vehicles, miachinery
and equipment), services (Consultancy Organization, Tea Survey, research
staff and £acilities) and overvseas trainirg (local staff).  Withering
troughs ($2 millJon), are li;;ely to be s-)p].ied by local manufacturers
following internat-.onal competitive bidding, in which case 83 percent
of their cost would be disbursed, representing the ex-factory price
net of Indonesian sales taxes and including about $400,000 of local costs.
The case for local currency financing under IDA credits in Indonesia
has been established on economic grounds in connection wJith previous
credits.  Construction of labour housing in small contracts for the
separate estates, estimated to total $2.2 million but having a small
foreign exch,ange component of $330,000, and a small amount of imported
office equ4ipment estimated to cost 50,000 would be awarded after
local advertisemDrit only, though open to competition from foreign
bidders; it is unlikely that foreign firms not already operating in
Indonesia would participate in such bidding. The Association would
disburse 15 percent of the cost of housing and 83 percent for office
equipment, representing the estimated foreign exchange component.
16.       The Govrernment would on-lend $11.3 million out of the Credit
proceeds to the PNiP s for est-te investmn   undar subsidiary loan
agreements satisfactory to the Association,, The loans would be repayable
in 16 years, inc'.uding 6 yearst grace, at the Govarnment's standard rate
of irnterest, which is crirrently 12 percent oer anrium. The 10Rns
would be repayable to tho Gov brment in rupiahs h;lt there wocud be
provision fDr maIntenance of value in terms of US dollars.   The remaining
investment cost would be met from self-generated funds of the PHPIs.
17.       The proposed project has an overall economic rate of return
of 26 percent. In the next ten years, total output of Indonesian tea
is expected to increase only by about 4,000 tons net, including output
from the project. Due to high potential local demand, it is unilikely
that all of this increased production would enter the world market,
which would therefore be virtually unaffected. Under the short-term
international tea agreement for 1970/71 entered into among the main
producers, Indonesia was allocated an annual export quota of 35,000
metric tons, but except in 1970 exports regularly fell short of this
quota by amounts varying between 300 and 8,000 tons over the last seven



years. Prices, especially for poor quality tea, are expected to decline
in the world market.  A higher price than now obtained is forecast for
project tea because of the improved quality that would result. Indonesia
has been an efficient low cost producer of tea and can be again in the
future. The proposed project would help to reverse the decline in
production and quality, provide a potential source of good planting
material, make available the benefits of research and generally
strengthen the tea industry. At full production in about 13 years, the
project would add about 13,000 tons annually to the tea crop and about
$13 million to the annual value of tea production. It would also maintain
some 35,000 tea workers in employment and improve their earning capacity.
18.       During the 20-year life of new plantations in cinchona under
the project, 1,800 tons of quinine salts would be produced worth an
estimated $20 million in foreign exchange earnings. The project would
also give employment to about 1,500 cinchona wcrkers.
PART IV - LBGAL INSTRMUNTTS AND AUTHORTY
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia and the Association, the Reccrimendation of the Comrittee
referred to in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreement contains the usual
covenants for this type of project.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       A special Economic Report (EAP-22) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on April 16, 1971. This report updates the information
on improvements in the economic situation in Indonesia described in
greater detail in the last full economic report on the position and
prospects of Indonesia (EAP-19a) which was issued on November 27, 1970.
PART VI - C011TUANCE AITH ARTICLES OF AGR.EU:1!T
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RiErCOMMEKJT4_70]
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
