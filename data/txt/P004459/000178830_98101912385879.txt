Government's import substitution policy led to a significant replacement of
imports by domestic production. This was followed by a period of slower
growth until the economy started picking up again in 1972. As a conse-
quence of the 1974 recession industrial growth rates plummetted; the growth
rate of gross value added at constant prices in the manufacturing sector
dropped from 13.9% in 1973 to 4.8%, 3.5% and 5.8% in 1974, 1975 and 1976
respectively.
1.02      The manufacturing sector is the second largest sector in the
economy accounting for 24.6% of GDP in 1976, absorbing about 30% of fixed
investment and contributing 10.9% of the total employment. The mining
sector was stagnant over the period 1973-76, and comprised only 1.4% of GDP
in 1976 mainly because of the low world market price of copper. Several new
mining projects based on chromite, copper, nickel and gold are being undertaken.
These are projected to raise the annual growth rate of the mining sector to
9% over the five years between 1978 and 1982. The construction sector has
grown rapidly in the recent past, with construction GDP doubling between 1974
and 1976. The Government's five-year plan projects construction GDP to
increase further by 60% by 1982.
1.03      Preliminary estimates for the first half of 1977 indicate that
manufacturing output in physical terms grew by 4.7% as against 4.4% during
the same period in 1976. The major growth industries in 1977 were: textiles
and wearing apparel, chemicals, petroleum, base metals, fabricated metal
products and machinery and equipment.

Although manufacturing value added grew by an average annual rate of 6.8% over
the period 1970-1976 the relative sectoral share did not change significantly.
During the first half of the period intermediate goods increased their share
of total value added at the expense of consumer goods, but this trend was soon
reversed. The major growth industries were chemicals and rubber products
(16.5%), beverages and tobacco (9.6%), printing and publishing (9.6%), and
transport equipment (9.6%).
1.05      Export Performance.  After slow growth in the 1960's, manufactured
exports grew rapidly in the early 1970's partly as a result: of several export
promotion measures adopted by the Government. The share of manufactured
exports to total exports grew from 49% in 1973 to 59% by 1976. While tradi-
tional exports such as sugar, coconut products, plywood and veneer faced
slack export demand and low prices, there was a rapid increase in



nontraditional manufactured exports such as garments, handicrafts and
electronic products, which grew at an annual average growth rate of 33% over
the period 1973-77./i
1.06      Ownership Size and Value Added.  The industrial sector is predomi-
nantly privately owned and concentrated in large capital intensive units.
In 1974, organized manufacturing units with over 200 employees represented
only 4% of the total number of registered enterprises but accounted for over
60% of total manufacturing employment and 78% of value added (Annex 4, T-1).
An estimated one million workers operate in unregistered enterprises employing
less than five people.
1.07      Employment Performance.  Except for the last two years, the indus-
trialization process has done little in terms of employment creation.
Between 1960 and 1971, employment in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of
about 2.5%, fell to zero growth between 1971 and 1974 but rose sharply in
1975 (7.6%) and 1976 (8.4%). The greater employment generation in 1975-76
resulted, in part, from the high priority given by the Government to the
development of labor intensive small and medium scale industries./2
1.08      Regional Distribution.  Manufacturing enterprises tend to be
concentrated in Metro-Manila and adjoining provinces. In 1974, Metro-
Manila accounted for 39% of all manufacturing establishments employing
more than 5 people; 59% of total industrial employment; 49% of gross value
added, and 43% of total fixed assets. If adjoining provinces are also
included, these percentages would rise by a further 20-30%. The concentra-
tion of industry in and around Manila has lessened in recent years; 42% of
total BOI projects approved before December 1975 were located in the Metro
Manila area /3 while the comparable figure for 1976 was 32%. DBP lending
has followed the same trend with the share of industrial lending in Manila
decreasing from 35.2% in FY74 to 23.4% in FY77 (para. 4.39).
Industrial Investment
1.09      Capital expenditures in the manufacturing sector in 1975 increased
by 27% reflecting decisions to expand capacity taken in 1973 and 1974. From
1975 onwards, however, the level of new investment declined as a consequence of
the 1974 recession. This was reflected in a drop in new projects registered with
the BOI from 217 in 1974 to 152 in 1975 and 86 in 1976. Simultaneously, the
number of newly registered business organizations fell from 49,367 in 1974 to
31,136 in 1975 and 30,813 in 1976. For a brief period between March and May 1976,

investment expectations rose as the business community perceived signs
of recovery in the U.S. and Japanese economies (based on economic data
released in the first quarter). However, it later became clear that the
World wide recovery would be slower than expected. GrowthL of expenditures
on durable equipment in the manufacturing sector fell to 5% in 1976 (from
27% in 1975) and is not expected to have grown significantly in 1977.
Industrial Sector Issues and Policies
1.10      Development Objectives.  In its five-year plan, the Philippine
Government has set as objectives for industrial growth, employment generation,
increased net foreign exchange earnings and greater self-reliance in commodity
supply. The generation of employment opportunities is probably the highest
priority./l The estimated growth in the labor force over the next decade is
3% p.a., and this means that the economy will have to employ annually almost
500,000 new entrants into the labor force over this period. Because the
agricultural sector is likely to provide fewer new jobs annually than in the
past, the provision of more work opportunities in the manufacturing sector
is crucial. This employment growth can be fostered through developing
further exports of labor-intensive nontraditional manufactures, reviving and
sustaining growth in the labor-intensive modern small and medium-industries
sector, and expanding the domestic production of intermediate goods through
import susbtitution. At the same time as employment generation is pursued,
there is also a need for investment in a few large capital intensive projects
to deepen the industrial structure and to develop further the country's
natural resources. An example of such a project is the planned construction
of a copper smelter to process copper concentrates that are currently
exported.
1.11      Investment Incentives and Employment Creation.  Until recently the
incentive system has favored capital rather than labor intensive technology.
Over the period 1970-1971, 80% of the total estimated amount of tax relief
enjoyed by 301 BOI approved projects was on account of capital-favoring
incentives. These incentives include: exemption from import duties on
imported capital equipment, double depreciation allowances on capital
investment, and the provision of investment funds at low or even negative
real rates of interest. Recently, there have been attempits to counteract
this bias by introducing incentives to encourage labor intensive technology.
A review of the entire incentive framework is currently being undertaken by
the Government.
1.12      Export Potential and Promotional Policies.  Historically, the
export of primary goods has been the major source of foreign exchange for
the Philippines. Manufactured exports (except the traditional agriculture-
based exports), on the other hand, did poorly until 1970 because of an over-
valued exchange rate and protectionist fiscal policies. To encourage
exports the Government established a realistic (flexible) foreign exchange

I.B.R.D. Economic Report, The Philippines: Priorities and Prospects
for Development, June 1976.



-5-
rate, fiscal incentives /1 for export promotion and an export processing
zone. As a consequence, nontraditional manufactured exports grew from a low
$94 million in 1970 to $545 million in 1976.
1.13      To maintain the rapid growth of nontraditional manufactured exports,
credit agencies have been asked to give particular attention to financing
export industries. The Government has also set up an Export Council,
comprising both public and private representatives, to consider other ways
of promoting exports. In addition to these incentives the Government will
have to review its tariff policies if exports are to be further encouraged.
1.14      Import Substitution and Tariff Reform.  The present tariff structure
provides relatively high protection for import substituting consumer goods
industries and little or no assistance to producer goods and export industries.
Hence few intermediate goods and industries have been developed and those
that have often produce low quality output. The Government recognizes the
importance of consistency between the tariff structure and other investment
incentives, for balanced industrial development. Consequently, NEDA has
commissioned a comprehensive study, financed by the Bank,/2 to quantify
the effects of tariffs, quantitative restrictions, and other tax incentives,
and to recommend appropriate policy changes.
1.15      Regional Dispersion of Industry.  As outlined earlier, manufac-
turing activity in the Philippines is heavily concentrated in the Metro-
Manila area and its surrounding provinces. Recently the Government has
undertaken several steps to create conditions for more geographically
balanced growth of industry. These measures have probably contributed to the
increasing dispersal of industry outside Manila as reflected in the figures
given in para. 1.08. However, their exact impact cannot be readily quantified.
1.16      An absolute condition for investments to be directed into desired
locations is the provision of adequate supporting infrastructure and the
availability of qualified labor. Fiscal incentives without such infra-
structure are unlikely to induce many new investments in the outer provinces
and, with such infrastructure, may not be needed to a large extent. The
Government has launched several programs designed to improve the basic infra-
structure in areas outside Manila (such as substantial electricity generation
projects in Mindanao and the Visayas, road construction, and a 10-year
shipping and shipbuilding program). These efforts should be continued and
extended to other types of infrastructure as well as to other regions. To
promote the creation of other areas of industrial concentration away from
Manila, the Government in recent years has put considerable emphasis on
planning and promoting the establishment of industrial estates and export
processing zones in a few selected growth centers. Eight estates are
planned by the Government to be operating or to have feasibility studies
carried out by 1982. There may also be additional privately operated
estates.

Prospects
1.17      The manufacturing sector is estimated to have grown by 4.6% in 1977.
The increase in consumption and investment projected for 1978 is likely to
provide the manufacturing sector with a further impetus. Over the medium-
term the Government will be encouraging labor intensive export industries.
Capital intensive projects will also have to be undertaken to bring about
greater vertical integration and increase the domestic value added in
processing the country's raw materials. According to the recently published
"Five-Year Philippine Development Plan 1978-1982," manufacturing is expected
to grow at an annual rate of 9% over this period. To achieve this target,
investment over the five year period will have to grow by 15.5% p.a. for a
total P 86 billion; approximately 65% of this investment will go to larger
industries. NEDA has projected that nontraditional exports will grow by
26.8% p.a. over the next ten years as compared to a growth rate for total
exports of 18.8%. Industries with significant export potential include
textiles, apparel, leather goods, handicrafts, electronics, chemicals, and
goods manufactured from nickel, copper and aluminum.
2. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES (SMI) SECTOR
The Role of SMI in the Manufacturing Sector
2.01      Cottage Industries.  The latest Annual Survey of Manufacturers
(ASM) /1 covered 10,742 manufacturing establishments in 1974. Most (73%)
establishments surveyed were cottage industries (5-19 workers /2) and
were engaged in food processing, clothing, footwear, furniture and
handicrafts. They employed about 13% of the manufacturing labor force but
contributed only 2.5% to gross value added. However, as the ASM data do not
cover establishments with fewer than five workers the share of cottage
industries in manufacturing employment and value added is likely to be
considerably understated by the above figures. In 1975, 71,000 cottage
industries were registered with the National Cottage Industries Development
/1 ASM is a nationwide sample survey undertaken by the National Census and
Statistical Office (NCSO) in every year except 1967, 1972 and 1975 when
the Census of Establishments was undertaken. The report on 1975 census
of establishments is not yet ready.
/2 The NCSO has classified the size of industrial establishments according
to the number of employees. For purposes of this report establishments
employing 20-99 workers are classified as small industry, those employing
100-199 workers as medium industry, and those employing more than 200
workers as large industry. This classification has been found to corres-
pond fairly well with the "official" classification based on fixed
assets whereby enterprises with assets of P 100,000 to P 1.0 million are
termed as small industries and those with assets of over P 1.0 million to
P 4.0 million as medium industries.



Authority (NACIDA). It is estimated that they provided direct employment
for over 230,000 workers and indirect employment for a further about 890,000
workers. Based on these figures, the share of cottage industries in manufac-
turing employment would rise to about 75%, and in manufacturing value added to
about 8%, or close to the unofficial estimate of 75% and 10% respectively
made in 1973./l
2.02      Size of SMI Sector.  Establishments with more than 20 workers
accounted for 27% of the units covered by the 1974 ASM and these establish-
ments comprise the modern manufacturing sector (Annex 4, T-1). In 1974
small-scale firms accounted for 70% of the total number of firms in the
modern manufacturing sector, 10% of total employment and 10% of value added.
Similarly, small and medium industries together accounted for 84% of modern
manufacturing firms, employed 31% of the labor force and contributed 20% to
gross value added.
2.03      Pattern of SMI Growth.  In the mid-1960s there was a rapid growth
in SMI measured in terms of employment and value added. From 1968-71
the employment and value added generated by small scale industry actually
declined at an average annual rate of 6.5% and 2.7% respectively. During
this period, however, medium-scale industries experienced a modest growth.
From 1971-74 a more balanced growth was achieved between SMI and large
industry resulting in an overall average annual growth rate for the manu-
facturing sector of 7.9% as shown in the following table.

2.04      Regional Distribution of SMI.  Manufacturing activity has always
been concentrated in the Metro-Manila area and the adjoining provinces of
Central and Southern Luzon (para. 1.08). SMI tend to concentrate in or
near urban areas, where they are close to sources of supply of raw materials,
/1 This estimate was made by the ILO employment mission in the report (the
Ranis mission) Sharing in Development: a Program of Employment, Equity
and Growth for the Philippines, (1974).

spare parts and marketing outlets. In 1974 an estimated 70% of SMI estab-
lishments were located in the Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog regions
compared with about 74% in 1971. Unlike SMI, cottage industries tend to be
much more widely dispersed. Based on the results of the 1972 Census of
Establishments, about 41% of cottage industries, by number, accounting for
about 45% of employment and 51% of value added, were located in Central
Luzon and Southern Tagalog regions. Cottage industries are estimated to
employ on average about four contractual workers for each permanent employee
and are thus an important source of off-season employment in the rural
areas. These industries also provide an important source of entrepreneurs
and semiskilled and skilled labor for the development of regional SMIs.
2.05      Role of SMI by Major Industry Groups.  Whereas the modern manufac-
turing sector in terms of employment and value added concentrates on the
production of consumer goods (para. 1.04), the impact of SMI is greatest
in the production of intermediate goods. In 1974, SMI accounted for 40% of
employment generated in the production of intermediate goods and 29% of the
value added; comparable figures for the consumer goods inclustry were 24%
and 13% respectively. The industries in which SMI accounted for over 50% of
employment in 1974 were: furniture, leather products, metal products,
machinery and miscellaneous industries. In addition, SMI accounted for 49%
of employment in the footwear and apparel industry.

2.06      Factor Proportions and Productivity in SMI.  Between 1971 and 1974
SMI have become more labor-intensive relative to large industries.  The
amount of capital employed per unit of labor in small firms (P 11,800 per
worker) was about 45% of that for large firms (P 26,200 per worker) in 1974
compared with 51% in 1971./i The share of SMI contribution to value added
declined slightly between 1971 and 1974 while the manufacturing employment
generated by SMI rose from 27% to 31%. Consequently, the labor productivity

underestimate the real value of inventories; however, the ratios used
give a reasonable estimate of trend between years and the relative
position of the various size groups.

growth in small firms was slower than in the large firms. In 1971 and 1974
SMI had lower average wage rates but a higher percentage of wages to gross
value added than large scale industry. However the share of wages in value
added declined quite sharply for all sizes of industry, owing to a general
increase in the capital-intensity of the manufacturing sector.

2.07      In 1971 it was observed that SMI used capital more efficiently than
large industry; medium sized firms being the most efficient. The situation
has changed with the output/capital ratio of large firms increasing from
1.0 (1971) to 1.5 (1974); small firms from 1.1 to 1.4; and of medium firms
remaining constant at 1.4. The improved capital efficiency of small firms
might indicate that they have tended to develop in areas where they have the
maximum comparative advantage.
Institutional Framework for Assistance to SMI
2.08      A Commission on Small and Medium Industries (CSMI) has been created
in the Department of Industry (DOI) to promote and assist the growth of SMI
and to coordinate the programs of both Government agencies and Government-
supported institutions for assisting small entrepreneurs. Twelve agencies
are currently represented on the CSMI. However, the member agencies continue
to operate under their own budgets which are often subject to other constraints.
This has prevented the CSMI from playing a more active role in program formu-
lation and implementation. In late 1977, the CSMI was attempting to get a



- 11 -
budget allocation for a number of multi-agency programs related to SMI
assistance. The CSMI has emphasized the importance of establishing links
with large industries in order to encourage subcontracting and also the
transfer of technology and management skills.
2.09      Technical Assistance for SMI.  As part of the overall program of
assistance for SMI, various Government agencies have programs to train
entrepreneurs to assist in project development and to provide consultancy
services. The University of the Philippines' Institute for Small-Scale
Industries (UPISSI) has an entrepreneurship development program which focuses
primarily on entrepreneurs in the rural areas. UPISSI is also working with
the Department of Education to introduce entrepreneurial training into the
schools curricula. The Medium and Small Industry Coordinated Action Program
(MASICAP) of the Department of Industry assists small entrepreneurs in
preparing project feasibility studies and applying to financial institutions
for loans. MASICAP currently has 50 field teams (118 staff) operating
throughout the Philippines. Since its establishment in November 1973 and
until June 1977 MASICAP has assisted 3,783 projects of which 3,079 have been
accepted by financial institutions and 1,247 projects had funds disbursed to
them. To provide operational assistance to SMI, the Department of Industry
with the Bank's assistance /1 set up the Small Business Advisory Centers (SBACs).
The SBACs, which were set up in 1975, provide managerial and technical consul-
tancy services to small business enterprises. Twelve SBACs, one in each
administrative region, are to be set up. As of June 1977, nine SBACs had
been established with 45 consultants, and increased by three more by the end
of 1977. As of March 31, 1977, the SBACs had assisted a total of 645 clients
of which 488 were manufacturing establishments. In addition, the Department
of Trade has organized the establishment of Trade Assistance Centers (TACs)
to work in coordination with the SBACs in providing marketing assistance
to small business enterprises. As of June 1977, 12 TACs had been set
up, staffed by 45 marketing coordinators. The Design Center of the Philippines
(DCP) and the Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) also provide marketing-related assist-
ance to SMI for product design and development, storage and distribution.
2.10      Financial Assistance for SMI.  The two major sources of medium- and
long-term credit for SMI in the Philippines are DBP and Industrial Guarantee
and Loan Fund (IGLF), of which DBP is the more important. The volume of term
credit provided by both DBP and IGLF increased substantially in 1975 when the
Banks first loan (No. 1120-PH) for SMI in the Philippines became available.
The organization, operations and lending policies of DBP's SMI lending are
described in the latter part of this report. IGLF, a long-term rediscount and
guarantee fund owned by NEDA but administered by the Central Bank (CB), pro-
vides credit to small industries through a network of intermediary financing
institutions. Priority is given to small businesses which do not possess
sufficient collateral to borrow from other sources. IGLF's approvals amounted
to 50% of DBP's SMI approvals in FY75 and 13% in FY77. This decline in IGLF
operations does not indicate a slackening of demand for credit, but weak-
nesses in IGLF's set up and management which the Government is attempting
to correct. Private Development Banks (PDBs) also provide term funds for
SMI. However, the PDBs' resource shortage leads them to concentrate on loans
/1 Under Loan No. 1120-PH.



- 12 -
to cottage industries. Although loans (over P 50,000) by PDBs to SMI have
grown by 18% per annum over the period 1973-77, this financing covers only a
small fraction of the SMI demand for term credit. Other financial institu-
tions, such as the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP), and Philippine Investments Systems Organization (PISO) which
operate small business programs have now been accredited by IGLF.
2.11      Short-term financing for SMI remains relatively undeveloped.  At
the end of 1974 CB introduced a preferential credit scheme under which
commercial banks and thrift institutions could rediscount up to 80% of
short-term loans to SMI with CB at a preferential rate of interest (5%) for
onlending to SMI at 12%. However, use of this facility has been limited,
because of the commercial banks' requiring first mortgages on real estate
collateral. Most SMI borrowers have already mortgaged their collateral
to the term lending institution. Moreover the commercial banks tend to
prefer to deal with larger clients. As the availability of short-term
credit for working capital is particularly important for SMI enterprises, CB
is undertaking a study to devise ways to induce the commercial banking
sector to lend for SMI. Meanwhile, DBP and IGLF have increased their
working capital finance to both new and existing clients.
2.12      Other Programs of Assistance for SMI.  As part of its work program
for 1977 the CSMI undertook several promotional programs through its
member agencies. These included a collective marketing scheme by the Depart-
ment of Trade to enable SMI to take advantage of economies of scale in
marketing and distribution, a subcontracting promotion program by DOI
and an industrial estate development program by NEDA. In line with its
increased business orientation the CSMI has initiated two programs to encou-
rage more private sector involvement in SMI development. One program is
aimed at encouraging successful Manila-based business groups to invest equity
and technical resources in rural SMI projects, while the other plans to find
experts in management and industry to volunteer to assist SMI as sponsor-
advisers.
2.13      Research on the SMI Sector.  One of the projects for which the
CSMI is trying to obtain budget funds (para. 2.08) is a naLtional study on
Philippine SMI. Phase I of the study, which is based on existing sources of
data, has already been completed. Phase II, which will be the substantive
part of the study and will be based on a nationwide survey, has been delayed
owing to insufficient resources. This study, which will be the first
in-depth study of the SMI sector since the ILO mission of 1973, will form
the basis for SMI policy formulation. The Bank is planning to undertake a
study of small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in the Philippines in 1978 as part of
a research project on the role of SSEs in improving employment and earnings
opportunities in urban and rural areas in developing countries.
Prospects for SMI
2.14      The data available from the Annual Survey of Manufactures permit
an analysis of the performance of the SMI sector to be undertaken only



- 13 -
up to 1974. As the Government's program of assistance for SMI started in
1974 and began to have an impact in 1975 it would not be reflected in
available data. However, one indicator of the success of the program is
the rapid increase in DBP's lending for SMI projects in FY75 through FY77
(para. 4.41) and to some extent in IGLF's lending (para. 2.10). Judging
from the types of SMI projects financed by DBP and IGLF during the 1975-77
period, SMI are playing an increasingly important role in consumer goods
industries (especially food processing) serving localized markets. The
export performance of SMI particularly in goods such as footwear, garments,
furniture and handicrafts has been disappointing. The program of the
Department of Trade started somewhat later than the other components of the
Government's program, and has been less effective in stimulating SMI exports.
The TACs have concentrated their efforts on improving the market acceptability
of SMI in domestic markets, particularly in the high-density urban areas of
Metro-Manila and Cebu. But given the increasing emphasis on exports of
nontraditional goods, the TACs are likely to move to encourage exports.
The provision of adequate infrastructure and support services for SMI has
proceeded less rapidly than other components of the SMI assistance program.
The costs to SMI in the regions arising from power shortages, inadequacy of
repair and maintenance services, delays in obtaining financial assistance,
and problems in communicating with suppliers and receiving orders appear
substantial though unquantifiable. The NEDA program to develop industrial
estates for SMI is aimed at addressing these infrastructure problems. With
regard to the distortions resulting from (the Government's) industrial
incentives and protection policy, the CSMI is initiating a study of measures
which might be introduced to reduce the inequity between large industries
and SMI.
2.15      On balance, the Government's assistance program is having the
desired effect of directing SMI into areas in which they have a comparative
advantage. The future prospects for SMI appear to be good given the
improved policy and institutional framework which now discriminates less
against them.
3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Overview
3.01      The Philippines has a relatively well developed financial system.
The core of the system is the large commercial banking sector comprising
both local and foreign banks. Long-term finance is provided principally by
two development finance institutions although several other types of insti-
tutions also provide this type of financing to a limited extent. In late
1976 Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) were established and the Government
relaxed some of the regulations regarding Foreign Currency Deposit Units
(FCDUs). Although three stock exchanges exist, the volume traded is small
and is concentrated in a few issues. The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)
was revitalized by the Government in 1973 to help implement the agrarian
reform program. The Government has also played a major role in the develop-
ment of the rural banking system.



- 14 -
Profile of Financial Institutions
3.02      Commercial Banks.  As of December 31, 1976, the commercial banking
sector comprised 25 privately owned domestic banks, 2 Goverrment-owned banks
and 4 foreign banks. Over the last five years the assets of the commercial
banking sector have increased fourfold. The Government-owned Philippine
National Bank (PNB) is the largest commercial bank and accounted for over 36%
of the banking system's total assets in 1976. The commercial banks provide
industry with working capital and trade credits: domestic credit provided by
commercial banks during the first six months of 1977 amounted to P 40 billion.
3.03      Development Finance Institutions.  The Government-owned Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the privately owned Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) are the major providers of long-term
finance. As of June 1977, the total assets of DBP and PDCP were P 14.3 bil-
lion and P 857 million respectively.
3.04      DBP's funds come from equity contributions by the Government,
borrowings from CB, foreign exchange borrowings guaranteed by the Government,
deposits primarily from the Government, internal cash generation and the sale
of DBP bonds. In general, DBP securities carry low rates of interest.
However, special features such as tax exemption and eligibility for reserve
requirements enable them to compete with other securities.
3.05      Although PDCP is defined as an investment bank under Philippine
law, its main business is the provision of long-term loans which accounted
for 81% of its total assets as of June 30, 1977. In addition, PDCP makes
equity investments, provides guarantees, goes in for underwriting, placement
of equity and debt instruments and loan syndication. PDCP's operations are
mainly geared towards assisting private manufacturing enterprises. Loans
from the Bank /1 and ADB (88%) and equity contributions (8%) are the major
sources of PDCP's funds.
3.06      The Philippine Investments Systems Organization (PISO) is a
privately owned development bank established in 1973. PISO's shares are
held by domestic investors (66%) and the Private Investment Corporation for
Asia (34%). Until recently PISO was engaged in short-term money market
operations, loan syndication and underwriting. However, if the proposed
Bank loan ($15 million) is made, PISO will also be providing long-term
finance.
3.07      Private Development Banks (PDBs).  The 34 PDBs have been promoted
by DBP (para. 4.44) in various regions to engage in the mobilization and
allocation of long-term resources for small local ventures. As of December 31,
1976, the total assets of PDBs amounted to about P 476 million with a savings
and time deposit base of P 271 million. As a proportion of total lending
/1 The Bank has to date made five loans to PDCP aggregating $125 million.



-15 -
amounting to P 174 million, agricultural loans accounted for about 43%,
industrial loans for 33%, miscellaneous loans /1 for 24%.
3.08      Rural Banks.  Rural banks are unit banks which are municipality-
specific and provide short-term loans primarily to agriculture. The rural
banking system comprises around 800 privately owned banks. At the end of
1976 their total assets and deposits amounted to P 3 billion and P 850 million
respectively. Of the loans made in 1976 by rural banks 93% were for agricul-
ture, most of which were seasonal production credits. The Government has
actively encouraged the growth of rural banks by providing equity contributions,
loans and technical assistance from CB, tax exemptions and special rediscount-
ing schemes. As a result, the assets of rural banks have increased four-fold
over the past five years.
3.09      Investment Houses.  As of 1976 there were 12 licensed investment
houses each with a minimum paid-in capital of P 20 million. Most of the
investment houses are linked to major international financial institutions
and large local commercial banks. Currently about 80% of their revenues accrue
from money market operations with only a small proportion coming from secur-
ity trading or the provision of merchant banking services.
3.10      Finance Companies.  The Securities Exchange Commission has
194 finance companies registered with it. Of these, the 42 largest account
for 80% of the turnover. At the end of 1976, the finance companies had a
capital base of P 713 million while assets and loans outstanding amounted to
P 4.6 billion and P 3.6 billion respectively. Most of the finance companies
are subsidiaries of major commercial banks and are engaged in financing the
purchase of consumer durables, providing short and medium-term credit to
local manufacturers and traders and in financing inventory, receivables and
transport equipment.
3.11      Other Institutions.  The 10 Savings Banks and 200 Savings and Loan
Associations together control less than 2% of financial assets.
Financial Markets
3.12      The Money Market.  The money market provides the mechanism through
which commercal banks and corporations keep their liquidity position in
balance. There are basically three sub-markets: (a) government securities;
(b) interbank and (c) inter-company. The government securities market is
the principal segment, with the Government being the largest trader. The
main securities traded are short-term Treasury Bills, medium-term Central
Bank Certificates of Indebtedness (CBCI's) and Treasury Notes, and long-term
Bonds issued by DBP. While direct trading in Treasury Bills is heavy,
trading in longer term securities is mainly "indirect," i.e., the securities
/L Includes loans for commercial working capital, personal consumption,
and real estate.



- 16 -
themelves are not traded, they serve as collateral for "repurchase" agreements.
Participation in the intercompany market is restricted to firms with prime
credit ratings.
3.13       Until January 1976, money market rates were not subject to the
statutory ceilings imposed on bank deposits. Hence there was a rapid growth
in deposit substitutes at the expense of traditional bank deposits. In an
attempt to mobilize savings through the banking institutions, the CB
raised the interest rate on savings and time deposits and regulated
yields on money market instruments. Simultaneously, the minimum denomination
of deposit substitutes was raised from P 50,000 to P 200,000 for instruments
with less than two years maturity and P 100,000 for instruments with longer
maturities. In June 1977, a withholding tax of 35% on interest paid on
short-term financial instruments and 15% on savings and time deposits
was introduced.
3.14       The Securities Market.  An important and obvious gap in the private
financial system is the absence of an active equity market which results in
little capital expansion being financed through the Stock Exchange. A supply
constraint appears to exist in the case of equity issues as private owners
are unwilling to share control over their enterprises. In 1977, a 5%
development tax was levied on closely held corporations to encourage dilution
of ownership. However, the tax may not be a sufficient i ncentive for firms
to "go public" and other measures may have to be considered to strengthen the
stock markets.
Recent Developments
3.15       Interest Rate Reform.  Until January 1976, the interest rates
charged by the banking system were governed by the Usury Laws which allowed
a maximum nominal rate of 12% p.a. for loans secured by real estate mortages
and 14% p.a. for unsecured loans. As the discounting of interest due for
up to a maximum of a year was usually applied, the banks in fact realized
an effective yield of 13.6% and 16.3% depending on the security offered.
In addition, the CB allowed financial institutions to charge service
fees ranging from 0.75% p.a. to 2% p.a. on a graduated scale. In 1974,
in response to tight money market conditions, interest rates on savings and
time deposits which ranged from 5-9.5% p.a. were increased to 6% and
11.5% p.a. In spite of the increase in the nominal rate of interest, the
real rate of interest continued to be negative. While the banking sector was
subject to the regulations referred to in para. 3.16, the same was not true of
the non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI). The weighted average rates
paid to investors on comparable money market instruments were often twice as
high or higher during 1974-75. As a result, there was a considerable flow of
funds from deposits to deposit substitutes issued by both banks and NBFIs.
3.16       At the beginning of 1976, the CB enacted a series of changes in
interest rates and reserve requirements aimed at both the banking sector and
NBFIs. Maximum deposit rates were increased and, for the first time, a
distinction was made between short and long-term lending rates. The
major changes enacted were: (a) ceilings on loans with maturities of more



- 17 -
than 2 years were raised to 19% p.a.; (b) secured and unsecured loans of
less than 2 years continued to have a ceiling of 12% and 14% p.a. respectively
although a service charge of 2-3% p.a. could be added; (c) the maximum
yield on money market instruments with maturities of up to 2 years, including
all charges, was set at 17% p.a.; and (d) all ceilings on yields of instru-
ments with maturities of over 2 years were removed.
3.17      In December 1977 further interest rate legislation was introduced.
The major changes were: (a) the imposition of an effective interest rate
ceiling, exclusive of bank charges, of 12% and 14% p.a. for secured and
unsecured loans with maturities of under 2 years; (b) the imposition of an
effective interest rate ceiling, inclusive of bank charges, of 19% for loans
with maturities exceeding two years; and (c) a reduction of the effective
maximum yield, inclusive of the 35% transaction tax and bank charges, from
17% to 16% on deposit substitutes with a maturity of two years or less, with
a further reduction in the yield to 15% effective July 1, 1978.
3.18      As a consequence of the above legislation, the yield on deposit
substitutes has been brought more in line with that of traditional bank
deposits. This may result in a shift of resources from non-banking financial
institutions to the banking sector. In addition, there has been an attempt
to encourage investment by reducing the cost of borrowing. While the cost
of borrowing has been reduced there has been no corresponding adjustment in
the deposit rates paid. Consequently, the commercial banks will now be
operating on smaller spreads. The Government claims that the reduction in
spreads will compel the banking sector to be more competitive.
3.19      Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) and Foreign Currency Deposit Units
(FCDUs). A significant development in the Philippine banking system was the
establishment of offshore banking facilities in September 1976. The purpose
was to develop Metro-Manila as a regional financial center. Presidential
Decree No. 1034 authorizes a branch, subsidiary or affiliate of a foreign
banking corporation to conduct banking transactions in foreign currencies
involving the receipt of funds, primarily from external sources, and the
subsequent utilization of these resources for undertakings inside or outside
the country. The directly participating foreign banking institutions are
referred to as OBUs. As of October 31, 1977, the CB had approved of
16 foreign banks operating as OBUs in the country. While offshore transac-
tions are subject to few restrictions, offshore to onshore transactions have
to be licensed by CB.
3.20      A FCDU is defined as an accounting unit or department in a local
bank or in the local branch of a foreign bank authorized to operate under
the expanded foreign currency deposit system. As of October 31, 1977, four
branches of foreign banks and 13 domestic commercial banks had been author-
ized to operate as FCDUs. While performing similar functions some crucial
differences exist between OBUs and FCDUs. First, FCDUs may enter into
foreign currency-peso swap transactions with CB which OBUs are not permitted
to do. Second, FCDUs are subject to a 100% foreign currency cover requirement
which is not the case with OBUs.
3.21      Mortgage Banking.  While some form of home mortgage lending is
provided by most existing private financial institutions, there is an absence



- 18 -
of specialized private sector housing intermediaries. Savings and mortgage
banks which were to perform this function are unable to do so owing to their
limited capacity to mobilize savings. This has resulted in relatively small
annual home mortgage flows and little liberalization of mortgage lending
terms. The establishment of a mortgage bank which would mobilize resources
for mortgage loans through the issuance of long-term mortgage bonds has long
been advocated. Although the Government has recently responded by establish-
ing the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation, little is currently
known about its role in resource mobilization or the precise scope of its
operations.
Financial Sector Issues
3.22      Aggregate savings performance in the Philippines has improved
generally during the last decade and is comparable to that of other countries
at a similar stage of economic development. Since 1975, gross domestic
savings have been at a level of 25% of GNP and financed approximately 80% of
total investment. However, in order to reach a gross investment level of
more than 31% of GNP by 1982 and reduce the country's dependence on foreign
savings, the Five Year Development Plan (1978-82) calls for an increase in
gross domestic savings to a level of more than 28% of GNP at the end of the
Plan period. To achieve this objective, the savings of the household
sector, which is expected to contribute approximately 40% of the total
domestic savings requirement, will need to increase by more than 17%
per annum during the next five years.
3.23      In addition to raising the level of savings, there is also a need
to increase the maturity of financial assets. While the gross acquisition of
financial assets by the private sector rose from approximately 7% of GDP in
1965 to over 12% in 1974, the relative share of short-term assets increased
from only 17% to more than 40% during the same period. This was mainly due
to statutory limits on deposit rates of credit institutions while no ceilings
existed for money market rates. Given the long-term finance needs of the
investment program, the present preference for financial assets with shorter
maturities represents an important issue for the Government's financial
policy. With a view to lengthening the average maturity of financial instru-
ments and to encouraging the mobilization of savings through banking institu-
tions, a series of measures have been taken (paras. 3.16 and 3.17). These
measures have resulted in a 36% increase in real terms in savings and time
deposits in 1977. However, a 19% ceiling on loans and debt instruments with
a maturity of over two years still effectively limits the rate on long-term
deposits.
3.24      The Philippine financial system has not yet developed an effective
stocks/bonds market mainly because longer term interest rates have been
statutorily controlled. An additional constraint is the dominance of the
term market by Government financial institutions because of the preferential
treatment given to their debt instruments. Only very limited capital expansion
is being financed through the stock exchange partly due to the fact that
private owners are reluctant to share control over their enterprises and
prefer financing through borrowing.  Recently, however, a 5% development tax
was introduced on closely held corporations to encourage them to go public.

3.25      Financial institutions and credit programs in the Philippines have
experienced deterioration of loan recovery rates during recent years which
has seriously affected their financial performance. This is due in part to
the rapid expansion of credit programs to the productive sectors and to
international economic conditions which have had adverse effect on some
domestic enterprises. The Government is devoting increased attention to the
problem of arrears, so that loan recovery can be expected to improve.
3.26      The Bank attaches considerable importance to a systematic long-term
plan to develop the Philippine financial sector along rational lines. An
aide-memoire focusing on the issues relating to the Philippine financial
sector is being prepared which would form the basis of the Bank's continuing
dialogue with the Government of the Philippines on financial sector issues.
4. THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES (DBP)
A. Institutional Aspects
Legal Framework and Ownership
4.01      Charter and Ownership.  DBP was set up in 1958 under Republic Act
No. 2081 (RA 2081) as an autonomous Government-owned development bank with a
mandate to supply credit for reconstruction and for the development of the
agricultural and industrial /1 sectors. In 1964 it was also given the
responsibility for assisting in the establishment of smaller PDBs throughout
the Philippines. DBP's authorized capital is P 3.0 billion of which P 2.6 bil-
lion was paid in as of October 1, 1977. PD No. 811 issued in 1975 calls
for its authorized capital of P 3.0 billion to be fully subscribed by
1981.
4.02      Board of Governors.  Under its Charter (RA 2081) the overall control
and direction of DBP rests with a Board of Governors comprising nine
members, appointed by the President of the Philippines. RA 2081 requires five
board members including the Chairman and the chief executive officer, to
constitute DBP's top management team. In FY77, two new board members, one
full-time and one part-time, were appointed, raising the Board membership to
the full statutory strength of nine as shown in Annex 1. The present Board
includes the Secretary of Industry and the Special Assistant to the President
for Economic Affairs. The Board meets weekly and besides directing the
general affairs of DBP approves all new investment commitments exceeding
P 150,000.
Organization, Management and Staff
4.03      Organization.  DBP's present organization (Annex 4, C-1) consists
of Head Office at Manila and a network of branches (Map No. 13448). At Head
/1   Industrial sector here is broadly defined to include manufacturing,
transportation, tourism, public utilities and professional
services.



- 20 -
Office the operating departments are divided into four groups each headed by
one supervising Governor. A fifth group of central support departments is
under the direct control of the Chairman. In addition three other offices,
Legal, Audit and the Civil Service, are linked loosely to the organization
although these offices are under the jurisdictional control of respec-
tive independent bodies, i.e. Department of Justice, Commission on Audit
(COA) and the Civil Service Commission. In the past two years a number
of organizational changes were made to handle more efficiently the growing
volume and complexities of DBP's operations. The most significant of
these changes was the creation of two new departments, Agriculture Plans and
Programs Department (APPD) for identifying, developing and monitoring DBP's
agricultural financing programs; and Control and Planning Department (CPD) to
strengthen further DBP's financial control, operational and financial
pl4nning and information system. These organizational changes have yielded
naciceable improvement in the functioning of departments and in interdepart-
mental coordination.
4.04      Organization for Industrial Lending.  DBP's industrial lending and
guarantee operations are handled by three Industrial Projects Departments
(IPD I, II, and III). IPD I and II handle essentially loans to the manufac-
turing sector, with IPD I handling large industry loans (above P 3.0 million)
and IPD II dealing specifically with home industry (cottage industry) and SMI
loans. IPD III concentrates on the financing of transportation, tourism,
public utilities and industrial services sectors. All these three depart-
ments are known to the Bank as they have been used as conduits for two
DFC loans (IPD I), two SMI loans (IPD II) and a shipping loan (IPD III).
The proposed loan will be handled by IPD I (large industry component) and IPD
II (SMI component). In addition, DBP branches will also process SMI projects
under the loan although the overall responsibility for the implementation of
the SMI component of the loan will rest with IPD II.
4.05      The organization of IPD I has remained more or less unchanged
since 1973. An understanding has been reached between the Bank and DBP
to the effect that the Project Supervision Group (PSG) which carries the dual
responsibility of project supervision and accounts servicing (disbursements
and billing) will be split into two separate groups, one each for these
functions; at present most of the staff time is taken by accounts servicing
(para. 4.18). In the past two years a number of organizational changes have
been made in the set-up of IPD II. The latest reorganization effected in
August 1977 resulted in the setting up of three Project Evaluation Groups
(PEGs), each responsible for evaluating projects of specific industry
groups./l Besides leading to greater efficiency resulting from industry
specialization in PEGs, the new organization provides enhanced flexibility
to IPD II in handling the branch cases./2 Subsequently, in November 1977,
/1 This reorganization incorporated almost exactly the recommendation of the
Bank made at the time of the appraisal of the first SMI project in 1975
(Loan No. 1120-PH).
/2 Prior to the August 1977 reorganization, all branch cases involving DBP
loans of over P 150,000 were handled by one PEG which was also respon-
sible for processing all applications received in Head Office for loans
up to P 150,000.



- 21 -
the loan implementation function was transferred from the PSG to the PEGs to
have more efficient loan disbursement and to release manpower in PSG for
substantive project supervision work. In addition, DBP has agreed to set up
a separate unit in the PSG to monitor the supervision of SMI projects in the
Branches; up to now IPD II has not been given any direct role in improving
the quality of Branch supervision of SMI projects. During negotiations DBP's
plans to enlarge the scope of functions of the Industry Promotion Group (IPG)
in IPD II were reviewed and found satisfactory. DBP has planned to assign to
IPG responsibility and adequate manpower to undertake such broader functions
as planning of DBP's SMI lending program, formulating guidelines for SMI
project promotion, establishing investment priorities for SMI financing and
assessing the effect of DBP's SMI lending policies.
4.06      At present, the operating core of Branch organization consists of
an Investment and Project Development Division responsible for evaluation of
projects of all sectors and a Project Supervision and Acquired Assets
Division responsible for supervision of all projects and acquired assets.
This set-up, based on functional lines is not conducive to optimum utilization
of specialized staff expertise. To address these problems, DBP is reorga-
nizing its Branches. The new organization would lead to a better utilization
of staff expertise. DBP assured the Bank that sectoral specialization, both
in terms of manpower allocation and staff qualifications, would be introduced
in the PID responsible for large projects. The administrative control of
the branches is generally satisfactory, and has become closer since the
single Branches and Agencies Department (BAAD) was bifurcated in 1976, BAAD
I for Luzon branches and BAAD II for Visayas and Mindanao branches.
4.07      Management.  Dr. Placido L. Mapa, Jr./l succeeded the late
Mr. Leonides S. Virata in October 1976 /2 as Chairman and chief executive
officer of DBP. The appointment of Dr. Mapa, who has considerable experience
in banking and economic management, is a clear indication of the Government's
commitment to pursue vigorously the ambitious institution building tasks
intitiated by the late Mr. Virata. Dr. Mapa's performance in his first year
in office indicates that he will press ahead with these tasks as rapidly as
broader constraints permit. Dr. Mapa's leadership will be an important
factor in DBP's attaining further improvements expected during the progress
of the proposed loan. Management at the department level has remained
stable; increasing experience of department managers has mostly resulted in
gradual but discernible improvements in control over operations. The second
layer of management of IPD I which showed signs of weak supervision capabi-
lity was replaced in 1977, considerably strengthening the management of this
department. The department level management both in IPD II and BAAD contin-
ues to remain sound. While quality of branch management continues to
improve generally, it has been constrained by manpower shortages and the
lack of clear lines of communications with Head Office especially with
respect to SMI. DBP's management is aware of these problems and is taking
appropriate corrective steps.
/1 Dr. Mapa, Jr. is a former Alternate Executive Director of the Bank and
its present Alternate Governor for the Philippines.
/2 Mr. Leonides Virata took leave from active service in February 1976.
During the intervening period DBP was headed by its Vice-Chairman,
Mr. J.V. de Ocampo.



- 22 -
4.08      Staffing.  As of August 31, 1977, DBP's total staff numbered 3,501,
distributed in a 48:52 ratio between Head Office and Branches and a 60:40
ratio between professional and non-professional staff (Annex 4, T-2). DBP's
staff increased rather rapidly by 12.1% between October 1976 and August 1977;
the staff turnover rate during the same period was low (2.6% of the average
staff). This increase notwithstanding, DBP continues to experience staff
shortages, particularly in respect of the specialized technical staff.
DBP's management is taking a number of measures to resolve the staffing
problems. It has budgeted for an increase of 971 staff /1 (or an increase of
27.8% over the present staff) who are expected to be recruited within the
next 12 months. Until recently, the main reason for DBP's inability to
attract suitable professional staff, especially technical staff, was that its
salary scales were below even those of some of the Government financial
institutions. In December 1977, the Government prescribed a uniform and
substantially upgraded salary scale for Government financial institutions which
should greatly enhance DBP's ability in the future to recruit and retain high
calibre staff. Other actions being taken by DBP are: (a) streamlining of
procedures and the organization which would make possible more efficient
deployment of the existing staff; (b) improved and intensified staff training
(para. 4.12); and (c) provision of greater career advancement opportunities
by making it easier for the technical staff to be consiLdered for supervisory
positions. These steps should ease DBP's staffing situation but will take
some time.
4.09      Staffing for Industrial Lending.  Plans for augmenting IPD I
staff, discussed at negotiations in October 1975, are nlow being translated
into action. Total department staff strength has been increased to 109 (as
of September 30, 1977). With its present staff, IPD I is adequately equipped
to cope with all aspects of project evaluation and supervision and should be
able to handle the growing workload over the foreseeable future through
improvements in productivity. While generally the quality of staff in IPD I
is satisfactory, most of them are relatively inexperienced. This is partly
due to the transfer of more experienced staff to strengthen other and new
departments. However, the staff is gradually learning through experience and
by attending various training programs.
4.10      As of September 1977, total staff in IPD II was 123, of whom 101
were professionals; between September 1976 and September 1977 the number of
professional staff increased by 33%. DBP's plans for increasing staff in IPD
II were reviewed during negotiations and satisfactory understandings reached.
IPD II plans to increase the number of its professional staff by 40% (or 40
more staff) by September 1978. The actual members will, however, be limited
to the number of new staff that it can train and absorb without impairing the
quality of its operations. Furthermore, IPD II is giving priority to the
recruitment of additional manpower for PSG and the IPG, whose functions have
become of greater importance, engineers and economists.
4.11      In the Branches the staffing problem is more acute.  Several
Branches have not been able to recruit or retain engineers for their SMI
operations and have had to resort to temporary stop-gap arrangements. DBP's
/1 Of these 971 positions, 685 or 70.5% are accounted for by professional
staff slots.



- 23 -
management is aware of this problem and is formulating measures to make it
more attractive for engineers to work in the branches. The recent Government
decision to upgrade DBP's salary scales (para. 4.08) would facilitate DBP's
efforts in this direction. Nevertheless in the Branches where there is a
high level of SMI lending (such as Cebu, Davao, Dagupan and Iloilo), DBP has
maintained an adequate engineering staff for SMI. The overall quality of the
staff in the Branches appears to be satisfactory, although there are consi-
derable variations from Branch to Branch. This has necessitated extensive
training programs, discussed in para. 4.12.
4.12      Training.  DBP now provides extensive on- and off-the-job training
programs (internal and external) for almost all cadres of its staff. In
FY77 in all 26 different kinds of training programs were conducted/arranged,
for 971 staff members. In addition, 16 staff members attended different
specialized training courses held abroad. Special attention was paid to the
training needs of: (a) staff working on SMI projects; (b) staff in the
Branches; and (c) staff working on livestock and fisheries projects. DBP's
future training plans call for: (a) continuation of most of the existing
programs; (b) some new sophisticated special training for agricultural and
industrial projects staff; and (c) collaboration with Development Academy of
the Philippines with a view to organizing advanced training courses for its
own staff as well as of other development institutions in the country. This
training strategy is quite satisfactory.
Operating Policies and Development Strategy
4.13      Operating Policies.  There have been no amendments to DBP's Charter
in the past three years nor to its Statement of Operating Policies and Proce-
dures for Medium/Large Scale Industrial Financing (adopted under the conditions
for Loan No. 998-PH), attached as Annex 2. The guidelines established in its
Charter and Policy Statement are augmented by specific Board resolutions. In
the past two years, several major policy changes were introduced and were
aimed at: (a) streamlining internal operating procedures; (b) strengthening
DBP's financial management; (c) standardizing and rationalizing lending terms
for industry; and (d) liberalizing terms and conditions of DBP's small loan
programs for industry and agriculture. To a very large extent these changes
have achieved the objectives for which they were made. DBP's policy framework
governing SMI operations represents a radical improvement over the set of
policies which were operative in late 1974 when the first SMI project (Loan
No. 1120-PH) was appraised. The new policies have significantly relaxed the
requirement for collateral and debt/equity ratio, have liberalized working
capital financing, set realistic guidelines for repayment terms including
grace period and provided for cost overrun financing. During negotiations,
DBP confirmed that henceforth it would extend its working capital financing,
in cases where fixed asset financing is not involved, to all SMI projects and
would not confine it to export-oriented projects and that the SMI borrowers
will benefit fully from the liberalized policies within the limits of prudent
loan evaluation criteria.
4.14      Development Strategy.  DBP has formulated a statement of strategy
for industrial development in 1978-79 which was reviewed during negotiations.
The agreed version of the strategy statement (Annex 3) highlights development
objectives that DBP hopes to achieve in the next two years. The objectives



- 24 -
in respect of DBP's large industry financing operations include inter alia:
(a) greater emphasis on relatively smaller and medium size industrial enter-
prises; (b) intensified promotional role designed to encourage new entrepre-
neurs; (c) adoption of an investment priority plan for large industries and
within this plan selection of projects on the basis of their contribution
towards development of the country's natural resources, favorable impact on
the balance of payment position, geographical decentralization of industry
and creation of new jobs at a relatively lower investment cost; (d) compre-
hensive appraisal of projects seeking DBP's guarantee assistance; (e) mobili-
zation of additional resources both from internal and external sources; and
(f) development of staff. The main features of DBP's development strategy
for SMI are: (a) constant efforts to improve DBP's institutional set-up to
make it fully responsive to the needs of SMI projects; (b) relaxation in its
working capital financing policy (para. 4.13); (c) adoption of an investment
priorities plan to serve as a rational basis for project screening and
selection; and (d) specific strategies aimed at achieving geographical
dispersal of SMI, optimum utilization of local raw materials, conservation of
energy, and encouragement to export and promotion of labor-intensive industries.
Finally, DBP's development strategy also aims at increasing its technical
assistance to the country's smaller development finance institutions such as
PDBs.
Project Appraisal and Supervision
4.15      Project Appraisal.  Since the appraisal of the most recent DFC loan
(No. 1190-PH) the improvement in the quality of DBP's industrial appraisals
has been slow but steady. The training and development of new and relatively
inexperienced professional staff /1 recruited after IPD I lost its experienced
staff to other new departments has entailed more time than was originally
expected. Besides, the former weakness at the supervisory level, which has
since been eliminated, also contributed to the slowness oiE improvement in the
quality of appraisals. Generally, the appraisal reports are comprehensive and
the methodology used is appropriate. The reports, however, are sometimes
excessively descriptive and not sufficiently analytical especially in DBP's
market analysis. Until recently, the market work was undertaken by the
Business Research Department, and concentrated too heavily at times on the
broader aspects of the overall market, rather than on the prospects of market-
ing the output of the project under review. In an effort to improve the
quality of its marketing analysis, IPD I has set up its own Marketing and
Economic Analysis Section, and this should lead to more relevant and project-
oriented market evaluation. IPD I is currently giving high priority to staffing
this Section. The quality of technical analysis of projects has suffered to
some extent because of DBP's difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified and
experienced engineers. For upgrading the quality of technical evaluation, DBP
has agreed to use the services of outside independent consultants on a selec-
tive basis for large and/or complicated projects, when it feels that its
in-house capability is limited. At present, DBP calculates economic rates of
return for projects of US$2 million and over using Bank funds; it has now agreed
to calculate ERRs for all projects with DBP's involvement of over US$500,000
/1 Alout 50% of the professional staff has less than three years experience
oT project appraisal; about 20% have experience of one year or less.



- 25 -
irrespective of the source of financing. DBP has also agreed that its
appraisal reports will bring out more explicitly the employment impact in
terms of jobs created and, in that context, it will discuss the aspects of
choice of technology and cost per job. DBP carefully examines the environ-
mental impact of its projects and takes due precautions to ensure that each
project complies with the Government's antipollution regulations. As a
matter of policy, where necessary, DBP insists that its subborrowers include
antipollution equipment and facilities under its financing.
4.16      There has been a steady improvement in the quality of SMI appraisals
done in IPD II. Analytical techniques, such as break even and sensitivity
analysis introduced about a year ago, are now standard practice for loans over
P 500,000 and the internal financial rate of return is now calculated for all
loans over P 1.0 million. The quality of appraisals done in the Branches
(usually for loans below P 500,000) varies widely from Branch to Branch. In
January 1978, DBP set up SMI Assistance Units comprising two experienced staff
members (division chief level) for each of the three major regions (Luzon,
Visayas and Mindanao) to assist the Branches among other things, in upgrading
the quality of their SMI appraisal work. The recently completed project eva-
luation manual would complement these efforts. In addition, an understanding
was reached between the Bank and DBP on other specific steps to upgrade further
the quality of appraisals, including a more thorough treatment of working capital
requirements, and the calculation of ERR for all SMI loans over P 1.5 million.
4.17      DBP's management has taken a number of steps /1 to streamline the
appraisal procedures in IPD II and the Branches with a view to shortening
the processing time. These measures notwithstanding, the average processing
time for SMI loans has tended to increase on account of a rapid increase in
the volume of SMI operations and emphasis on higher standards of appraisal
quality. DBP's management recognizes that loan processing time is unsatis-
factory and is endeavoring to reduce it to 60 days in both IPD II and Branches
and to 30 days for IPD II to review branch cases. Reduction of SMI loan
processing time now forms a part of DBP's development strategy. Average
processing time for large industry loans is reasonable.
4.18      Project Supervision.  As discussed during negotiations for the
second DFC loan, in November 1975, IPD I took steps to improve project super-
vision by introducing work scheduling for systematic project visits and
reviews of periodic submissions by clients. However, these measures could not
be adhered to. Consequently, supervision of large industrial loans is often
not carried out regularly, and the objective of identifying and overcoming
project problems as they arise has not been reached. The problems with
supervision in IPD I are to some extent a function of the workload on the
staff; supervision staff are also responsible for loan servicing (disbursements,
billing), limiting the time they can spend on supervision (para. 4.05).
/1 The most significant step was increase in the discretionary authority
of Branch and Department managers from P 20,000 to P 150,000.



- 26 -
However, DBP's management has decided to separate the servicing and supervision
functions within IPD I, which, coupled with the recent clLange in the management
of Project Supervision Group (para. 4.07) would considerably ease the situation.
IPD I has also prepared a supervision manual, which includes a complete
work program for project visits, reporting, follow-up action and feedback
system.
4.19      An important element of DBP's industrial loan supervision system is
its representation on the Boards of client companies. Besides serving as a
means of protecting DBP's interests, this representation has the potential of
working as an effective means of feedback. Unfortunately this mechanism
has not fully served its latter objective on account of: (a) nomination of
non-DBP personnel; and (b) inadequate liaison between IPD I and the appointed
representatives. DBP management has now adopted a new policy which ensures its
representation through its own staff members. Steps are also being taken to
improve coordination between IPD I and DBP's representatives.
4.20      On account of the pressing urgency for DBP to deal with a rapidly
growing backlog of loan applications in FY75 and FY76, progress in designing
and implementing appropriate systems for supervision of SMI projects was very
slow in those years. However, in late 1976, DBP's management, recognizing
the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, started taking a series of
corrective measures. IPD II was reorganized in 1977 and is being further
reorganized (para. 4.05) with one of the objectives being a strengthening of
project supervision. IPD II has recently finalized an SMI project supervision
manual which has been adopted and circulated to all the Branches. The manual
is adequately detailed and comprehensively covers all aspects of project
supervision. IPD II is also well advanced in its plans to engage the services
of outside collection agencies to handle small accounts of up to P 2,000
(over 1,100 accounts) where cost of supervision is not commensurate with
expected benefits. These efforts will improve supervision of SMI projects,
but to further strengthen and intensify such efforts DBP has decided to launch
a special supervision program which inter alia includes: (a) a schedule of
periodic project visits, reporting and follow-up action; (b) greater use of
outside agencies for handling smaller accounts; (c) special diagnostic
reports on larger SMI loans in default; (d) enforcement with greater intensity
of reporting requirement for all clients; (e) monitoring by IPD II of the SMI
project supervision done in Branches; and (f) regular reports to the Bank on
the progress of SMI supervision. This program was reviewed during negotiations
and is satisfactory.
Procurement and Disbursements
4.21      DBP's procurement and disbursement procedures for large industrial
loans as well as for SMI continue to be satisfactory. DBP's procurement
procedures adequately ensure that purchases from its subloans are made with



- 27 -
due regard for economy and efficiency. Subborrowers are required to submit
at least three (normally more) proforma contracts/or quotations for the
equipment being procured from two or more member countries of the Bank. An
evaluation is carried out by DBP's engineers as to whether equipment finally
selected by the project sponsor is suitable and competitively priced. Funds
are disbursed against supporting documentary evidence of purchase and/or
physical inspection by DBP staff of project's progress. DBP's procurement
and disbursement performance in respect of previous industrial and SMI loans
(Nos. 998-PH, 1120-PH and 1190-PH) has been satisfactory so far.
Internal Reporting
4.22      DBP's internal reporting system and quality of reports is gradually
improving. The most impressive improvement has been shown in DBP's arrearages
reporting with recent arrears reports being increasingly comprehensive and
analytical. The recently created Control and Planning Department (CPD) is
currently reviewing various internal reports with a view to consolidating them
and making them more meaningful and comprehensive. Constant improvements in
the record keeping both at Head Office and the Branches are being made by using
better data processing equipment. Whereas DBP's reporting on its totality of
financial affairs and operations is very satisfactory, it needs better repor-
ting on its individual financing programs. Suggestions made by the Bank to
address this problem have been accepted by DBP's management.
B. DBP's Role in the Economy
DBP in Perspective
4.23      DBP plays an important role in the Philippine economy, being the
largest supplier of long-term credit. Over the period FY73-77, DBP's opera-
tions amounted to P 15.4 billion; at the end of 1976, DBP held 11% of the
assets of the Philippine financial system and was responsible for financing
13% of gross fixed capital expenditure. The major proportion of DBP's
activities are in industry where it is involved in both large undertakings
such as mining, textiles and chemicals, and also in the financing of small-
scale industry. DBP also provides loans to small farmers and its agricultural
activities include the financing of cereals, feedgrains, food crops, live-
stock, poultry and fisheries. In addition, it is engaged in financing real
estate, hospitals, shipping, transport, rural banks and PDB.
4.24      As of June 30, 1977, DBP's accumulated approvals of loans, guaran-
tees, and equity investments amounted to P 27.6 billion (436,000 projects).
The sectoral allocation was as follows: industry (66%); agriculture (20%),
real estate (10%), and other (4%). DBP plans to invest P 7.7 billion in
industry over the next five years which is equivalent to about 9% of the total
as projected in the five year plan (1978-82).



- 28 -
Economic Impact
4.25      Impact of Large Industry Financing.  The sheer magnitude and
diversity of DBP's operations make it a vitally important institution in
the Philippines. The absence of reliable and comprehensive data makes it
impossible to quantify this impact adequately. However, some indication can
be had by considering the loans made over the last two years by IPD I. Eighty-
five large projects were financed with a total capital out'Lay of P 2,319.4 mil-
lion /1 of which DBP's financing amounted to 37%. An estimated 15,000 jobs
were created /2 at an average cost per job of $18,000, which is lower than
the average for BOI approved projects /3. An estimated $252 million will be
generated in exports as 35 of these projects plan to export at least a part
of their output. The ex-ante internal financial rate of return, weighted by
project cost, was 27%.
4.26      Economic Impact of IBRD Industrial Financing.  The Bank has had
an important influence on DBP's industrial lending.  DBP has received two
IBRD loans for large industrial projects./4 Details of 47 subprojects
financed so far under these loans are shown in Annex 4, T-3 and T-4.  The
textile industry /5 has received 34% ($28.1 million) of Bank financing.  The
remaining loans were evenly distributed over a range of industries.  Thirty-
two of the 47 projects financed estimate that at least a part of their pro-
duction will be for export resulting in foreign exchange earnings of about
$217 million annually. Bank-financed projects are expecte,d to generate 9,500
jobs /6 at an estimated average capital cost/job of $27,1()0. The cost/job
varies from $80-90,000 for two synthetic yarn projects,/7 to $1,500-2,000
for garment manufacture. The average cost/job has declined from $30,000
for the first loan to $24,500 for the second loan./8 In terms of regional
/1  Excluding a large mining project, Marinduque Mining.
/2  This excludes refinancing where no employment is generated.
/3  The average cost per job of BOI approved projects in 1976 was $22,700.
/4  Loan No. 998-PH for $48 million was fully committed by September 1976.
Loan No. 1190-PH was for $50 million of which $35.5 million was
committed as of mid-April 1978. This loan should be fully committed
by June 1978.
/5  These projects covered the whole range of textile industry and included nylon
filament yarn, polyster yarn, and both woven and knitted textiles.
/6  Plus another 5,000 seasonal jobs in a tobacco redryirLg project.
/7  Appraised in 1974.
/8  The cost per job of projects in the pipeline of the balance of Loan
No. 1190-PH is around $15,000.

distribution, 17 projects were based in Metro-Manila, 21 in Central and
southern Luzon and Mindanao and 7 in the Visayas, Bicol and Northern Luzon.
(The remaining two projects were for overseas shipping). The economic rates
of return on subprojects ranged from 10% (sucro-chemical plant and textile
mill) to 79% (footwear) with a weighted average of 29%.
4.27      Responsibility for industrial promotion rests with the BOI; DBP
operates as a financing agent within the incentive framework provided by the
BOI. DBP does, however, carry out its own project appraisals using the
economic rate of return as an indicator of the project's economic viability.
Consequently, DBP's project analysis should result in a better allocation of
resources. At present DBP does not calculate the economic rate of return for
all projects it finances, but it has now decided that it would do so for all
projects in excess of $500,000 (para. 4.15). This should result in an even
more efficient allocation of resources in the future.
4.28      Impact of SMI Financing Program.  In 1970, DBP launched its first
program to develop SMI. Between FY72 and FY77 this program financed 1,116 SMI
units to the extent of P 452 million./l Bank-financed SMI projects have
generated an estimated investment of P 410 million (Annex 4, T-5 and T-6).
A total of 410 /2 SMI projects were financed under Loan No. 1120-PH or about
14% more than the 360 predicted at appraisal.  So far, 389 SMI projects have
been financed by DBP under the SMI component of Loan No. 1190-PH;/3 at this
rate, DBP will probably exceed the appraisal target number of subprojects (500)
under this loan too. The average loan size for subloans under Loan
No. 1120-PH was P 369,000 or about 6% less than the average of P 393,000
estimated at appraisal. Under Loan 1190-PH, the average loan size declined
slightly to P 363,000 resulting in a better distribution than expected at
loan reallocation. Of the loans made under the two IBRD loans, 92% and 91%,
respectively, went to small entrepreneurs whose assets at the time of loan
application were under P 1.0 million. However, a slightly higher propor-
tion of DBP financing (29%) has gone to borrowers with assets of over
P 1.0 million under Loan No. 1190-PH than under Loan No. 1120-PH (25%).
Under Loan No. 1120-PH DBP's SMI loans were fairly evenly distributed among
industries: mechanical/electrical machinery and equipment industry (14%);
ice plants and cold storage (12%); and extractive industries (10%). Projects
/1 Approximately P 292 million or 65% of the assistance provided came from
loans 1120-PH and 1190-PH.
/2 This is updated figure based on the finally disbursed amount. It is
different from the figure (336) reported in the President's Memorandum
(R77-29) on the proposed Amendment to the Loan Agreement No 1190-PH,
because of reallocation of some projects.
/3 Of the allocation of $25 million, $14.1 million was committed as of
August 31, 1977; the balance is expected to be committed by April 1978.

so far financed under Loan No. 1190-PH have been more labor intensive than
in the past, but not to the extent hoped for at loan reallocation. Regarding
regional distribution of investment, expectations have, to a large extent,
been realized by project performance. Under Loan No. 1120-PH Metro-Manila
accounted for about 42% of SMI investment and a similar proportion of DBP
financing which was somewhat lower than the 51% share expected at appraisal.
Under Loan No. 1190-PH, the comparable figures were 43% and 36%. The rest
of Luzon accounted for a smaller share of SMI investment under Loan No.
1190-PH (28%) than under Loan No. 1120-PH (30%) and a larger share of
DBP financing. The share of the Visayas increased under Loan No. 1190-PH
for both investment (20% vs. 17%) and DBP financing (21% vs. 18%), most of
the gain accruing to the less-developed region of Eastern Vrisayas. The
resources going to Mindanao have remained approximately the same under both
loans. However, within Mindanao the share of the Northern and Western
regions doubled while that of the Central and Southern regions declined by a
third.
4.29      A study of the economic impact of a sample /1 of SMI projects
financed under the two IBRD loans was conducted by DBP's Business Research
Department and showed that the projects' ERR ranged from 13.7%-116% with a
weighted average ERR of 49.5%. These projects are estimated to have a value
added component of P 175 million (over 20% of sales) comprising: wages
(44%),/2 profit (37%); and financial expenses (19%). It is estimated that 15%
of the sales, amounting to E 127 million, will be for export.
4.30      Employment Generation Impact of SMI Financing.  The 799 SMI projects
financed under the Bank loans are expected to generate about 13,941 new jobs /3.
The average cost per job is P 27,024 ($3,654) under Loan No. 1120-PH and
P 48,600 ($6,920) under Loan No. 1190-PH. The higher average cost per job
under Loan No. 1190-PH occurs because of a few large capital intensive projects
(22 out of 389) approved in FY77. If these were excluded, the average cost per
job would fall to P 29,241 ($3,954)./4 About 31% of the loans made under
/1  This sample covered 49 SMI projects approved during April 1976 - June
1977 for which economic rates of return were calculated and 445 projects
for which partial economic indicators based on appraisal estimates were
aggregated.
/2 At appraisal ratio of wages to value added was estimated at 32%.
/3  7,536 jobs under Loan No. 1120-PH and 6,405 jobs under Loan No. 1190-PH.
/4  The average cost per job for an SMI project is approx:Lmately 25% of that
of larger projects.

these two Bank loans would qualify as urban poverty lending. /1   In terms
of size of the sub-borrowers, over 90% of the loan amount went to sub-
borrowers with fixed assets below $250,000 /2 at the time of application to
DBP. The average wage per worker ranges between P 5,400 and 6,700 which is
50% higher than the minimum wage rates.
4.31      Resource Mobilization.  DBP has played an important role in mobil-
izing long-term resources both internally and externally. Over the period
July 1975-September 1977, DBP raised P 847 million through the sale of its
Countryside bills. DBP has also on its own raised substantial long-term
foreign exchange resources from the international commercial sources; since
its first borrowing of $50 million in 1972, DBP has raised $315 million (6
loans) from foreign commercial banks./3 DBP also operates as a tax receiving
agency for the Government; taxes collected by DBP average E 40 billion per
annum.
4.32      Other Activities.  Besides its SMI financing programs, DBP has
established special programs to finance cottage industries and help lower
income groups through participation in such programs as the Manila Urban
Development Project which provides term credit for improving housing and
establishing small businesses in the region. Its real estate financing
program also provides resources for construction and low cost housing improve-
ment; in FY76 and FY77 alone DBP made 8,446 such loans amounting to P 94 mil-
lion. DBP has also helped to establish and provide financial and technical
assistance to 34 PDBs. In their turn these institutions mobilize local
savings and utilize them to meet medium-term credit needs of the economy.
C. Operations
Overall Financing Operations
4.33      Overall Operations.  DBP's operations include loans, guarantees and
equity investments. A summary of its operations is shown in Annex 4, T-7. Since
1947 until June 30, 1977 DBP's cumulative approvals amounted to P 27.6 billion,
of which 51% occured in the 27-year period, FY47-73 and 49% over the four years,
FY74-77. Since FY75 loans have replaced guarantees as the most important type
/1 The urban poverty threshold figure for 1977 being US$3,600.
/2 This is the ceiling suggested in the recent Bank report, "Employment
Creation and Small-Scale Enterprise Development" (No. 1543 dated
March 22, 1977).
/3 This excludes DBP's borrowings from international lending institutions
and under bilateral agreements.



- 32 -
of operation owing to the increased availability of resources for onlending/L;
equity investments have not been particularly significant. Over the period
1972-76 DBP's total approvals rose from P 1.8 billion to P 3.9 billion.
This secular increase came to a halt in FY77 when approvals dropped to
P 3.1 billion as a consequence of decreased agricultural lending, a fall in
guarantees, and a reduction in hotel financing.
4.34      In terms of sectoral allocation, as of June 30, 1977, industry,
agriculture and real estate had received 66%, 20% and 12% respectively of
total approvals /2 (Annex 4, T-8). The balance comprises credit extended
to local governments (1.3%) and the banking industry (0.7%) principally
to PDBs.
4.35      The size of DBP's investments vary from small loans (minimum
P 5,000) for handicrafts, tricycles /3 and water pumps to large investments in
manufacturing, mining and infrastructure. The number of small loans in
DBP's portfolio fell in FY77 owing to the phasing out of small "social
loans" (para. 4.36) and the decrease in agricultural lending (para. 4.45)
In general, DBP's guarantees pertain to large projects since only these have
access to suppliers' credits.
Industrial Lending Operations
4.36      Over the period FY47-77 DBP's cumulative industrial lending amounted
to P 5.61 billion for 30,780 accounts (Annex 4, T-9). Over the period FY73-76
the volume of industrial lending rose from P 55 million to P 1,080 million
and stood at P 1,079 million for FY77. The slight reduction in the volume of
lending reflected the slowdown in the growth of some Philippine industries
and the consequent fall in loan applications. Over the period FY76-77 the
number of loans dropped from 5,895 to 3,791 because of the sharp fall in
small loan applications for tricycle financing./4
/1  In the three-year period FY75-77 the proportion of loans in DBP's total
assistance approved was 66% as compared to an average of 10% for the
preceding three years.
/2  The financing of several large hotels in Manila in 1975 and 1976 had raised
the proportion of DBP resources going into real estate financing.
/3  Tricycles are a popular form of low cost transportation in the Philippines.
14  In FY76, 3,950 loans for P 181 million were made for tricycle financing.
The comparable figures for FY77 were 1,762 loans for P 52 million.

Features of Industrial Loans
4.37      Size of Loans.  Twenty-five projects,/L each over P 5 million
accounted for P 873 million or 75% of the value of loans approved in FY77.
DBP's position as virtually the largest source of long-term capital explains
the number of large-scale projects in its portfolio.  The smallest loan size
category (below P 50,000) accounted for 87% of the number of loans approved in
FY77 (81% on a cumulative basis) but only 3.6% of the value of approvals./2 A
structural change has occured in the size distribution of loans. Loans below
P 50,000, after increasing more than twofold between FY75 and FY76, fell by 40%
in number and 20% in value as a consequence of a fall in the tricycle financing
program. Simultaneously, there was a shift away from the P 2.0-5.0 million
loan category to the P 1.0-2.0 million category. The overall average size of
industrial loans, however, increased from P 183,000 in FY76 to P 285,000
in FY77.
4.38      Industry Distribution.  During the recent past, DBP's industrial
lending has covered a wide range of industries: mining (27% of lending in
FY75-77); transport (23%); and textiles (12%). The mining figure reflects
DBP's significant exposure in Marinduque Mining. DBP's operations in medium-
sized, labor-intensive industries /3 declined from 22.9% in FY75 to 11.0%
in FY76, but rose again to 25.7% in FY77. Of the manufacturing projects
approved during FY75-77, 61% were for the manufacture of consumer goods, 29%
for intermediate goods and 10% for capital goods. DBP's industrial lending
is influenced to a large extent by the BOI. While DBP can accept a project
not registered with the BOI, in practice projects would often not be commer-
cially viable without Board registration. Hence BOI decisions on incentives,
location, export targets and industry type are prime factors in determining
DBP's industrial loans.
4.39      Geographical Distribution.  Attempts to move industry out of
Metro-Manila are reflected in DBP's lending operations in FY77; the share of
DBP's industrial lending in Metro-Manila fell from 37% in FY75 to 31% in FY76
and 23% in FY77 (Annex 4, T-9). However, the amount of lending going to
areas near Manila such as Central and Southern Luzon, varied from year to
year. The most encouraging trend, however, is the increasing amount of
/1 This includes an exceptionally large loan of P 355 million to the Marinduque
Mining and Industrial Corporation, to finance the copper mining and
refining project.
/2 The average small loan size was P 12,000.
/3 Includes industries such as food processing, wood, leather, rubber and
nonmetallic products, cottage industries, extractive industries (excluding
large mining projects) and garments.

resources going to Mindanao, a relatively underdeveloped region, whose share
increased from 14% in FY75 to 41% in FY76 and 48% in FY77. While much of
this lending was for mining projects, other industries are also being developed.
DBP's industrial investment in the undeveloped regions of the Bicol, the
Cagayan Valley and Ilocos is still small.
4.40      Utilization of Industrial Loans.  The utilization of industrial
loans for the past five years is shown in Annex 4, T-10. The most striking
aspect of loan utilization is the volume of resources being used for refinanc-
ing of existing debts; P 324 million in FY76 and P 417 million in FY77. Most
of this refinancing affects two large accounts: Marinduque Mining, P 300 mil-
lion and P 299 million in FY76 and FY77 respectively; and Manila Brickworks,
P 118 million in FY77. The large increase in loans for working capital
reflects both the more liberal attitude of DBP's management towards working
capital funding and the concurrent need of many businesses for more working
capital owing to a slackening of demand. Loans for the purchase of machinery
and equipment fell considerably in FY76 but increased again in FY77.
SMI Lending Operations
4.41      Overall SMI Operations.  The Bank became involved with DBP's SMI
lending program in FY75. Over the two-year period, DBP's, SMI lending recorded
a twofold increase raising DBP's SMI portfolio from P 132 million (776
accounts) as of June 30, 1975 to P 384 million (1,588 accounts) as of June 30,
1977 (Annex 4, T-11). The rapid growth can be explained both in terms of the
increased availability of resources for SMI financing and the organizational
and policy changes put into effect. The table below shows the trend of DBP's
SMI operations:
DBP: TREND OF SMI LOAN APPROVALS

- 35 -
4.42      Despite a marginal reduction in the value of loans approved in FY77
there was a sharp increase in the number indicating a smaller average loan
size. When compared to previous years, a significantly higher proportion of
the loans approved in FY77 were from the Branches since Head Office staff
were more invol.ed in loan collection and establishing a supervision system
than in project evaluation.
4.43      Features of SMI Loans.  The majority of SMI loans fall within
P 100,000 - 500,000 range (Annex 4, T-12). While the average size of the small
industry loans fell from P 251,000 in FY76 to P 168,000 in FY77 the average
size of the medium industry loan continued its rising trend and stood at
P 1,807,000 for FY77.  Few loans are approved in the F 500,000 - P 1.5 million
range. The SMI loans are fairly evenly distributed among industries (Annex 4,
T-13). The growth industries in FY77 were food manufacturing (14.2% in FY77
v 7.2% in FY76) metal work (12.6% in FY77 v 4.6% in FY76) and nonmetallic
industries (7.0% in FY77 v 3.3% in FY76). The trend towards the financing
of capital intensive industries discernible in FY76 was reversed in FY77
when DBP reduced its financing of ice plants, cold storage and extractive
industries. While the share of Metro-Manila in the total number of loans
approved dropped from 41.9% in FY76 to 29.5% in FY77, it increased from
35.5% to 49.2% in value terms reflecting the larger average size loans
approved by Head Office (Annex 4, T-12). This increase in the share of
Metro-Manila was at the expense of the Visayas which experienced a decline
from 23.6% in FY76 to 13.3% in FY77. The underdeveloped regions of Northern
Luzon and Mindanao gained marginally. The proportion of DBP's SMI loans for
working capital increased from 9.6% in FY76 to 18.1% in FY77 while fixed
asset loans declined from 90% to 81.8%, reflecting DBP's increased awareness
of clients' needs for working capital finance (Annex 4, T-12). DBP permits
a maximum term of five years for its working capital loans and ten years for
fixed assets loans. The average maturity of loans both in FY76 and FY77 was
7.7 years (Annex 4, T-14). The majority of DBP's SMI borrowers continued to
be small entrepreneurs; in FY77, 82.6% of the recipients of SMI loans had
assets, at the time of application, of less than P 500,000; however,
because of their low average size such loans accounted for only 41.4% of
approvals. In contrast to FY76 most of the SMI loans approved in FY77 were
for expansion projects (72% of the number of projects), mainly due to growing
opportunities for small and medium indutries to expand.
4.44      In FY77 when considering loan applications, DBP changed its approach
from a "first-come, first served" to a more selective one based on a study of
the economic conditions prevailing within different industries. This was
supplemented by adopting in early 1978 of an SMI investment priorities plan
aiming at SMI promotion in less developed regions and subsectors. DBP's
short-term SMI development strategy also calls for selection of projects
based on projects economic contribution (para. 4.14). These efforts should
lead to a much deeper economic impact of DBP's SMI operations.



- 36 -
Agricultural Lending Operations
4.45      DBP is the main source of medium- and long-term institutional credit
for agriculture. DBP's agriculture portfolio, with over 21,700 accounts, stood
at P 2.1 billion which represents 80% of DBP's portfolio by number and 26% by
amount. DBP finances almost all sub-sectors of agriculture including food
and commercial crops, grain storage and processing, fisheries, livestock and
poultry. In FY77 DBP approved about 2,400 agricultural loans for P 510 mil-
lion, a decline of 63% by number and 39% by amount over approvals in FY76
owing to slowing down of DBP's "social loan"/1 programs which were facing
mounting arrears. The size of the average agricultural loan has increased
and was P 21,000 in FY77.
Real Estate and Community Development Lending
4.46      DBP's real estate lending, covering low-cost housing, hotels/
motels, resorts, and private hospitals amounted to P 295 million in FY77,
P 448 million in FY76 and P 1,057 million in FY75. The drop in real
estate financing occured as a result of a decline in hotel financing which
had been undertaken by DBP in FY75 and FY76 at the request of the Government.
In FY77, no financing was provided for new hotels in Manila as there is a
glut of luxury hotel rooms and most of the new DBP-financed hotels are
facing low occupancy rates and are consequently unable to service their
debts. DBP is permitting debt restructuring on a case-by-case basis. Under
the Agreement for Loan No. 1190-PH the Government undertook to make good
these arrears and cover any losses resulting from foreclosure. DBP has
financed resorts outside Manila to the extent of P 262 million in FY75 and
FY77.
4.47      With the emergence of the SSS, GSIS and NHC to provide finance
for residential construction, DBP's exposure in this activity has declined
and is now concentrated on the provision of low-cost housing. In FY75-77,
DBP made 13,600 loans averaging P 11,000 for cheap housing, and financed
a low-cost cooperative housing project of 250 units for P 2.5 million.
Private Development Banks Financing Program
4.48      DBP is actively involved in the establishmen,t and promotion of
PDBs. These banks, located in the provinces, have been established to
provide finance to small scale entrepreneurs and farmers. To date, DBP has
assisted in the establishment of 36 PDBs whose total resources at the end of
1976 amounted to P 476 million with loans outstanding of P 361 million.
/1  Social loan programs are implemented by DBP at the Government's request.
While these programs are deemed to be socially and economically desirable
they are invariably not financially viable. As there are few other
institutions capable of handling these programs, the Government has been
using DBP as a conduit.



- 37 -
Their portfolio comprised agricultural (46.9%), industrial (35.2%) and
miscellaneous (17.9%) loans. DBP's financial involvement in these banks
consists of equity investments in preferred shares; rediscounting facilities,
and savings and time deposits resulting from the sale of DBP Countryside
Bonds.  At the end of 1977, DBP's total outstanding financial as.-.stance to
the PDBs was P 94.1 million, comprising P 88.3 million in rediscounted loans,
P 2.7 million savings and time deposits; and P 3.1 million in equity participa-
tion. Owing to its substantial shareholding, DBP is represented on the boards
of the PDBs; DBP provides some technical assistance but is not otherwise
engaged in their management.
4.49      The major problems faced by PDB are lack of professional management,
inadequate appraisal and supervision techniques, poor portfolio performance,
and a weak financial position. In addition, DBP's own Department of Develop-
ment and Rural Banks (DDRB) dealing with PDBs needs to formulate its strategy
vis-a-vis PDBs, increase and upgrade the quality of its staff, and rationalize
its procedures. Despite the problems, PDBs could be an effective way of
channeling development funds to the rural areas and complementing DBP's
own lending to SSEs. Considering this potential and to increase significantly
its assistance to SSEs, DBP has contemplated a significant increase in its
financial and technical assistance to PDB in the next 2-3 years. An important
component of DBP's technical assistance would be the setting up in DBP of a
Development Banking Institute (DBI) (para. 5.04) to upgrade the expertise of
PDB management and staff. Morever, DBP is also currently reviewing the
present organization structure, policies and procedures pertaining to its PDB
operations handled by DDRB.
Equity and Securities Investments
4.50      DBP's equity investments comprise holdings acquired through
exercise of conversion options; investments in public enterprises under the
Government's equity financing programs; and equity investments in PDBs.
During FY77, DBP approved six equity investments totaling P 75.4 million.
As of June 30, 1977, its equity investment portfolio stood at p 798.2 million
of which 56% was in 8 Government-controlled companies and 44% in privately
owned companies. DBP and the Goverment are currently considering the possibi-
lity of DBP's divesting itself of three of these investments, totaling
P 397.6 million./l DBP has also an active securities portfolio which stood
at P 1,614 million as of June 30, 1977; most of the investments are in
Government-owned institutions.
/1 The three investments are Food Terminal Inc., National Steel Corporation (NSC)
and National Housing Corporation. DBP has provided 100% of the paid in
capital for the first two institutions and 25% for the third. In March
1978 DBP entered into a lease/sale agreement with Philippine Export and
Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation for sale of its total equity investments
(P 183 million) in NSC for P 222 million.

Guarantee Operations
4.51      DBP provides guarantees to cover:  (a) foreign suppliers' credits
for the import of capital goods; (b) commodity credit financing;/l and
(c) peso credits extended by local commercial banks to DBP clients, especially
for short-term working capital. While guarantees still account for the
largest share of DBP's cumulative financing operations, guarantee approvals
have declined since 1974.  A significant proportion of the value of the
foreign currency guarantees is concentrated in a few large accounts: in
FY76, 5 accounts were responsible for 80% of guarantees; in FY77, 4 accounts
accounted for 70%. If the large guarantees are excluded, the average guarantee
size for FY76 and FY77 would be $1.6 million. As of June 30, 1977 DBP's
outstanding contingent liabilities for guarantees amounted to the equivalent
of P 4.4 billion. Previously DBP provided guarantees for projects even if
they could borrow directly from DBP on the grounds that supplier credit terms
were more favorable than those offered by DBP. In addition, the size of the
suppliers' credit was often larger than DBP could have offered. DBP's
management has recently decided to offer a loan/guarantee package rather than
guarantees only.
Other Operations
4.52      To provide capital assistance for the establishment and development
of rural banks, the Central Bank established a trust fund administered by
DBP. Capital assistance is extended to rural banks in the form of subscrip-
tions to their preferred shares. For FY77, DBP invested a total of P 6.5 mil-
lion in 38 rural banks. As of June 30, 1977, total equity investments of DBP
in rural banks amounted to P 45.2 million. DBP loans to local governments
increased from P 57.9 million in FY76 to P 73.1 million in FY77.
D. Financial Condition, Financial Performance
and Quality of Portfolio
Financial Condition
4.53      DBP's balance sheets are summarized in Annex 4, T-15.  During the past
two years (FY76 and 77), DBP's total assets grew at an average rate of 35%
and reached P 14.3 billion as of June 30, 1977. During the same period DBP's
long term portfolio grew at the faster rate of 46%. The structure of assets
and liabilities has remained stable over the past two years. Long-term
portfolo accounted for the largest share (63%) of total assets as of June 30,
1977, followed by current assets (21%) and other assets, (16%). As of the
same date about 62% of total assets were financed through long term debts, 20%
through equity funds, and 18% through current and other liabilities.

4.54      In the past two years (FY76-77) a number of measures were taken to
bolster DBP's long term resource position. As agreed under conditions for
Loan No. 1190-PH the Government: (a) made an additional contribution of
P 883 million /1 to DBP's share capital;(b) converted P 940 million /2 of its
deposits from -hort-term into medium- and long-term. DBP, on its own, raised
additional long-term resources of P 1,916 million by issuing its Countryside
Bills amounting to P 728 million and raising P 1,188 million in foreign exchange
from international commercial sources. The net impact of these measures was
that DBP's total debt (including guarantees) to equity ratio which had been
showing a rising trend up to FY76 actually declined, albeit marginally, to
5.5:1,/3 while current ratio, a measure of liquidity, after deteriorating in
FY76 to 1:1 improved marginally to 1.2:1. Despite these favorable developments
DBP's liquidity is still dependent on the roll-over of short-term Government
deposits, a consequence of the persistent imbalance between maturity structure
of DBP's assets and liabilities. This makes DBP's liquidity position vulnerable
to any heavy withdrawals by the Government of its deposits, even though such
withdrawals are highly unlikely.
4.55      DBP's management recognizes this problem and is committed to
bolstering DBP's cash position through: (a) seeking a further increase in its
share capital by P 1.5 billion to P 4.0 billion by 1981; (b) selling DBP's
investments amounting to P 693.4 million /4 in its two subsidiaries and one
affiliate company; (c) improving loan collections; (d) obtaining compensation
from the Government for arrears on "social loans" made at the Government'a
behest; (e) accelerated sale of acquired assets; and (f) raising additional
long-term resources from the domestic as well as international markets. These
plans were discussed during negotiations when the Government agreed in
respect of (a) and (d) above, and also assured the Bank that with any with-
drawal of its deposits maintained with DBP, due consideration would be given
to DBP's liquidity position vis-a-vis its resource requirement and that the
Government would continue to assist DBP in arranging adequate long-term
resources.
4.56      Based on its present reasonably sound capital structure, its plans
for raising additional long-term resources, and its projected financial
position, DBP does not need any relaxation in its present debt to equity
ratio limitation of 10:1.
/1  This includes P 200 million contributed in September 1977 and P 28 million
capitalized profits.
/2  This compares with P 400 million which the Government had agreed to convert
No. 1190-PH.
/3  This is well within the limit of 10:1 specified in the Loan Agreement
No. 1190-PH.
/4  This consists of equity investment, P 397.6 million, and advances
against guarantees, P 295.8 million.

4.57      Foreign Exchange Risk.  During negotiations for Loan No. 1190-PH,
the Government and DBP undertook to reduce DBP's foreign excchange risk
exposure on its commercial borrowings. Consequently, DBP set up for the
first time in FY76 a "Reserve for Foreign Exchange Risk" and passed on foreign
exchange risk to all borrowers under its new foreign exchange borrowings.
However, contrary to expectations, the level of DBP's foreiLgn exchange risk
exposure rose from US$107 million in 1975 to US$267 million as of December 31,
1977, principally because of the use of the proceeds of its commercial foreign
exchange borrowings for repayments of maturing other obligations. This was
inevitable due to DBP's liquidity problems particularly in 1976. DBP's
management is endeavoring to reduce DBP's foreign exchange risk exposure.
Negotiations are under way with the CB to obtain year-to-year cover against
DBP's debt repayments. Currently DBP is in the process of identifying borro-
wers, particularly Government projects, that had in earlier years received
foreign exchange funds from DBP, with a view to persuading them to assume the
exchange risk on these funds.  Moreover, DBP has decided to use its foreign
exchange borrowings in future only for lending in foreign exchange and for
meeting foreign exchange debt maturities. The progress made on these matters
were reviewed at negotiations when it was ascertained that the measures
currently being taken by DBP would not only arrest any further increase in
DBP's exposure in foreign exchange risk, but would also considerably reduce
it in the near future./l
Financial Performance
4.58      DBP's summarized income statements are shown in Annex 4, T-16.  DBP's
net income rose from P 71.4 million in FY75 to P 84.7 million (3.9% return on
equity) in FY76, but declined to P 82.3 million (3.2% return on equity) in
FY77. DBP's profitability remains low, mainly because of its low lending
rates in the past and its inadequate collection performance. Measures
for enhancing DBP's income earning capability, discussed and agreed at
negotiations for Loan No. 1190-PH, are now being implemented with varying
degrees of effect on its financial performance. First the upward revision of
interest rates, which became effective in January 1976 resulted in the
increase of DBP's interest spread (on accrual basis) from 2.5% in FY75 to
3.3% in FY76 and 3.7% in FY77. The interest spread on an accrual basis will
further increase as high interest yielding loans assume a larger share of
DBP's portfolio. Second, along with changes in interest rates, DBP revised
upward its penalty charges. Third, since September 1976, DBP has begun
charging an annual service fee of 2% on new loan approvals exceeding P 150,000.
However, these measures have not yet been reflected in the financial statements,
since DBP reports income on a cash basis and financial expenses on an accrual
basis.
4.59      Being a Government-owned development oriented institution, the
character of which is manifested in a number of low income yielding social
lending programs undertaken at the behest of the Government, DBP's financial
performance should not be compared with the private, profit-oriented development
banks. Nontheless, DBP's management recognizes that its low profitability
increases its dependence on Government funds which are becoming increasingly
/1   DBP estimates foreign exchange exposure to reduce- to $124 million before
the end of 1978.



- 41 -
difficult to obtain due to budgetary constraints. Massive efforts are
therefore being undertaken to increase DBP's profitability by improving DBP's
collection performance (para. 4.65). Profitability targets on a departmental
basis have been set up and are being vigorously pursued. The proposed liqui-
dation of DBP's low income yielding investments (para. 4.55) and acceleration
of efforts to dispose of acquired assets would also improve DBP's return on
total investment. In addition, DBP's profitability needs to be insulated
against any losses it may suffer on the social lending programs. This can be
achieved if DBP has the freedom to finance only those programs which it finds,
based on its evaluation, financially viable; if on social considerations the
Government requires DBP to undertake programs not financially viable, DBP
should undertake them on an agency basis against back-to-back Government
funding. During negotiations, the Government agreed to this arrangement.
Audit
4.60      DBP's accounts are audited by the Commission on Audit (COA), a
Government body. The progress made by COA auditors since 1975, has been
mixed. COA auditors have prepared long form reports on FY75 and FY76 in line
with the Bank's "Illustrative Form of Audit for DFCs". These reports for the
first time contained some analysis of DBP's portfolio. Satisfactory progress
has been made in expanding the coverage of audit reports and streamlining the
audit procedures. However, there are still some shortcomings in reporting
standards and auditing procedures especially in the portfolio analysis.
Following its further discussions with the Bank, COA established in November
1976 a " Special Audit Study Team for DBP". In order to implement the
recommendations of this Team, DBP's COA auditors have formulated a "Program
of Action" and reached an agreement with DBP's management on the "Scope of
1977 Audit." These plans are somewhat ambitious but represent a genuine
comprehensive effort aimed at upgrading COA's audit coverage and practices.
During negotiations progress in implementing the "Program of Action" and
"Scope of 1977 Audit" was reviewed was found generally satisfactory. An
understanding was also reached with DBP and the Government with regard to the
submission of audit reports within the time limit of four months after the
close of the accounting year.
Reserves Policy and Position
4.61      As agreed during negotiations for Loan No. 1190-PH, DBP adopted
a Statement of Reserves Policy on January 21, 1976 and started making
provisions for doubtful accounts which as of December 31, 1976 stood at
P 66.1 million. These provisions were made on the basis of only a partial
review of DBP's portfolio and therefore are not adequate. The agreed "Scope
of 1977 Audit" (para. 4.60), calls for a comprehensive review of DBP's port-
folio. Progress on the proposed portfolio review and the provisions for
doubtful accounts will be discussed at negotiations. In accordance with



- 42 -
DBP's reserves policy, /1 20% of the profits for FY76 and July-December 1976
were appropriated to a foreign exchange risk reserve amounting to P 29.2 mil-
lion (about 2% of actual foreign exchange risk exposure) as of December 31,
1976 as of the same date the accumulated appropriations for contingencies
stood at P 129.8 million.
Portfolio Quality
4.62     Loan Portfolio.  Arrearages on DBP's loan portfolio, while having
been reduced over the past four years, continue to remain unsatisfactorily
high and constitute one major cause of DBP's tight liquidity situation. An
analysis of DBP's loan portfolio is given in Annex 4, T-17, while the follow-
ing summary shows the trend of arrears over the past three years:
DBP: ARREARAGES ON TOTAL LOAN PORTFOLIO
(As Percent of Total Outstanding)
No. of Accounts                              Principal
(As % of Total)       Actual Arrears        Affected
June 30, 1974                             56.6%                 23.5%               58.7%
(of which industrial loans)              (82.2%)               (21.6%)             (59.9%)
June 30, 1975                             60.0%                  15.5%              46.8%
(of which industrial loans)              (72.5%)               (12.7%)             (44.1%)
June 30, 1976                             71.6%                  10.2%              40.7%
(of which industrial loans)              (71.1%)                (7.5%)             (41.4%)
June 30, 1977                             77.7%                  10. 5%             44.3%
(of which industrial loans)              (77.3%)                 (6.5%)            (34.9%)
4.63     The improvement (in relative terms) in the overall arrears position
reflects the immediate impact of a major rescheduling effort coupled with a
rapid increase in the outstanding portfolio base. However, in the past two
/1 DBP's Reserves Policy requires it to appropriate its annual net income
after provisions for doubtful accounts as under:
(a) 20% to a reserve for foreign exchange risk up to a minimum of at
least 15% of DBP foreign exchange liabilities on which it
carries foreign exchange risk;
(b) 20% to share capital; and
(c) the remaining balance to a reserve for contingencies until
such time as this reserve is built up to at least 15% of
DBP's outstanding contingent liabilities.



- 43 -
years the number of accounts (especially small loans) in arrears has actually
been rising, shifting the structure of DBP's arrearages. Formerly, a large
share of arrearages was accounted for by a small number of very large accounts.
Now, an increasing share of arrearages is attributable to a very large number
of small accounts mostly relating to small industry, agriculture and "social"'
loans. To some extent the arrears position is exaggerated by inclusion of
"technical" arrears arising from remittance delays and delayed commencement
of initial repayments due to either project completion delays or insufficient
grace period allowed./l On a sectoral basis, agricultural loans continue to
experience the highest default rate with arrears amounting to 1 527 million
or 24.8% of total agricultural loan portfolio. Industrial loan portfolio has
the lowest arrears ratio of 6.5% having declined from 12.7% in the past two
years. The delinquency rate on cottage industry and SMI loans is much higher
than on the large industry loans. Arrears on large industry portfolio
carried by IPD I amounted to only 4% with only 29.4% of this portfolio
"infected" by defaults. SMI loan arrearages declined from 27.2% in FY75 to
24.0% in FY77, but the ratio of portfolio in default slightly increased
(Annex 4, T-18)./2
4.64     Various diverse factors are responsible for the continued high
delinquency rate on DBP's loan portfolio. Because DBP is the most important
source of term credit for almost all sectors, its portfolio is naturally
susceptible to any adverse downturn in business and economic conditions.
DBP's portfolio was severely hit first by the massive devaluation of 1972
and then by slack business conditions in recent years. Agricultural loans
were additionally hit in some areas, by natural calamities, floods, earth-
quakes and drought. In fact, in the past couple of years most of the
financial institutions in the Philippines, particularly those Government-
owned, experienced a deterioration of their loan portfolios (para. 3.25).
DBP's weak appraisals in the past and inadequate supervision efforts coupled
with DBP's stringent loan conditions especially for small loans /3 have also
contributed towards low loan recoveries.
4.65     DBP's management is committed to improving DBP's arrears situation.
As agreed during negotiations for Loan No. 1190-PH, DBP radically raised its
penalty charges and the reporting of arrears and billing of accounts were
greatly improved. Stringent conditions for small loans were relaxed (para. 4.13)
and some major steps are being taken to upgrade standards of appraisal and to
set up an effective supervision system. Furthermore, in mid-1977 DBP launched
a massive and generally well organized collection drive. Although it is too
early to expect the recent collection drive effort to radically transform
/1 About 12% of arrears (47% of delinquent portfolio) were overdue for 6 months
as of June 30, 1977.
/2 During negotiations for the first SMI loan to the Philippines (Loan No.
1120-PH) DBP had committed to reduce its ratio fo SMI arrears to 25%
of outstanding SMI portfolio by August 31, 1979. Thus, DBP achieved
this target two years in advance.
/3 Such as high loan collateral and debt equity ratio requirement, shorter
loan maturities, too short grace periods and limited working capital
financing.



- 44 -
the arrears picture, the collection data for the July-December 1977 period
indicated that the collection performance at least for industrial loans is
improving. DBP's collection drive is concentrated on loan collecting on an
individual account basis. Whereas this may be an effective approach for
large accounts, for small accounts, which account for 98% by number of
accounts in arrears and over 44% of actual total arrears, a sub-sector
approach would be more appropriate and manageable. DBP has, agreed to adopt
this approach. DBP's management has also agreed to make its collection drive
a permanent feature so as to achieve the following targets of reductions in
arrears:
June 30, 1979
SMI Portfolio       Total Portfolio
Arrears Ratio                  16%               7.5%
Rate of Portfolio
Affected                     40%               35%
4.66      Given the magnitude of the arrears involved and ithe diversity of
problems of the various sectors and subsectors served by DBP, an overnight
change in its arrears situation cannot be expected. The above targets are
therefore, considered realistic. During negotiations, the Government agreed
to reimburse to DBP the amount of the arrears on loans made at its behest.
4.67      Other Portfolio.  Arrears relating to DBP's guarantees have declined
quite substantially in the past two years; advances on guarantees as a
percentage of total outstanding guarantees declined from 13.5% in FY75 to 8%
in FY77. This reduction was mainly achieved through conversion of advances
into loans or equity investments. DBP is upgrading the standard of its
appraisal of guarantee requests so as to ensure that only viable projects are
entertained. About 56% of DBP's total equity investment as of June 30, 1977
was in companies which were either operating at a profit or were still in the
construction stage. Twelve companies in which DBP held investments of
P 345.4 million (43% of total) were operating at a loss, but DBP does not
consider its investments in jeopardy. Investments in companies in liquidation
amounted to P 3.0 million, fully covered by provisions for possible losses.
DBP's acquired assets portfolio has remained almost stagnant since June 30,
1976. Two largest accounts (Iligan Steel and Bay View Hotel) account for 90%
of the book value of total acquired assets. The appraisal value of acquired
assets as of June 30, 1977 exceeded their book value.

E. Prospects
Business Prospects and Projected Operations
4.68      The uncertain business climate generated by the worldwide recession
of 1974-76 has resulted in a much lower volume of DBP's financing for new
capacity creation in the industrial sector. However, over the next year,
the indications are that investment will pick up gradually. These expectations
are reflected in DBP's business forecasts which show that its overall level
of new loan approvals, after declining in aggregate terms in CY78, would
maintain a steady trend during CY79-82 /1 as detailed in Annex 4, T-19 and
summarized below:
DBP - PROJECTED NEW LOAN APPROVALS

/a   Inclusive of loans for transportation and public utilities.
4.69      Projections of approvals for CY77 are based on actual approvals in
the first half of the year and projects in the pipeline which are expected to
materialize. Approvals for CY78-82 are based on the anticipated investment
climate for each sector. Projected loan approvals assume that exceptionally
large industrial loans which characterized DBP's 1977 approvals would not be
repeated in future. This explains the 18% fall expected in approvals in
CY78. A lower volume of approvals for transportation and public utilities
projects have also contributed to this reduction.
4.70      DBP's projected SMI loan approvals are shown in Annex 4, T-20.  DBP
expects its SMI loan approvals to grow at 10% per annum except in CY79 when,
due to backlog demand, a 15% growth is expected. DBP's branches will be
playing a greater role in the future than in the past in financing new

SMI loans; their share in new approvals is expected to be around 60% by
number of approvals (vs. 50% in FY76/77) and 38% by amount. (vs. 30% in
FY76/77). The bulk (86%) of the loans would be in the size range of
P 50,000-800,000 absorbing about 46% of the total amount of approvals, an
increase from 41% in FY77, with a corresponding fall in the share of medium
industry loans.
Resource Requirements
4.71      As of June 30, 1977, DBP's net long-term resources stood at
P 547.5 million as detailed in Annex 4, T-21. Between July 1977 and June 30,
1980, a three-year period, DBP's total commitments for loans and investments are
estimated at P 7,808 million, the financing of which is projected as follows:

4.72      During negotiations, DBP's plans for raising the requisite
currency resources were reviewed while the Government's agreement was
obtained in respect of (a) proposed additional contribution to DBP's
share capital; and (b) help to DBP in raising the requisite resources.
4.73      The new borrowings from IBRD and ADB shown in the above table, inter
alia, include the proposed Bank loan of $80 million (P 592 million). This
loan will have the following three components:



- 47 -
US$ million
(a)  for large industrial projects    -  50.0
(b)  for SMI projects                   -  29.7
(c)  for technical assistance to PDBs -   0.3
Total                             80.0
4.74      The large industry loan component ($50 million) would finance about
41% of total new foreign currency commitments of IPD I in the two-year period
after June 30, 1978; DBP's existing foreign exchange lines of credit for
industrial loans are estimated to be fully exhausted in the third quarter
of 1978. Loans from ADB and foreign commercial sources would meet the
remaining 59% of the commitments. The SMI loan component ($29.7 million)
would finance 75% of DBP's SMI loans to be approved from May 1978 to June
1980./I DBP would finance the remaining 25% of SMI loans from its own
funds.
Financial Projections
4.75      Projected Financial Performance.  Based on its business forecast
(para. 4.68) and the assumed availability of resources, DBP's net income is
projected to rise rapidly from P 118 million in CY77 to P 336 million in
CY78, P 515 million in CY80, and P 979 million in CY82. This rather excep-
tionally high growth is due to: (a) rising weighted lending rate of DBP
as share of high interest yielding loans in total portfolio would increase;
(b) assumption of constantly improving collection performance of DBP /2;
(c) rapidly rising portfolio; and (d) conversion of accumulated interest on
hotel loans /3 into preference shares shown as income in CY78-82. If the
non-cash income from the hotels is ignored, the net income projected for
CY78-82 would decline by 35%. The projected level of net income would result
in increasing the gross return on average assets from 8.2% in CY76 to 9.7% in
CY78, 10.1% in CY80 and 11.6% in CY82. Over the same period the ratio of
administrative expenses to average assets is estimated to decline from 1.4%
in CY76 to 1.0% in CY82. DBP's projected income statements are given in
Annex 4, T-22.
4.76      Projected Financial Position.  DBP's projected balance sheets are
given in Annex 4, T-23 Total assets which stood at P 14.3 billion as of June 30,
1977 are estimated to increase to P 18.6 billion in CY78, P 23.6 billion in
CY80 and P 29.2 billion in CY82 showing an average annual growth rate of 15%.
This growth rate is slower than the 35% growth achieved in FY77 and the 22%
/1   The SMI component of the proposed loan is expected to finance about
855 projects generating a total investment of P 405 million and about
13,700 jobs at an average investment cost ot $4,000 per job.
/2   On an average a collection ratio of 60% is assumed.  The actual
collection ratio in CY77 was 57%.
/3   It is a part of DBP's rescheduling package for new hotels in Manila
facing low occupancy rates.



- 48 -
growth projected for DBP in the five year plan. The largest growth is shown
in the loan portfolio which over the same period shows a more than two-fold
increase. A large proportion of the additional investment is proposed to be
financed through borrowings, but the planned increase in paid-in capital,
coupled with a rapid increase in retained earnings, would enable DBP to
maintain a satisfactory long-term financial position; the ratio of total
debts (including guarantees) to equity is estimated to decline from 5.5:1 in
FY77 to 4.9:1 in CY78, 4.1:1 in CY80 and 3.3:1 in CY82. Similarly the
short-term financial position is strong with a constantly improving current
ratio of 1.2:1 in FY77, 2.1:1 in CY78, and 2.4:1 in CY80 and CY82. The
estimated debt service cover is less than unity in the second half of 1977
but improves gradually thereafter to a satisfactory level (Annex 4, T-24).
5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Objectives of the Proposed Loan
5.01      The objectives of the proposed loan are: (a) resource transfer;
(b) a further contribution towards achievement of the Philippine Government's
objectives in SMI development; and (c) continuation of the Bank's institution
building effort with DBP. The proposed loan would continue the Bank's
efforts to effect resource transfers for Philippine industrialization.
Funds under the proposed loan would be used both for large-scale industries
and for modern SMI. Investment in the large industry projects would aim at
further diversification of the country's industrial base by promoting
investments in nontraditional export industries, downstream domestic proces-
sing of traditional exports and creation of basic capital goods industries.
A wider geographical spread of new industrial investment than has been usual
in the past is also expected, thus contributing to the Government's efforts
to alleviate income disparities in the country. The SMI loan component
would promote additional investment in this sector, help maintain the flow
of institutional credit availability to SMI, achieve further regional
dispersal of SMI investment, contribute to optimum utilization of existing
SMI capacity by increasing availability of funds for working capital finan-
cing and create additional job opportunities at a low cost. Through these
means, the SMI project will contribute towards easing the urban poverty
problem in the Philippines.
5.02      Since the Bank made its first DFC-type loan in 1974, DBP has made
satisfactory progress in strengthening its institutional set-up, capability,
and performance, especially in respect of organizational structure, manage-
ment, quality of staff, procedures, operational policies, quality of apprai-
sals, and capital structure. DBP's multi-sectoral involvement and the
magnitude of its operations, make its institution-building task long and
arduous. Against this background the progress DBP has made in the past
three years is commendable. The proposed loan would afford the Bank an
opportunity to continue its association with the institution building
process. The specific areas where further improvements are expected are:



- 49 -
(a) quality of industrial and SMI appraisals and supervision; (b) a
reduction in loan arrears and improvement in loan portfolio; (c) strengthen-
ing of DBP's long-term resource position; (d) upgrading the quality of
audit; (e) more efficient resource allocation by setting investment priori-
ties; and (f) significantly enhanced impact of DBP's developmental role by
adopting a clearly defined development strategy. DBP's management is fully
cognizant of the need and importance of introducing further institutional
improvements and is making constant efforts to achieve them in close coopera-
tion and consultation with the Bank.
Justification of the Loan
5.03      For implementation of its development program for the next five
years, the Philippines would depend on a large net inflow of resources /1.
The proposed loan would result in a net resource transfer of $80 million,
not counting the net beneficial impact that the subprojects financed under
the loan would have on the country's balance of payment position. The
loan would be used for economically viable and sound large industry and
SMI projects thereby contributing to a balanced growth of the industrial
sector. Since the individual projects to be financed under the proposed
loan cannot be identified, at this stage, an ex-ante analysis of the
economic impact is not possible. However, it is expected that the sub-
projects financed will yield about the same level of economic and finan-
cial returns as projects financed under the previous three loans.
Features of the Loan
5.04      Purpose.  The large industry component of the loan would be used
to finance direct capital goods import requirement of eligible industrial
enterprises and the direct and indirect foreign exchange component of domes-
tically manufactured capital goods estimated at 50% and that of civil works
estimated at 45%. The SMI loan component would be used to finance fixed
assets and permanent working capital requirements of SMI subprojects.  The
proceeds of the proposed loan would finance 75% of each SMI loan represen-
ting the direct and indirect foreign exchange component of these projects /2.
As in the previous industrial loan, the proposed loan would not be used for
financing of subsectors already covered by other IBRD loans through DBP and
the rural credit loans through CB. In order to ensure an even geographical
dispersion of SMI subprojects and financing of a larger number of small industry
subprojects a limit of 10% of the SMI comDonent of the loan is proposed for
/1 According to the Five-Year Philippine Development Plan the total
foreign exchange requirement in 1978-82 period would be $43.4 billion.
/2   Based on a study of a sample of SMI projects, DBP has estimated that
on an average the direct and indirect foreign exchange component of SMI
projects, financed under Loan No. 1120-PH, was 58% and that DBP financed
75% of the project cost. Thus, about 75% of DBP's financing represented
foreign exchange component, the same as was estimated for SMI projects at
appraisal.



- 50 -
loans over P 1.5 million in Metro-Manila area. The PDB conmponent of the loan
($300,000) would help finance the establishing of the proposed Development
Banking Institute (DBI). To assist PDBs in overcoming their structural weak-
nesses and achieve their potential as retail development institutions, DBP has
proposed to establish DBI to be the focus of training programs to motivate,
transform, and develop PDB management as well as to upgrade staff capabilities
in project appraisal and supervision and in bank management: and systems. The
proposed establishment of DBI coupled with the anticipated improvements in
DDRB (para. 4.49) would hopefully justify in the future the Bank's participa-
tion in PDB financing, at least on a selective basis.
5.05      In the long run, the proposed DBI would also be able to offer its
training assistance to other smaller institutions such as rural banks. The
administration of DBI will be the responsibility of DBP's ]DDRB. DBI will
eventually be provided with complete facilities, vehicles, equipment, and
supplies to facilitate the discharge of its training functions. DBP, in
addition to a core group of 12 DDRB staff assigned to DBI, plans to engage
an experienced consultant to help it plan and implement DBI. The proposed
Bank loan component would finance 100% of the consultant's cost and direct
and indirect foreign exchange component in capital costs and operating costs
of DBI in its initial two years of operation.
5.06      Component for Financing Projects Conforming with the Bank's Urban
Poverty Program. As noted in para. 4.30, DBP has achieved satisfactory
results in terms of allocating the proceeds of the two SMI Bank loans to
small entrepreneurs and labor-intensive projects. It is important under the
proposed loan that DBP should continue to endeavor to reach smaller enterprises
and finance labor-intensive projects. Toward this objective, it is expected
that about 90% of the SMI loan component would be used for financing:
(a) projects which create employment at a gross capital cost per job of not
higher than $3,600 /1 the threshold figure for the Philippines as determined
by the Bank; or (b) enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding $250,000.
5.07      Form of Lending.  As for all earlier Bank loans to DBP and in
accordance with the Philippine Government's wishes the prcoposed loan would be
made to the Government and re-lent to DBP.
5.08      Currencies and Foreign Exchange Risk.  The Government would bear
the entire exchange risk on the loan component utilized for SMI financing and
the proposed DBI. The exchange risk on the loan component used for large
industry would be borne by the subborrowers.
5.09      Amortization Schedule.  As is normal for the Bank's DFC projects
the large industry component of the proposed loan would have a flexible
/1   This refers to 1977 prices.  An allowance for inflatiLon factor would be
made while reviewing the actual performance under the loan.



- 51 -
amortization schedule which would correspond roughly with the expected aggre-
gate amortization schedules of subloans financed. The maximum terms of such
subloans would be 15 years including a grace period. Since the number of
subloans under the SMI loan component would be much larger (over 850), for
the sake of administrative convenience a fixed amortization schedule stretching
over 20 years including a 5-year period of grace is recommended for the SMI
loan component as also for the PDB component. The maximum maturity of SMI
loans would be 12 years including the grace period. It is expected that the
proceeds of the entire proposed loan would be committed in two years and
disbursed within four years of the signing of the loan (Annex 4, T-25).
5.10      Free Limits.  For large industry subloans, a free limit of $1.5 mil-
lion is recommended; no aggregate free limit is proposed as free limit
projects accounted for less than 10% of commitments so far under Loan Nos.
998-PH and 1190-PH. It is expected that under the proposed free limit the Bank
would get an opportunity to review about 40% of subloans representing about
75% of the loan component. For the two SMI loans made by the Bank to DBP
no free limit mechanism was used as this was considered an inappropriate
mechanism for influencing the quality of appraisals. Instead DBP was required
to submit to the Bank monthly summary statements of SMI loans approved,
together with appraisal reports on all loans above P 500,000. Reviews of
these reports and regular supervision missions were considered sufficient to
ensure adequate supervision of the quality of appraisals. The experience
over the last three years has proved that the approach taken was a sound one.
The improvements made by DBP in its SMI loan appraisals could not have been
better or faster if subprojects had been subject to a prior review by the
Bank. No change in this approach is recommended for the SMI component of the
proposed loan.
5.11      Subloan Sizes.  DBP has assured the Bank that it would finance a
reasonably large number of projects under the proposed loan. It is recommended,
therefore, that the maximum size of the large industrial subloan be fixed at
$6.0 million. The average size of subloans under this component is, however,
expected to be about $1.8 million. The maximum size of SMI loans would be
P 2.5 million and minimum size P 50,000, which size range falls within the
definition of SMI.
5.12      Debt/Equity.  As noted in para. 4.56, DBP is not expected to need,
in the near future, any increase in its present borrowing capability which is
ten times its equity.
5.13      Relending and On-Lending Rates.  As for all previous Bank loans to
DBP, the Government would re-lend the loan to DBP at the prevailing Bank
rate, currently 7.5%. DBP would on-lend the loan at 12% p.a. to subloans
secured by land mortgage and at 14% p.a. secured otherwise. In addition, a
service fee of 2% would be charged on subloans over P 150,000 ($20,300).
However, considering the foreign exchange risk, the effective interest rate
on the foreign currency subloans, as past experience shows, would be in the
range of 20-22% which would mean a real interest rate of 12-14%; the
effective interest rate on SMI loans would, however, be in the range of
4-8%. In the event that DBP decides to modify its relending rates, the
Bank would be consulted on the rates to be charged to subborrowers.

in the recent Bank report "Employment Creation and Small
Scale Enterprise Development" (para. 5.06); and
Recommendation
5.16      A loan of $80 million is recommended for use by DBP in financing
small, medium and large productive industrial enterprises in the Philippines.

PHILIPPINES
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
Statement of Operating Policies and Procedures for Medium-
and Large-Scale Industrial Financing /1
1.        The policies, criteria and procedures set forth below will guide
DBP's medium- and large-scale industrial operations - particularly those
undertaken by Industrial Projects Department I and irrespective of the
sources of funds for financing these operations.
2.        Objectives of Industrial Financing.  To assist the development of
the country by providing financial and technical assistance for the estab-
lishment of new industries as well as for the balancing, modernization and
expansion of existing industries.
3.        Basis for Investment Decisions.  DBP will make investment decisions
on the basis of sound investment criteria and standards, and after careful
project evaluation. Financial assistance will be provided to those projects
which are financially and economically viable and technically feasible, and
for the implementation of which saitsfactory organizational and managerial
arrangements have been made.
4.        Method of Financing.  DBP will provide finance according to the
requirements of each project, in one or several of the following forms:
(a) direct loans in local currency, for financing local expenditures on
fixed assets and where appropriate for working capital;
(b) direct loans in foreign currencies, for financing imports of
equipment and/or new materials;
(c) guarantees of domestic currency and/or foreign currency credits
made on suitable terms;
(d) loans fully or partly convertible into stock;
(e) in exceptional and highly meritorious cases, direct equity invest-
ments and underwriting of share issues.
5.        General Investment Policies
(a) Financing will be provided to projects which are in line with
the investment priorities of the Government; preference being
given to projects registered with the Board of Investments (BOI)
under the Investment Incentives Act or the Export Incentives Act,
or with other pertinent Government regulatory agencies.
/1 Approved by the Board of Governors on May 29, 1974, under Resolution
No. 1571-A.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(b)  In accordance with normal banking practice, adequate security will
be required to cover the loans and guarantees, but the main con-
siderations will be the merits of proposed projects, their repay-
ment prospects and the soundness of management of the enterprise.
(c) DBP will not seek a controlling interest in any enterprise in which
it has invested, or any other interest which would give it responsi-
bility for management, except when in its judgement its investment
is in jeopardy, in which case DBP reserves the option of taking
such action as may be necessary to protect its interests.
6.        Project Appraisal Guidelines
(a) Each investment decision will be made on the basis of a thorough
project evaluation, reflected in an appraisal report, which will
be a self-contained and comprehensive document outlining facts,
analyses and judments on the essential aspects (including tech-
nical, marketing, management, financial and economic) of the
project as well as recommendations on special contractual arrange-
ments. In appropriate instances, the report will incorporate
essential complementary elements of the BOI's appraisal work, in
particular its ecomic evaluation and marketing analysis. These
inclusions notwithstanding, DBP's appraisal reports will in any
event include DBP's own judgments on these matters as well.
(b) Project appraisal will generally include the calculation of the
internal, financial and economic rates of return for projects of
which the total project cost exceeds US$2 million equivalent. If
the economic rate of return is below 10%, speciLal justification
will be required in the appraisal report which recommends a deci-
sion to finance the project.
(c)  Each appraisal report will provide in detail the estimated cost
of the project, including working capital requirements and ade-
quate contingencies. Prior to committing its own funds DBP will
satisfy itself that funds expected from sources other than DBP
(i.e., borrower's own contribution, plus borrowings from other
lending institutions) will be available in sufficient amounts when
needed to cover the total financing requirements of the project.
7.        Lending Terms
(a) Each industrial loan will be made on a term and with a grace period
consistent with the repayment capacity of the enterprise based on
projected cash flows, and related to the useful life of the asets
financed by the loan.
(b) Each investment project financed by DBP will normally have an equity
capital equivalent to 25% of total project cost. In the case of an
expansion project of an existing enterprise, funds generated inter-
nally are considered as equity for this purpose.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(c) DBP will take steps adequate to protect itself against the foreign
exchange risk on its lending operations and guarantees.
8.        Project Supervision Guidelines.  It is the policy of DBP to:
(a) undertake systematic follow-up on the progress and operation of the
projects financed by it, in order to establish whether the actual develop-
ments correspond with the expectations and projections on the basis of which
the investment decision was made, and to keep DBP's management currently
informed of the project status so that it may take timely and appropriate
action. Accordingly, DBP requires its borrowers to submit regular period-
ical reports on the physical and financial progress of the project, and on
its operational and financial performance. Furthermore, projects are visited
at appropriate intervals to confirm the state of progress, to check on the
efficiency, organization and management of the project, and to discuss
problems of mutual concern with the borrower's management; and (b) maintain
close scrutiny of its accounts in arrears. Each individual account in
arrears is analyzed in detail at least once annually in order to identify the
causes for arrears and to determine the repayment capacity of the enterprise.
On the basis of this analysis, DBP's management takes appropriate measures
(including legal action), for collection, rescheduling, or restructuring of
the account.

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
Outline of Industrial Development Strategy for 1978-79
A. Large Industry Financing
1.        DBP will continue to endeavor to enhance both its qualitative and
quantitative contribution to the Philippine economy. During the Five-Year
Plan Period, 1978-82, DBP plans to provide financial assistance to industry
for P 7.7 billion, of which P 2.7 billion including P 1.2 billion in foreign
exchange, will be provided in 1978-79. DBP's industry development activities
in the two-year period, 1978-79, will be concentrated in the specific areas
outlined below.
Project Promotion and Resource Allocation
2.        DBP's industrial financing will cover a broad spectrum of the sizes
of enterprises with emphasis on relatively smaller and mnedium size enterprises.
3.        DBP will intensify its promotional role by providing maximum
possible encouragement to new entrepreneurs especially those located in the
economically disadvantaged regions of the country. Towards this end, DBP
will provide technical assistance in identification and development of new
investment opportunities in subsectors and regions not fully developed so
far.
4.        DBP will follow the industrial priorities plan for large projects
approved by the DBP Board on April 5, 1978, which dovetails with the develop-
ment program of the National Government. DBP would therefore focus on Board
of Investments and Philippine Overseas Construction Board approved projects
as the principal target market for DBP's financial assistance. Generally,
within these priorities those industries will be assisted which meet any or
all of the following economic criteria:
(a) Further development of the country's natural resources,
including the further processing of these resources.
(b) Beneficial impact on the balance of payment position of
the country either through exports of manufactured goods or
substitution of domestic production for imports in an efficient
way.
(c) Decentralization of industry out of the Metro-Manila Area by
increasing gradually the amount of loans outside Metro-Manila.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(d) Additional employment opportunities to the country's labor
force at a relatively lower capital investment cost.
5.        In its appraisal of projects, DBP will bring out the employment
impact of new projects and will consider the choice of labor-intensive
technology wherever possible. To the extent possible, DBP will finance
projects with capital investment per job created not exceeding $15,000.
Through its increased use of economic rates of return it will increase the
efficiency of resource use in industrial development. DBP will also maintain
close liaison with the Office of the President, the Central Bank, NEDA, the
Board of Investments, Philippine Overseas Construction Board, and other
government agencies, in ensuring that DBP's investments take place in line
with the overall Government strategy for the development of Philippine
industry.
Government Loans
6.        DBP will continue to make loans or investment at the Government's
behest when it considers such loans to be financially and economically
justified, according to its accepted investment criteria. Behest loans that
do not meet these criteria will have to be funded by the National Government
and handled by DBP on an agency basis.
Guarantees
7.        DBP will continue to issue guarantees where it considers this
method of financing to be appropriate. However, it will normally provide
guarantees as part of a loan/guarantee package rather than as a separate
means of assistance. In future, guarantees will be issued only on projects
that have been fully appraised by DBP, and meet its normal investment criteria
for project acceptance.
Resource Mobilization
8.        DBP will strongly endeavor to raise adequate resources from external
sources to meet the demand for such funds. Such sources will include the
IBRD and ADB, with additional amounts from commercial foreign exchange
borrowings. Projected borrowings from commercial sources over the two years
(1978-79) are about $400 million. DBP plans to mobilize domestic currency
resources amounting to P 1,440 million through issuance of its Countryside
Bills. In addition, to the extent possible, DBP will explore new sources of
mobilizing peso resources so as to reduce its dependence on Government
funds.

Staff Development
9.        DBP will continue to improve its program for its staff handling
large industrial loans. This will be done by continuing to send senior staff
to courses both overseas and in the Philippines and by instituting its own
Industrial Evaluation Course, which will be available to appraisal and
supervision staff handling industrial loans.
B. Small and Medium Industries (SMI) Development Program
10.       Cognizant of the high economic merits of its SMI development
program, DBP plans to provide financing amounting to E 344 million to about
1,000 SMI projects over the next two years, 1978-79. The following strategy
will be followed while implementing the SMI financing target so as to achieve
a maximum development target.
Improvement in Institutional Set-Up
11.       DBP will constantly review the organization set up and staff
resources of IPD II and the Branches and will take necessary measures to make
them fully responsive to the needs of the SMI sector and more efficient in
handling SMI projects. To the extent possible efforts will be made to keep
the SMI loan processing time within 60 days in the Branches and IPD II.
12.       With a view to encouraging maximum utilization of existing SMI
productive capacity, DBP will enhance its working capital financing. Applica-
tions for only working capital loans will be entertained not only from export-
oriented projects but also from domestic market-oriented projects. DBP will
also ensure that benefits of its liberal policies concerning repayment term,
grace period, collateral requirement and sponsors' equity contributions are
passed on to its SMI clients within the limits of prudent: financial and
banking practices.
13.       In order to ensure that DBP's SMI investment will generate the
expected economic benefits, DBP will upgrade and intensiEy loan supervision
efforts of IPD II as well as the Branches with emphasis on preventive rather
than problem solving approach. IPD II will closely monitor the performance
of the Branches in this regard and whenever needed will provide necessary
assistance/guidance through its Regional Assistance Units.
Investment Priorities
14.       For its SMI financing program DBP will devise and closely follow an
Investment Priorities Plan which would provide it a rational basis for
screening and selection of investment projects. In every case project
selection would be determined by the relative impact of investments in the
economy and the project's commercial profitability.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Resource Allocation Criteria
15.       In order to ensure optimum economic benefits accrued to the economy
from its SMI financing, DBP shall follow closely the following strategies:
(a) Industry Dispersal. DBP's SMI financing in regions outside
Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon would account for at least 50%
of DBP's total SMI financing. DBP shall adopt a two-fold approach
for the attainment of this objective, enumerated as follows:
(i)  DBP has identified its key Branches which due to
potentialities of their regions, may provide the
lead for an accelerated regional growth of the SMI
sector. IPD II shall thus utilize its SMI Assistance
Unit to upgrade the capability and competence of these
branches to handle appraisal and supervision of these
projects to a reasonable level.
(ii)  IPD II considers industrial dispersal to be the long
term output of the Nationwide Industrial Estate
Program (NIEP) of the Government. It is for this
reason that for the current year, IPD II will identify
areas of cooperation and involvement with other Govern-
ment agencies relative to the setting up of industrial
estates in the various regions of the country as a key
element in the promotion of small and medium industries.
NIEP has to date identified thirty-seven (37) industrial
parks (exclusive of the mini-industrial estate now under
construction in Dagat-dagatan, Tondo). Based on the
implementation schedule to be set up by the Government,
DBP perceives to be involved in the program by (a) active
promotion of vacant industrial sites to IPD loan appli-
cants, coordination with the agency in charge of the
estate and continuing liaisons with both parties; and
(b) extension of loan facilities to colonizers of
industrial estates.
(b)  Utilization of Local Raw Materials and Energy Conservation.  These
are twin approaches linking areas of vital national concern to the
DBP's SMI programs. Adaptability to use of indigenous raw materials,
as a logistical consequence of regional dispersal, will remain a
criterion for qualifying as an SMI project within the purview of the
DBP's SMI programs. Energy conservation, while not previously
given due emphasis, is now believed worthy of inclusion among the
main thrusts of DBP's SMI programs. Staff studies are presently
underway and will be completed towards the formulation of lending
programs which should provide due cognizance and incentives for
the attainment of these objectives within the context of DBP's
existing lending programs. For this purpose, IPD II will consider
a package of incentives for projects which are either users of
indigenous raw materials and projects associated with energy
conservation.

(c) Export Promotions, DBP intends to adopt a more assertive role
in promoting export consciousness and undertaking export liaison
work in 1978-79. As the joint responsibility of the supervision
group and plans and programs unit, the Bank's persuasive influence
shall be used to promote membership of mortgagor projects in export
confederations or chambers. Other promotional efforts include
provision of export directives and liaison between the small
producers and the prominent export trading concerns. Under the
program, DBP shall also promote subcontracting arrangements among
exporters and entrepreneur producers whenever feasible. Subcontrac-
ting scheme is envisioned to be strategy for the creation of job
opportunities at a lower capital investment per job. Indirectly,
this will assist the DBP's SMI projects by providing them with the
necessary marketing support. The concept of the program revolves
around DBP granting financial support as well as indirect marketing
assistance to SMI projects financed. A comprehensive policy for
DBP's Board approval for the special financing program to export
traders will be submitted in the first half of 1978.
(d) Promotion of Labor-Intensive Industries. With DBP's SMI lending
program veering away from capital intensive industries, generation
of about 15,000 jobs at a capital to labor ratio of P 27,000:1 is
considered to be one of DBP's targets for 1978-79. To be guided
by an Investment Priorities Listing of projects to be set up,
IPD II anticipates to be more selective in making investments in
1978-79. Towards this end, efforts have been already initiated
by DBP to encourage some of the DBP-financed contracting basis
to promising entrepreneurs. The Dagat-dagatan mini-industrial
estate in Tondo was initially identified to provide the base to
support the subcontracting scheme. Projects which are basically
labor-intensive, such as garments or handicrafts manufacturing for
export, shall be the principal target in the strategy. DBP shall
then provide the necessary financial support both to the DBP-borrower
and the subcontractor.
C. Technical Assistance to Smaller Financial Institutions
16.       DBP will accelerate its efforts to upgrade thes operational capability
of smaller development finance institutions in the country (such as private
development banks). As a first step in this direction ]DBP will set up a
Development Training Institute to impart professional training to the management
and staff of the said development finance institutions. Simultaneously, DBP
will increase its financial assistance for PDBs and will continue to help
promote and set up new PDBs in the country especially in regions outside
Luzon.

/a  Accounts for FY77 are audited only up to December 31, 1976.  DBP shifted its accounting
year (effective January 1977) from fiscal year to calendar year basis and, therefore,
prepared its six-monthly interim accounts for July-December 1976, which were audited.
For realistic comparison, the income statement summarized here covers a one-year period
from July 1976 to June 1977.

Assumptions
1.  Approvals - The projected approvals for July-December 1977 are based on the actual pipeline of projects as of June 30, 1977.  The lower
projected approvals level in CY1978  than in CY1977 reflects constrains on DBP's domestic resources, slack in business conditions and
effects of DBP's massive collection drive. Approvals for CY79 through 82 are based on the expected growth potentials of each sector.
2.  Commitments - 75% of loan approvals are assumed to be committed in the same year and the remaining 25% in the following year.  These ratios
reflect DBP's actual past experience.
3. Disbursements - are based on the closing dates of the respective credit loans, the nature and requirement of projects, and past pattern of
DBP's disbursements.
