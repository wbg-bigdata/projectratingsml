MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Bangladesh - Fi*th
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1440-BD)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Bangladesh - Fifth Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 1440-BD) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office, with Part II prepared by the
Borrower.
The principal objectivts of this project were to prepare a variety of policy and project-
related studies, to strengthen Bangladeshi institutions (including those managing technical
assistance) and to strengthen the local consulting industry.
The PCR acknowledges that the project 'did not fulfill entirely the objectives set out for it,"
as suggested by the fact that about 25 percent of the credit was canceled notwithstanding four one-
year extensions of the closing date. The PCR finds the project's institutional development (ID)
impact to have been only partial but concludes that overall project performance was satisfactory
because 'the project's primary goal of providing funds to assist in investment project preparation
and implementation was met." It also concludes that the benefits will be sustainable.
The PCR, however, does not provide adequate coverage or analysis of the strengths and
wveaknesses of project design and implementation, and it overlooks the emphasis given in the
President's Report to the objectives of ID, training, and the strengthening of the local consulting
industry. OED's reading of the write-ups of the 41 sub-projects (see Annex to the PCR) suggests
that the project impact on these ID fronts was negligible rather than partial, with few sustainable
benefits.
For example, one of the project covenants called for the Government to prepare, by
September 30, 1984 a program to strengthen the local consulting industry and "implement it
promptly thereafter." In the event, the study was not produced until June 1991 and no
implementation took place before the project's closing.
Notwithstanding the utility of many of the studies produced, therefore, the overall project
performance is ratef1 as unsatisfactory and the sustainability as uncertain.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
FIFTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Cr. 1440-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Technical
Assistance Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 1440-RD in the amount of SDR
23.8 million (US$ 25.0 million) was approved by the Board on February 2, 1984 and
signed between the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and IDA (the Association) on
February 24, 1984. After four one-year extensions to the original Closing Date,
the project closed on June 30, p992. However, the Credit account remained open
through October 31, 1992. After the final disbursement on November 10, 1992, a
total amount of SDR 18,046,644 (US$25,987,167) had been spent, and an undisbursed
balance of SDR 5,753,356 was canceled.
This PCR was jointly prepared by the Institutional Development Unit of
the Asia Technical Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and
by the Borrower (Part II) after receiving Parts I and III. The report is based
on the President's Report (No. P-3705), the Development Credit Agreement, project
briefs, supervision reports, annual reports on implementation, financial
statements, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

FIFTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Cr. 1440-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
ObJectives
i.       The principal objectives of the Fifth Technical Assistance (TA V)
project (Credit 1440-BD) were: (a) to provide foreign exchange for technical
assistance (TA) required for project preparation and implementation and for
studies required for the formulation of economic and sector policies; (b) to
assist in improving the capacity of Government agencies to prepare and implement
development projects; (c) to improve the management and coordination of TA within
Government agencies; and (d) to encourage the strengthening of the local
consulting industry.
Implementation Experience
ii.      This Credit was the Fifth Bank Group Technical Assistance operation in
Bangladesh.   Due to the delay of the TA IV project, the project was a slow
starter. TA IV was only fully committed and closed on April 31, 1986.   No
commitments were approved under TA V until July 1986, more than two years after
Credit Effectiveness. Meanwhile, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) introduced
a new and explicit policy guideline under which GOB agencies were required to
seek grant financing (as opposed to loans) for technical assistance prior to
applying for the use of Credit funds.   The latter action proved to be a
disincentive to agencies to apply for resources for project preparation, studies
and institutional development TA from TA V. These strict GOB policies together
with cumbersome procedures contributed to slow utilization of the funds and
implementation of the subprojects during the period 1984-89. Therefore, as a
pre-condition to the second extension of the closing date in June 1989, an Action
Program was agreed upon between GOB and IDA designed to accelerate the
utilization of the Credit. This--together with more favorable policies adopted
by the new Government (1991), concerted efforts made by the Project Implementa-
tion Unit at the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and intensified supervision
by IDA--led to full commitment of the funds and a greater rate of disbursement
in the final year. Nonetheless, disbursement delays persisted and resulted in
the eventual cancellation of almost 251 of the Credit.
Results
iii.     Overall, the project did not fulfill entirely the objectives set out for
it due to reasons given above. However, the project has provided an important,
relatively flexible and complementary funding source for freestanding TA, e.g.,
studies and institutional inputs, especially in terms of more rapid and flexible
approval processes, which allowed quickly emerging requirements for additional
financing of preparation of investment projects (e.g. Jamuna Bridge) and filling



-iii-
unforeseen Saps in implementation TA to be met. The results of the 39 individual
subprojects are mixed. Generally, however, the overall impact of the Project was
positive and TA funded under the project has led (or will lead) to large-scale
investments by IDA and other donors in a wide range of sectors, thus representing
a major contribution to the public investment program.
Sustainability
iv.       The basis for continued dialogue on the issues concerning project
preparation and institutional development tand its sustainability) was created
during the implementation of TA V. In addition, and partly as a result of this
dialogue, the Government has begun to streamline its policies in regard to the
design and implementation of TA and will continue to do so during the implementa-
tion of TA VI. It is not always possible to accurately gauge the long-term
institution building effects of such projects immediately following their
closure.   In mobt cases, the major part of the institutional work has been
carried out during implementation of subsequent IDA investment projects, since
many of the subprojects were preparatory in nature and required foreign and local
consultants' expertise.   Nonethelebs, it would appear that there have been
institutional gains which can and will be sustained with continuing IDA/GOB
commitment.
Findings and Lessons Learned
V.       It is always difficult to improve the performance of a Technical
Assistance project, if favorable national TA policies are not in place. Although
much lip service has been paid to the need for strong government commitment to
T A Projects and their participation as partners in their design and implementa-
tion, in practice this has often been ignored. If such projects are to succeed,
it is important to remember that they really are vital to the success of TA and
should be verified and insisted on before launching any new TA project. In
addition, new TA projects should not be launched prematurely while the funds of
previous projects have not been fully utiized. Otherwise, mobilization could
well be delayed.

Project Name          s Fifth Technical Assistance Project
Credit Number         : 1440-BD
Vice President Unit   : South Asia Region
Country               s People's Republic of Bangladesh
Sector                t Technical Assistance
Background
1.       The environw-t for economic d4evelopment in Bangladesh has long been
recognized as particularly demanding. Although the country has made progress in
recent years, the limited resource base, the extreme poverty of the rapidly
expanding population, the underdeveloped physical and social infrastructure and
the vulnerability of the economy to climatic setbacks have made the process of
development extremely difficult.
2.       Firstly, the limited capacity of institutions throughout the public
sector has served to hamper progress in some instances. The capacity of many GOB
institutions to manage their affairs efficiently is still limited, a constraint
recognized by tie Government itself. In many cases, its national administration
had (and has) to be improvised as subprojects were being implemented. It is
against this background that extensive external technical assistance is
continuously needed.
3.       Secondly, Bangladesh is highly dependent on external assistance for its
economic and social development. Foreign aid disbursements have corresponded to
almost 85Z of public investment during recent years. On average, 9Z of overall
aid flows have been devoted to different forms of technical assistance (TA),
whether for project preparation and implementation, for institutional develop-
ment, for training, or for other purposes. In addition to the TA components of
the 155 investment, S?CAL, SAL and Program projects approved since the country's
independence in 1972, IDA has provided funding of US$62.5 million to the
Government (TA I - TA V) for TA activities in cases where financing was not
readily available on appropriate terms or where IDA financing would permit more
expeditious action. Other major sources of TA financing have been the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), bilateral donors and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).
4.       In order to encourage progress, GOB launched the Second Five-Year
National Plan for FY81-85 (the Plan). Priority issues addressed in the Plan were



-2-
foodgrain production, education, population, rural poverty and unemployment,
energy and industry and development administration. In the area of development
administration, the critical needs were tos (a) strengthen the capacity s.or
policy formulation and project implementetion; (b) streamline administrative
procedures; and (c) improve decision-making ;rocesses. Recognizing that local
government bodies could play an effective role in the development effort, the
Government decided to decentralize a number of planning and administrative
functions  to  the Thana  (Sub-District)  level.    Accordingly,  sub-district
administrations have been reorganized sad strengthened to enable them to take on
most development activities at the local level. (After the new government took
office in March 1991, it undertook an ambitious development program and had taken
further steps to revitalize the economy. A major requirement in this regard was
to improve the utilization of donor assistance, as slow project implementation
in recent years has resulted in a growth of the pipeline of outstanding aid
commitment to US$5.8 billion by mid-1991.)
5.       IDA's lending for TA has proven to be a useful source of finance for a
broad range of TA activities.   The "freestanding" TA credits have helped to
advance the implementation of at least 21 TDA projects with credit amountLs
totaling over US$621 million.   IDA's lending for TA has made a significant
contribution to the preparation of high-priority development projects and to
strengthening IDA's project pipeline in Bangladesh. This type of assistance is
essential to allow Bangladesh to undertake its immediate development programs.
It was against this background that TA V was appraised and approved.
Prolect Objectives and Description
6.       Credit 1440-BD was a follow-up to Credit 1124-3D (TA IV), and was
similar to the previous four TA projects in its objectives. These weres
(a) to provide foreign exchange for TA required for project preparation and
implementation and for studies required for the formulation of economic
and sector policies;
(b) to assist in improving the capacity of Government agencies to prepare
and implement development projects;
(c) to improve the management and coordination of TA within Government
agencies; and
(d) to encourage the strengthening of the local consulting industry.
7.       Underlining the immediate objectives was the longer term objective of
strengthening Bangladesh's capacity for planning, project preparation and
implementation.  Thus, about a third of the subprojects identified at the time
of Board approval had, as their primary objective, institution building and staff
training, and it was explicitly required that consultants' terms of reference for
most of the remaining subprojects would emphasize the training of counterpart
staff. In parallel, the Government was to be encouraged to develop systematic
training programs for staff responsible for planning, project preparation and
implementation.
8.       Based on its principal objective, high priority projects were selected
in line with Government's economic plan and IDA's lending strategy in the



-3-
country. In all, 30Y subprojects were approved during the project.  Further
details regarding these subprojects are given in the Annex.
Pro1ect Design and Organization
91       IDA has proviAed five TA Credits to GOB and the conceptual foundation
for TA V is similar to the previous four TA projects. And it was intended that
funds would be approved for subprojects that met one of the following mutually
agreed criteria which were set out in Schedule I of the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA):
(a) a feasibility study or other investigation required for preparing
projects suitable for financing by the association or ot'her external
financing agencies (with priority given to studies of projects believed
likely to be suitable for consideration for financing by the Associa-
tion);
(b) a program to strengthen institutions in Bangladesh responsible for
project planning and implementation;
(c) a study to provide information required for the selection of specific
projects for implementation, or for improvement of overall economic
planning; or
(d) a program of training and assistance to local consulting firms, under
terms and conditions (including the on-lending terms) satisfactory of
the Association.
10.      The project design was based on the experiences and results of the
previous TA projects. It was estimated that there would be about 30 subprojects
under this credit, as, eventually, there were. However, due to the delays in
completing TA IV, as noted above ±2 subprojects were carried over from TA IV and
included  in Subproject No. 1.   Thus, there were actually 41 subprojects
altogether. Considering the delays in the implementation of TA IV, the appraisal
and approval of TA V appears to have been premature. For the first two years
following the approval of TA V, no disbursements were made because there were
still available funds under TA IV, and the Closing Date for TA IV was extended
by a year (fror. April 30, 1985 to April 30, 1986) to allow for full disbursement
of the Credit.   TA V, having been approved in February 1984 and declared
effective in April 1984, was to suffer unnecessary delays due to this overlap.
11.      At the time of the project's design, there were three organizations
which normally deal with TA in Bangladesh: the Planning Commission, the External
Resource Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and the relevant
line ministry or agency involved in subproject implementation. The Planning
Commission was (and is) responsible for appraising the TA and assuring that it
conforms to the national development plan, while ERD has the primary responsibil-
ity for liaison with foreign aid donors. Besides initiating the request, the
J  Subproloct No. 1 consisted of 12 subproJectu carried over from TA IV. Thus, there were
actually 41 subprojects under TA V. SubproJect No. 1, comprising the carryovers, accounted
for disbursements of SDR 8,M3S,109.



-4-
line ministry or agency has the responsibility for recruiting consultants,
providing counterpart staff and logistics support, undertaking supervision, and
utilizing the results of the TA when it is approved.
12.      By agreement between IDA and GOB, ERD was to have overall responsibility
for the coordination and impiementation of the project.  This included reviewing
requests from line ministries and operating agencies for use of TA funds and
forwarding to IDA those suitable for financing under the proposed credit. ERD
was also to monitor the subprojects and assist in providing advice to implement-
ing agencies about contracting consulting services, and related equipment and
disbursement procedures. ERD was to provide periodic overall status reports on
the progress of the project. Finally, within ERD, a Project Director was to be
designated to coordinate administration. All the above roles and responsibili-
ties for the project were clearly stated in the DCA, and were fully agreed by
both IDA and GOB.
13.      The day-to-day work of coordinating project activities was done by the
World Bank TA Cell, manned by a Project Director (Deputy Secretary), a Deputy
Director and the necessary support staff.   The Cell was also involved in
coordinating other IDA investment projects and as main counterpart to IDA. The
Cell was responsible for (a) processing of the GOB approvals of subprojects upon
recelpt of requests by agencies, (b) acting as the main contact channel to IDA
in obtaining approvals, (c) internally supervising the progress of the subproject
implementation, (d) reporting to IDA, and (e) facilitating IDA's supervision of
the entire project.
14.      This  project  design  helped,  somewhat,  to  alleviate  the  delays
experienced under the earlier projects and streamlined the implementation. In
fact, the active role adopted by the World Bank Cell proved to be a significant
contribution to achieving the full commitment of the Credit, especially in the
last years of Effectiveness. Nonetheless, the centralized approval authority
previously exercised by the President's office for all TA credit funds, and the
cumbersome TA processing procedures within GOB were still considered to be causes
for concern.
Proiect Implementation
15.      The project was implemented over a period of eight years, including four
one-year extensions of the Closing Date (originally June 30, 1988) due to a
delayed beginning and slow utilizatioi of available funds. Each subproject was
implemented according to the timetable agreed upon at subproject approval. From
the time of the second extension, in June 1989, an Action Program was launched
whereby GOB committed itself to full commitment of the Credit as quickly as
possible and to accelerated implementation of the subproject program.   This
notably increased the use of the funds, especially after the adoption by GOB of
the new TA policy. One hundred percent of the Credit funds were committed to 30
subprojects at the time of Credit closing on June 30, 1992. At the time of
Credit Account Closing on October 31, 1992, a total of SDR 18,046,644 had been
disbursed (75.8 Z). Fourteen subprojects approved under TA V have been carried
over to TA VI on the condition that the amounts allocated will be for a period
of one year only.



-5-
Prolect Results
16.      The achievement of the project's major objectives was mixed. As noted
above, almost one fourth of the proceeds of the Credit were eventually cancelled
due to the slow commitment of the Credit by the Government.   Had the more
flexible 'LA policy recently adopted by GOB been in effect during project
implementation, commitments and disbursements would have been done more quickly.
Despite ti- delays in implementation, however, the project's primary goal of
providing fonds to assist in investment project preparation and implementation
was met. The funds made available from the Credit contributed to the preparation
of several IDA financed investment projects (see attached subproject descrip-
tions).  Without this support, the PIP would have faced serious delays and
quality deficiencies.
17.      In the area of capacity improvement and institution building within the
Government agencies, the results are less clear.  Certainly the GOB policies
wh'-h were, in part, responsible for the delays in project Implementation also
served as an impediment to achieving these objectives.   Nonetheless, more
intensive dialogue between IDA and GOB staff, and the willingness of the
Government to review its policies as a result, have led to improved capacity and
a clearer focus on the training and institutional changes required to further
streamline the TA approval process. And, while the institutional development
objectives were secondary in importance to the PIP, certain of these are being
undertaken as priority issues under the Sixth TA Project.
Prolect Sustainability
18.      the project was designed to assist with project preparation and
institutional developmient. The major part of the project funding went towards
technically involved feasibility and engineering studies, for which local
expertise was not available. However, local consultants were used widely in
conjunction with foreign ones. The transfer of knowbow achieved in this manner
was instrumental in increasing the level of local expertise. Indeed, GOB has
taken steps to foster such cooperation.   It is true that the hoped for
development aspects were not fully met during project implementation. However,
the bases for a continuing dialogue on the issues and their sustainability was
created. This dialogue will be pursued during the implementation of TA VI.
IDA's Performance
19.      The project was identified and prepared during supervision of TA IV.
Possibly as a result, insufficient attention was paid to the relationship of the
ongoing implementation of TA IV and the institution of GOB policies which were
inimical to TA V's success. The amount of supervision varied over the eight
years of project implementation, from as much as 20 staffweeks in FY85 to as few
as 3.6 staffweeks in FY86. This uneven supervision effort may have had some
causal effect in project performance. Insufficient attention was given to the
preparation  and  supervision  of  freestanding  institutional  development
subprojects. Generally though, and certainly in the later years, the Bank's
performance must be considered good.

Borrower Performance
20.      In addition to the Borrower's responsibilities mentioned above, GOB also
agreed to carry out a study on the appropriate institutional arrangements for
coordination, management and effective utilization of technical assistance and
to furnish the Association with findings of the study by December 31, 1984. GOB
also agreed to establish and implement standard procedures for the negotiation
of consultants' contracts by June 30, 1984. Finally, it was to prepare a program
to strengthen the local consulting industry by September 30, 1984. Its inception
was delayed but a study was completed during 1990 and implementation of the
program will continue under TA VI.
21.      Implementation of the project was considerably delayed, due to policies
adopted by GOB during implementation, which made it difficult for agencies to
seek financing for TA from non-grant sources. This caused line agencies to be
reluctant to apply for the use of funds from TA V. This combined with lengthy
approval procedures and guidelines adopted by ERD and Planning Commission, and
as the final step, the President's office as ultimate approval authority,
exacerbated the delays. Despite efforts of the ERD World Bank TA Cell, very slow
progress was made until the introduction of the Action Program in June 1989. The
Borrower's performance after this improved considerably, which is directly
reflected in the improved commitment and disbursement levels during the final
years.
Proiect RelationshiD
22.      The project contributed directly to major investments and to their
implementation through the provision of TA. In addition, desirable cross-effects
were achieved in several freestanding TA subprojects. e.g., at the policy level.
Altogether, several agencies were involved in the implementation of the
subproject.   Relations between GOB and IDA varied over time but must be
considered to have been essentially fruitful in that lessons learned from the
implementation of TA V have resulted in the GOB decision to revert to earlier
approval procedures for TA projects applied during TA III and IV. This will
result in faster, more efficient processes and facilitate the timely implementa-
tion of the GOB !ivestment program.
Consulting Service
23.      Most consultants fulfilled their assignments on schedule, except in one
case under Subproject No. 01-017 (Power Rehabilitation and Distribution) due to
the disagreement with the implementing line agency. However, in most cases,
delays were encountered in the consultant selection and procurement processes.
Lessons Learned
24.      The improvements in subproject design and processing which took place
toward the end of this project indicate partial success. They also demonstrate
that favorable national TA policies and streamlined processing guidelines are
among the key factors behind the success of TA projects in Bangladesh.   If
properly designed, freestanding TA projects, which normally remain sources of
last resort for the provision of TA, can serve as a focal point to assist in
improving these two factors.   However,  the Government's policies and its
commitment to actually use the Credit funds should be confirmed, since GOB



-7-
perceives Credits to be more expensive and prefers to utilize grant funds for TA.
Therefore, the actual requirement for IDA funds should be verified before
proceeding to provide them.   The need for an untied funding source with
flexibility and sufficient resources for pre-investment work is among the issues
reviewed in this process.
25.      A new project should not be launched prematurely while the funds of the
previous project have not been fully utilized. Disbursements under this Project
did not commence until two years after Effectiveness, contrary to original plans,
partly because of the delays in the commitment of funds under the previous
project. At least two credit extensions can be attributed to this fact.
26.      Timely  implementation  of  freestanding  TA  projects  require  prior
identification of a major subproject program prior to project appraisal. Only
an illustrative list of subprojects existed at the time of the launching of this
project. Lessons learned In this project, as well as within various similar
freestanding IDA TA projects, suggest that part of the funds should be earmarked
to activities already identified during project preparation, and which can be
initiated during the first year of project effectiveness.
27.      The Bank's task managers were often reluctant to make use of TA V
because of the cumbersome approval processes involved, at least prior to 1991.
Instead, if other gra.lt sources were not available, they preferred to utilize
unused TA portions of ongoing IDA credits which could be mobilized quickly and
would not involve a separate approval process.
28.      From 1987 onwards, Credit funds were only available for subprojects
which were due to be completed prior to Credit Closing, in effect, within one
year. Numerous prospective subprojects therefore became ineligible for funding
although they were acceptable otherwise. In the future, extensions should be
based on credible action plans presented by the Borrower and acceptable to IDA
and to be implemented within a defined period, but not necessarily limited to one
year.
29.      Freestanding TA projects, having many subprojects all of which are being
implemented under varying timetables, require close attention to performance
audits, for the subprojects and for the project as a whole. In many cases, under
TA V, audit information was long delayed or not available, which resulted in
incomplete subproject monitoring. In part to address this situation, the GOB
audit process is undergoing reorganization, a process partly supported under TA
VI.
30.      The President's Report and DCA set out the criteria for subproject
selection under the Credit, and the DCA served as a guide to both IDA and GOB in
the selection process. Since most subprojects were related to IDA investment
projects, separate project documentation (with the exception of consultants' TORs
and contracts) was not normally available for TA V. However, ERD held semi-
annual project review meetings with the implementing agencies and prepared
progress reports which were made available to supervision missions and the Bank's
Resident Mission in Bangladesh. These reports were, in turn, forwarded to the
managing divisions within the Bank responsible for individual subprojects.

FIFTH TECENICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Cr. 1440-BD)
PART II - PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN - TEE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVEI/
Prolect Formulation
31.      With the increasing rate of commitments under the four previous TA
credits and the build-up of a pipeline of TA Subprojects, the Governhant of
Bangladesh started dialogue with the World Bank on the possibility of a Fifth TA
Credit. The discussions were held as part of the on-going supervision efforts
and consequently no formal pre-appraisal or full appraisal missions were
considered necessary. Preparation of Fifth Technical Assistance Project started
in early 1983 and discussions were held with World Bank during the supervision
missions of TA-IV in June and November 1983. Negotiations for TA-V were held in
Washington, D.C. during the mon.h of February, 1984.
Proiect Obiectives and Descriptions
32.      The immediate objective of TA-V was similar to that of the earlier four
TA credits namely to provide an assured and flexible source of foreign exchange
for technical assistance activities in cases where other financing is not readily
available, or where IDA financing would expedite preparation of projects eligible
for IDA consideration. Funds would be used for the preparation of high priority
projects and for technical assistance and training programs designed to
strengthen institutions responsible for project identification, preparation and
implementation or for the improvement of economic planning. Underlying the
immediate objective was the long term objective of strengthening Bangladesh's
capacity for project preparation and implementation. The Government has often
stated its perspective on TA as an instrument for bringing about a transfer of
technology and for training its staff, so that ultimately its need for
conventional TA is eliminated. However, for lack of a clear authoritative focus
for TA, the Government has not been able to translate its perspective into
effective policies.   The Bank's TA projects, therefore, continue to play an
important role until such time when local capacity is effectively increased.
33.      The amount of the credit (23.8 million SDR) was based on two main
considerations: (a) maintenance of the accelerated rate of commitment achieved
under TA-IV and (b) the intensified project preparation activity generated by the
Government's Third Five Year Plan. The administrative improvement introduced
under TA-IV (a Project Director under ERD and a more formalized consultation

procedure for sub-project approval) were to be continued.  As in TA-IV, the
project would finance 10OZ of all consultant services. In addition, the project
would finance foreign expenditures for equipment and materials, or for training
programs  associated  with  project  preparation  and  implementation.    The
Government's contribution to individual sub-project costs included the financing
of counterpart staff and support facilities--the provision of which was included
as an explicit condition of sub-project approval by IDA.
Proiect Performance
34.      Based on the main objectives mentioned above, only 30 priority projects,
all of which were in line with Government's Economic Plan, were considered for
financing under TA-V. In addition 12 sub-projects were carried over from TA-IV
for completion under TA-V. As such there were altogether 41 sub-projects under
TA-V. Although TA-V was approved in February 1984 and made effective in April
1984, the preceding TA-IV credit was extended up to April 1986 to facilitate full
disbursement. This overlap resulted in initial delay in the implementation of
TA-V credit. Out of the total credit amount of SDR 23.8 million an amount of SDR
18.05 million (approximately) has been disbursed and the balance amount of SDR
5.75 million (approximately) was cancelled. This shows that about 75.82 of the
credit was disbursed and remaining 24.2Z of the credit was cancelled due to slow
comimitment. The main reason for slow commitment from TA-V credit was that grant
search for TA projects was obligatory and the credit funds for TA projects could
be used only as a last resort if grant was not available and further that
procedures and formalities required to be followed in processing and approval of
the TA projects were also quite complicated and time consuming.
Conclusion
35.      In view of the experience stated above the necessity for stream-lining
TA project processing procedure was urgently felt by the Government and
accordingly simplified TA guidelines were prepared in May, 1992 in consultation
with the donors. The new guidelines are being followed now and it is expected
that in view of the revised and simplified TA guidelines the overall efficiency
in processing, approval and implementation of the TA sub-projects under the
ongoing TA-VI credit will be greatly improved.

GOB was required (Section 4.05 (c) of the DCA) to provide timely audits
of each subproject. Compliance largely lagged, but audit reports were received.
However, due to a Regional decision to cease monitoring these audit requirements
through the Audit Report Compliance System (ARCS), exact information is lacking.
Section 4.06 of the DCA required GOB to carry out a study on the
coordination, management and utilization of TA by December 1984. This was
completed in June 1985.
Section 4.07 of the DCA required that GOB establish standard procedures
for the employment of consultants by June 1984. This was completed in June 1985.
Section 4.08 required GOB to prepare a program to strengthen the local
consulting industry by September 1984. This was finally completed in June 1991.

objectives
The subproject was to conduct a feasibility study on flood control,
drainage and carry out irrigation schemes in the greater districts of
Mymensingh, Xhulna, Jessore, Comilla, Patuakhali, Sylget and Raishahi covering
about 116,000 acres.
The consultants were to prepare feasibility studies for 10
slibprojects under a proposed sector investment credit that would include 30-40
subprojects. Following completion of the feasibility studies, the consultants
were to work on detailed design.
Implementation
This subproject was transferred from TA IV for final payments. A
first contract was signed between Bangladesh Water Development Board and PRC
Engineering Consultants International in October 1982. Work began in December
1982 and was completed in December 1983. The second phase of the subproject
was contracted in October 1984 and the work was completed in November 1985.
It is being held by disputes between the consultant and BWDB. The latter
claims that the final report did not contain comments made by the consultant.
The remaining amount may be cancelled.
Follow-up Activities
The subproject assisted in the preparation of BWDB Small Schemes
Project (Credit 1467-BD). Construction supervision was cofinanced by UNDP, and
finalized under this credit (Subproject No. 025).

ObJectives
The program was expected to lead to wide-ranging reforms and
improvements in all aspects of trade and industrial policy affecting the
private sector through:
1. Policy studies;
2. Promotion-cum-planning activities; and
3. Strengthening institutions involved in industrial development
in Bangladesh.
Implementation
This subproject was transferred from TA IV in order to finalize the
two remaining components. Work was completed in November 1987.
Follow-up Activities
New subproject was opened in December 1987 to continue with
additional activities.
Evaluation
The subproject was valuable in facilitating the partial removal of
import controls and lowering of tariff rates under a program supported by an
Industrial Sector Credit (adjustment lending). The institution building
aspect was not well sustained, however, and a new initiative was required in
1990-1992 in connection with a second ISAC.

Evaluation
Performance of the consultants was poor in the view of both GOB and
IDA. Also, BSEC had mixed feelings about the TA objectives and did not
provide satisfactory support. The company's restructuring was not successful
and the joint venture proposal by the Belgians was found unacceptable, thus
not leading to the desired privatization of BMTF.

Obiectives
The objectives of component under TA V were to repair rural and
urban roads damaged by the 1987 and 1988 floods and to promote rural develop-
ment through reconstruction.
Implementation
The workers have suffered considerable delays due to managerial
difficulties by local contractors. Most works are now complete, and the final
17 budgets will be completed in June 1993.
Follow-up Activities
The subproject was carried over to TA VI in order to complete the
remaining works.
Evaluation
Very partial review of works indicates that there have been
serious depressions in quality of works completed. The performance of the
(Local) supervision consultants in reporting progress and quality of works has
been unsatisfactory. Experience indicates that there needs to be some
expatriate responsibility for such services (as was the case for the RHD
component).
