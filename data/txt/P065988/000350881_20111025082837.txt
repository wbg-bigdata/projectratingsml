Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

   1. Estimates suggest that Mexico harbors more than 10 percent of the planet’s
      biological diversity. Technical reports indicate that Mexico is the country in the
      Americas with the highest diversity of ecosystems, and that it is a key center of
      origin of agricultural crops. Yet, Mexico’s high biodiversity had been constantly
      threatened by deforestation, over-exploitation, uncontrolled tourism, accelerated
      economic development and arbitrary settlement policies. Mexico has lost more
      than 95 percent of its humid tropical forests and more than half of its temperate
      forests, as well as more than half of the original cover of arid areas. In response
      to threats to its biodiversity, the Government of Mexico (GOM) in the late 1980s
      developed a strategy for protecting critical habitats that included as a key element
      the creation of the National System of Protected Natural Areas (SINAP)
      comprising parks, reserves and monuments, in 1986. SINAP was designed to: (a)
      preserve natural settings; (b) safeguard genetic diversity; (c) ensure rational
      utilization of ecosystems; (d) provide areas conducive to scientific research; (e)
      promote rational and sustained resource utilization and preservation; (f) establish
      forest zones to protect human activities in mountainous flood zone regions, and


                                           10
          (g) protect cultural heritage. The creation of the National Commission for
          Protected Areas (CONANP) in June 2000 elevated and strengthened the
          institutional management of SINAP. At the time of appraisal of the Consolidation
          of the Protected Areas System Project (the Project or SINAP II) in 2001, Mexico
          had established 127 Protected Areas (PAs), totaling 17,056,606 hectares, of which
          12,949,170 hectares were terrestrial and 4,107,435 hectares were marine areas.

      2. In the early 1990s, the GOM and the World Bank began to explore how the Bank
         could assist in supporting the country’s environmental objectives. A US$25
         million Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant was approved in 1992 to
         support the conservation of ten PAs in Mexico under a Natural Protected Areas
         Project1. Following a difficult start to implementation resulting from changes to
         that project’s implementation arrangements and complicated disbursement
         arrangements, the newly created Secretaría de Medio Ambiente, Recursos
         Naturales y Pesca (Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries,
         SEMARNAP) that had become responsible for implementation and the Bank
         decided to restructure the project. A detailed analysis of the project carried out by
         a prominent Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), followed by an extensive
         consultation process that involved different groups with experience in PA
         management, recommended that the then remaining funds under the grant
         (US$16.48 million) be transferred to an endowment fund that would be
         established and managed by a private organization to ensure long-term support to
         the ten priority PAs, as well as slowly build the planning and spending capacity of
         the personnel at the PAs. The Consejo Nacional de ?reas Naturales Protegidas
         (National Council for Natural Protected Areas, CNANP), an advisory body
         created by SEMARNAP, composed of members of all sectors of society (social,
         private, academic, NGOs) and considered the highest advising authority on PAs,
         recommended that the PA endowment be entrusted to the Fondo Mexicano para
         la Conservación de la Naturaleza (Mexican Nature Conservation Fund, FMCN),
         an established organization with experience in managing environmental funds that
         was then supporting 380 conservation projects in Mexico. The restructuring of
         the Natural Protected Areas Project resulted in the creation of the Fondo para
         ?reas Naturales Protegidas (Protected Areas Fund, FANP) within FMCN, along
         with several organizational, institutional and operational changes that were
         designed to improve PA management.

      3. The restructured Natural Protected Areas Project (the SINAP I Project or SINAP
         I) began implementation in 1998 and soon became a model project. A GEF study
         on environmental funds throughout the world identified the FMCN and the newly
         created FANP as model funds; an independent evaluation of the project confirmed
         this finding. Both identified the mixed public-partnership structure as a key
         aspect of its success. There were other positive developments at the time. The



1
    Mexico Natural Protected Areas (GEF) Project, Project ID P052209, approved on June 4, 1997.



                                                    11
        public funds channeled by the GOM to the PA system had increased 15-fold from
        1994 to 2000. Also, within the conservation community, FMCN had almost
        doubled its endowment, and had assumed the leadership of the Network on
        Environmental Funds of Latin America and the Caribbean. NGOs in conservation
        in Mexico had succeeded in recognizing the establishment of private natural lands,
        developing local fundraising mechanisms, designing regional approaches to
        conservation and innovating through new community group based conservation
        schemes. More importantly, support for PAs had not only survived a change in
        Administration---the new Administration had embraced the protection of the
        SINAP as a national priority. The Implementation Completion Report for the
        SINAP I Project rated its outcome as Highly Satisfactory, its Sustainability as
        Highly Likely and its Institutional Development Impact as High, and reported:
        “This was an extraordinarily successful project, achieving not only the specific
        objectives elaborated in the project design, but also having positive impacts
        throughout the entire system of protected areas management in Mexico?2.

    4. With SINAP established, the GOM identified as a priority the consolidation of the
       system through full coverage of PAs with competent personnel and minimal
       infrastructure, the development of fundraising mechanisms, the implementation of
       innovative conservation mechanisms, a communication strategy to different
       sectors in society, adaptive management, and the development of local capacity
       and co-responsibility in communities and state government in the conservation of
       PAs. Continued GEF support, through a follow-on project, was seen as essential
       for sustaining and expanding these efforts.

    5. The Consolidation of the Protected Areas System Project (the Project, or SINAP
       II) was prepared and technically cleared for GEF Work Program entry in
       November 2000 as an eight-year project with a US$31.1 million contribution
       from the GEF to support 12 PAs under the Endowment Fund. However, in view
       of the severe funding constraints faced by GEF at the time, a phased approach
       was agreed whereby the US$16.1 allocation initially authorized by GEF to
       support four new PAs would be processed, and the remaining funding for 8
       additional PAs would be included incrementally thereafter. The Project Appraisal
       Document (PAD) presented the financing costs and plan for the initial tranche
       covering four PAs and those for the total project costs upon release of all
       subsequent tranches for the eight additional PAs. It also detailed the process to be
       followed to secure approval of supplemental financing in subsequent tranches3.

  In essence it was agreed to follow what for Bank lending would be an Adaptable Program Loan, with
streamlined procedures for Bank Board approval of any capitalizations beyond the first tranche, within the
overall framework of the Project approved for the first operation, and subject to compliance with agreed
triggers.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

      6. The Project’s global objective was to promote the conservation and sustainable
         use of biodiversity in Mexico through the consolidation of the National System of
         Protected Areas (SINAP). Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were to: (a)
         Conserve globally important biodiversity in selected areas of SINAP; (b) Promote
         the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of productive activities in
         selected PAs; (c) Promote social co-responsibility for conservation; and (d)
         Promote the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use criteria in
         development projects and other practices affecting selected PAs.

      7. The Key Indicators to measure progress towards the Project’s global objective
         and PDOs were as follows4:

Global Objective: Consolidate the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in
Mexico’s natural protected areas

       Trends in the rate of habitat conversion in protected areas included in the Project
       Trends in the frequency of observations of indicator species selected for each area

PDO 1: Conserve globally important biodiversity in selected areas of the National
System of Protected Natural Areas (SINAP)

       No significant decrease in selected indicator species
       Zero habitat conversion in core area (or equivalent)
       Gradual decrease in rate of habitat conversion in each area

PDO 2: Promote the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of productive
activities in selected PAs

       Proportion of area under sustainable management from the total area of non-
        sustainable use increased at least doubled
       Proportion of land users applying sustainable practices from the total land users in
        the PA is at least doubled

PDO 3: Promote social co-responsibility for conservation

       At least 80% of conservation initiatives are the result of the participatory process
        promoted by the Project (including design and execution of the initiatives)

    The PDOs and Indicators were transcribed exactly as they appear in the PAD.



                                                     13
PDO 4: Promote the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use criteria
in development projects and other practices affecting the selected protected areas

    At least 20% of the funds invested at the PA level by non-environmental agencies
     is compatible with conservation and/or sustainable use of biodiversity
    At least 80% of the development initiatives financed by non-environmental
     agencies have no negative impacts on biodiversity, or include mitigation measures


1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

   8. The GEO and Key Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

   9. The main project beneficiaries were expected to be the population living in the
      PAs included under SINAP II and surrounding zones. Most of these were small
      agricultural producers in their own or community land, or persons engaged in
      cattle rearing, fishing or forestry. The use of natural resources was considered
      important for direct consumption, medical purposes, or handicrafts production.
      Productivity was seen as low and commercialization inefficient and not
      sustainable. Most communities were considered marginalized and lived in
      extreme poverty. The Project aimed to benefit this population by promoting
      sustainable alternatives for better use of their resources combining conservation
      with poverty reduction efforts, ensuring that this population shared the benefits of
      PA conservation.

   10. Several of the PAs supported by SINAP II were to benefit indigenous groups that
       in some cases comprised an important proportion of the population in the PAs and
       buffer zones. In some of the PAs, indigenous groups represented over 50 percent
       of the target population. These indigenous groups were seen as having an
       important role to play in conservation since they maintained a close dependence
       on natural resources and owned many of the lands in the PAs. A summary of the
       population, including indigenous groups, which were to benefit from the Project,
       is presented in Annex 12.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

   11. The Project, through its four phases, comprised four components described below.

Component 1:         Expansion of the Fund for Natural Protected Areas




                                           14
                           (Total US$21.2 million, GEF US$10.6 million)5

    12. This component was designed to support the capitalization of the FANP. GEF
        funds deposited in the endowment fund were to be matched on a 1:1 basis, in
        accordance with rules that were described in the PAD. Detailed procedures to
        manage the endowment fund were spelled out in the PAD and in an Operational
        Manual. For the first phase US$9.4 million was to be deposited in the endowment
        fund. The investment income of the fund would support basic conservation
        operating costs of four new priority PAs not covered in SINAP I: (a) Tehuacán-
        Cuicatlán; (b) Alto Golfo y Delta del Rio Colorado; (c) Cuatrociénegas, and (d)
        Corredor Chichinautzin-Zempoala (Annex 9). It also was to finance incremental
        FANP administrative expenses. Through additional GEF support in future phases,
        the FANP endowment fund was to be further expanded to generate investment
        income for eight additional new PAs. An up-front four-step process for selection
        of the four initial PAs and the eight subsequent ones was interactive, including
        academic groups, NGOs and official agencies in addition to CONANP, and
        applied eight selection criteria: (a) type, dimension and immediacy of threats; (b)
        number and type of ecosystems; (c) species richness; (d) endemism; (e)
        socioeconomic availability for a conservation project; (f) services and
        environmental functions; (g) at risk species concentration; and (h) eco-region
        representativity. A reserve of US$1.9 million was set aside for the start-up costs
        of the 12 reserves in their first year of operation, while the endowment fund
        accrued interest.

    13. This component also aimed to support the optimal operation of the endowment
        fund, and included support for a fund-raising program involving the GOM, the
        FMCN, and alliances with other national and international NGOs. The targeted
        groups of fund-raising activities were to include major government/private firms,
        as well as foundations. The fund-raising program was to be carried out jointly by
        FMCN and CONANP; GEF would contribute US$1.2 million, and FMCN and
        CONANP together a matching amount.

    14. The PAD described the process that was to be followed to further capitalize the
        FANP endowment to cover eight additional PAs, including: (a) streamlined
        procedures for processing additional tranches of financing required to meet the
        goal of capitalizing the remaining eight PAs; (b) cost estimates and underlying
        assumptions and criteria; (c) financial projections for the investment income from
        the expanded FANP; (d) the fund-raising strategy proposed to further expand the
        endowment funds, and (e) investment guidelines to be adopted for FANP
        management. Streamlined procedures for the funding requests to further expand
        the endowment would be considered on the basis of a template that contained the


5
  The total project costs and GEF contribution for each component in this Section refer to the first phase of
the Project, as approved in 2002. A breakdown of allocations, total and by GEF, for all phases is described
in Section 1.7 and in Annex 1



                                                     15
     following: (a) reserve-specific logical framework with PA-specific indicators that
     followed the general structure of the log-frame set out for the entire Project in the
     PAD; (b) evidence of matching contributions to the endowment—every dollar of
     non-GEF funding would trigger a dollar of GEF funding, and since US$1.875
     million were considered necessary as match to endow one PA, future GEF
     disbursements would consider increments of PA endowment units; (c) adequate
     social assessments for the entering PA(s), as well as appropriate design of
     remedial actions, as needed; (d) adequate evaluation of indigenous peoples’ issues
     and appropriate design of Indigenous Peoples’ Development Plans (IPDPs), as
     needed, and (e) endowment contributions by SEMARNAT to FANP, in order to
     cover taxes during project implementation. Compliance of the requested
     additional funding with the Bank’s applicable safeguard and fiduciary policies
     would be ensured by applying the procedures described in the PAD (particularly
     in the annexes on procurement, disbursement, and environmental analysis), and
     through implementation of the IPDPs included in the request for additional GEF
     support.

Component 2:         Protected Area Conservation Programs
                     (Total US$13.87 million, income from GEF)

  15. This component was designed to finance the implementation of management
      activities at PA level. Eligible basic conservation activities in the Project’s four
      initial PAs would be supported through a mix of FANP-generated income, fiscal
      funds and other sources of financing. Detailed information on these four initial
      PAs, as well as the additional eight that were to be included in subsequent phases
      was provided in the PAD. Activities that were to be financed at the reserve level
      by income from the endowment included equipment, materials, supplies,
      consultants and basic operation costs, and conservation, community and capacity-
      building activities. The GOM had committed to maintain the basic staff and
      recurrent costs for all 12 PAs throughout SINAP II’s implementation and beyond.

Component 3:         System-wide Institutional Strengthening
                     (Total US$4.10 million, GEF US$0.2 million)

  16. This component included three sub-components, as follows. The Central
      Coordination Sub-Component would support activities involving the endowment-
      supported PAs as a group, including capacity building and technical assistance to
      the PAs, monitoring and evaluation systems, and social participation in the
      protected areas program. The Government Institutional Strengthening Sub-
      Component would support CONANP’s transition to an effective conservation
      agency, and the related adoption and execution of strategies for performance,
      strategic planning, environmental information, marketing, interaction with donor
      and NGO sectors, information technology and systems, human resources, physical
      resources, communications, and adaptive management. The NGOs and CSOs
      Strengthening Sub-Component would help establish and consolidate a Mexican
      Conservation Learning Network (MCLN) for the sharing and adoption of



                                          16
       knowledge on protected areas management, benefitting NGOs and CSOs. All
       NGOS involved in management activities of the GEF-supported PAs would be
       eligible to participate, and would receive direct assistance from program staff,
       access to information and databases, and regular assistance with assessment of
       organizational development in competencies such as planning, management,
       leadership, administration, monitoring and evaluation, and finance.

Component 4:         Mainstreaming Conservation and Sustainable Use Policies
                     (Total US$20.95 million, GEF US$5.3 million

   17. This component was designed to promote the inclusion of criteria of biodiversity
       conservation and sustainable use in the development programs and initiatives
       affecting the selected PAs. Specifically, it aimed to: (a) establish and strengthen
       legal, normative and operational tools to mainstream biodiversity conservation
       criteria in sectoral policies and programs (e.g., inter-institutional agreements,
       technical manuals for civil servants); (b) establish and promote planning tools and
       mechanisms to promote sustainable development in PAs (e.g., communication
       and education campaigns, community-level sustainable development plans and
       micro-regional councils, capacity-building for sustainable development
       initiatives), and (c) mobilize funding from sources other than CONANP for
       investments in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in PAs
       (through, for example, fiscal incentives, establishment of a group of “business
       leaders for conservation?). It would finance studies and consultancies, salaries of
       coordinators in the filed, workshops and capacity building courses, publications,
       audio-visuals, television/radio broadcasts and other communication material, and
       incremental operating expenses at both the central and PA levels.

1.6 Revised Components

   18. The Project’s components were not revised (other than the additional financing
       that was provided as described in Section 1.7 below). There was, however, a
       reorientation of priorities for GEF funding in 2008. In that year, CONANP
       secured GOM funding for an additional 911 staff, of which 152 represented staff
       that were assigned to SINAP I and II PAs (Section 3.5 b). This resulted in freeing
       thwo thirds of the FANP fund allocated to PAs. Following discussions between
       CONANP, FMCN, CTFANP and the Bank, it was agreed that the funds
       previously financing staff costs at the PA level could be used to finance Strategic
       Innovation Projects (PIEs) aimed at strengthening the long-term management of
       the PAs by supporting innovative strategies managed by NGOs and local
       community groups, through a selective process that would ensure alignment with
       PA priorities.

        Financing for the first phase, as described in the PAD, was approved on February
        7, 2002. In accordance with the procedures described in the PAD, three
        additional phases were later approved as supplemental grants to further capitalize
        the endowment of the protected areas fund FANP, as detailed in Table 1 below:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

    20. Project preparation benefited from the previously successful experience under
        SINAP I, incorporating lessons of experience during its implementation that had
        been identified under an Independent Evaluation of that project carried out in
        2000, its Mid-Term Review in November 2000, the Implementation Completion
        Report of the Mexico Environmental Project, dated February 8, 1999, and the
        GEF Secretariat’s Evaluation Report No. 1-99, Experience with Conservation
        Trust Funds. These included several lessons aimed at improving design through
        institutional and financing adjustments aimed at consolidating and improving the
        SINAP’s social strategies in PAs and consensus towards conservation and
        sustainable use of natural resources. Lessons also pointed to the importance of
        defining clear, tangible and quantifiable objectives and indicators, and monitoring
        according to program-wide indicators in order to track progress. Another lesson
        previously identified relating to funding for natural disaster was addressed
        through the establishment of an Emergency Fund that totaled up to 10 percent of
        the full disbursement to the FANP PAs that could be accessed by any
        participating PA if needed.

    21. The Project’s institutional arrangements, with minor procedural adjustments, were
        to follow those of SINAP I that had proven to be successful. Building on the
        successful public-private partnership that existed, those arrangements included


                                                    18
      participatory processes involving government, NGOs, CSOs, the private sector
      and stakeholders. FMCN had established transparent and reliable procedures that
      provided a sense of confidence to potential donors that was essential to continued
      resource mobilization efforts. The FANP would continue to be managed
      conservatively by the FMCN’s Board Investment Committee composed of
      bankers and financial experts. Management of FANP’s operational aspects would
      continue to count on the programmatic and technical recommendations made by
      the Technical Committee for the Natural Protected Areas Fund (CTFANP), the
      advisory board made up of seven members of key government, private sector and
      CSOs, ensuring representation of key groups in management of the FANP.
      Selection of the PAs to be included under the SINAP II followed a participatory
      process involving representatives of NGOs, government, academia and social
      organizations.

   22. There were several features of the Project’s design that contributed directly to its
       timely implementation and success. The design of the GEF lending instrument
       was responsive to constraints faced with respect to GEF funding at the start. The
       model that was adopted of processing a first phase to support 4 PAs then followed
       by additional phases and PAs as and when constraints were eased and conditions
       on the incorporation of additional PAs were met (including funds mobilization)
       proved to be highly effective. GEF financing under subsequent phases was to be
       allocated to the endowment fund only, while all financing for institutional
       strengthening activities under Components 3 and 4 was provided in the first phase.
       As a result, all 12 SINAP II PAs were able to benefit from these activities from
       the start of the Project.

   23. The design of the FANP endowment also had several very positive features. First,
       the high standards (1:1) to leverage GEF funding provided strong incentives for
       private and public fundraising. Also, the design of the fundraising strategy
       offered greater flexibility towards mobilizing additional funding for FANP.
       While GEF endowment funds (under all phases) would be directed to cover basic
       conservation in 12 PAs, matching funds from private foundations could be used to
       cover basic conservation or other complementary activities in a group of 34 PAs,
       including those under SINAP I and SINAP II and 12 others identified according
       to the same process and criteria as those under SINAP II. Finally, in addition to
       the US$22.5 million that GEF was to contribute to the FANP endowment over the
       Project’s four phases, SINAP II’s design provided for an additional US$1.9
       million in 2002, to get a running start in the first four PAs even before the FANP
       endowment began producing interest and payouts. This avoided initial delays that
       could have otherwise affected project implementation in these PAs.

2.2 Implementation

   24. The Project was signed on February 13, 2002 with a SDR 12.8 million Grant.
       Subsequent phases that capitalized the FANP endowment for additional PAs were
       approved as detailed in Section 1.7. SINAP II was completed on June 30, 2010,



                                           19
   after a successful implementation. The Project was rated Satisfactory for
   Implementation Progress and Development Objectives throughout its
   implementation. Several factors influenced this solid progress, as described
   below.

25. The Government maintained and even reinforced its commitment to the Project
    throughout implementation. Its commitment of US$8.5 million to FANP is a
    reflection of its commitment to SINAP, and to the existing framework in place to
    pursue its conservation objectives through a successful public-private partnership.
    The GOM’s additional funding of 911 full-time civil service positions in
    CONANP from 2008 onwards (of which 152 were supported by FANP), not only
    increased the level of funding available at the level of individual PAs but served
    as a strong indication of the priority it attaches to the SINANP. Government
    funding for basic operations have increased over time, covering the vast majority
    of the PA’s needs (80 percent).

26. The Project’s strong institutional framework, and the seamless relationship
    between its two principle implementing agencies, CONANP and FMCN, coupled
    with their strong capacity, set a standard for successful implementation.
    Commitment to the Project by both of these agencies, together with the advisory
    structure built into the Project’s design, particularly the authority held by the
    Technical Committee for the FANP (CTFANP) that reviews how funds are
    managed and disbursed ensured regular opportunities to align the FANP with
    GOM priorities and to ensure high level reviews of SINAP. The fluid relationship
    among Government officials and the FMCN members, also helped sustain an
    effective public-private partnership and align priorities. At the PA level, processes
    that engage PA Directors and Regional Directors, in consultation with local
    advisory councils and communities, have helped to ensure ongoing alignment
    with CONANP priorities.

27. Project implementation and supervision was pragmatic and forward-looking,
    adjusting and adapting in response to an ambitious agenda and emerging realities.
    When CONANP’s institutional capacity was boosted through additional funding
    and new staff positions, project funding that had been allocated to PA staffing
    through the POAs became available for other applications. Using the same
    participatory processes that have come to characterize CONANP and FANP’s
    working strategy, agreement was reached to shift the application of FANP
    funding from basic PA needs to strengthening the long-term management of the
    PAs by supporting innovative strategies through Strategic Innovation Grants
    (PIEs) managed by NGOs and local community groups. Alignment with PA
    priorities is ensured since PA Directors have a strong voice in ensuring that PA
    priorities are incorporated within all disbursements from the FANP to NGOs.
    This was seen as an opportunity to advance needed investments in areas such as
    monitoring and evaluation, sustainable development initiatives and reforestation
    while at the same time engage nonprofits in PAs over the longer term and provide
    an incentive for additional fundraising. Whereas FANP funding was required for



                                         20
      basic PA operation at the start (financing 100 percent of the PAs’ budgets), the
      GOM’s increased support, coupled with the successful redirection of FANP
      funding (now only 20 percent is allocated to PAs for core operations and
      expenditures) has allowed FANP funding to support strategic priorities and
      leverage additional funding from CSOs in support of them. The small amount of
      funding provided to PAs through FANP is still important, especially in view of
      the flexibility with which these funds can be accessed and disbursed. They have,
      for example, allowed PAs to use these FANP funds temporarily to avoid funding
      constraints due to the Government’s more bureaucratic approval procedures in the
      first quarter.

   28. Good quality at entry, coupled with a strong capacity of the implementing
       agencies to manage and address routine fiduciary and safeguard issues, allowed
       implementation and supervision to focus on the specific project activities and
       processes that were designed to achieve its objectives. Stability in senior
       positions within CONANP and in the leadership of FMCN, as well as in the
       Bank’s Task Manager that was responsible for supervision from approval through
       completion, assured a high level of continuity in implementation and supervision.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

   29. The Project’s M&E system updated and extended the M&E framework under
       SINAP I. The M&E framework contains general impact indicators and specific
       indicators that were to be monitored for each of the PAs under the Project. It also
       includes output indicators, by Project Component (Annex 2).

   30. Both CONANP and FMCN have developed a strong culture of monitoring and
       evaluation at the broadest level, and have strengthened their institutional capacity
       and partnerships with other government agencies and experts to compile and
       analyze information over time, and use it to inform the allocation of staff and
       resources to contain emerging threats to conservation and to monitor the activities
       supported by the Project and their impacts.

   31. CONANP’s Office for Monitoring and Evaluation, established in 2001, counts
       with 28 full-time staff and reports directly to CONANP’s Director. The Project’s
       Component 3, System Wide Institutional Strengthening, provided support to
       strengthen CONANP’s M&E systems. Under the Project, FANP funds have
       assisted PA Directors in engaging PA staff and local communities in building
       five-year plans for respective PA Management Programs and corresponding
       logical frameworks based on standard indicators (which are also the Project’s
       indicators). Within the overall structure of these five-year Management Programs,
       yearly POAs prepared by all PAs include monitoring line items, many of which
       are financed by FANP funds. A strong commitment to the use of results
       frameworks, by PAs, tied to their POAs has led to a culture of using monitoring
       strategically to guide progress towards accomplishment of objectives in the PAs’
       Management Programs. CONANP’s M&E Office has built a comprehensive



                                           21
      system, the Sistema de Información, Monitoreo, y Evaluación para la
      Conservación-SIMEC (System of Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation of
      Conservation) record and track progress on standard indicators, by PA, and to
      ensure that solid scientific data can help drive strategies and projects and support
      the POAs.

   32. CONANP has enhanced its use of Global Information System (GIS) Technology,
       by which habitat conversion can be identified through satellite imagery of PAs,
       over time. A GIS lab is part of this infrastructural investment. Biological,
       geographical and socio-economic data is collected. This, together with the digital
       images and field observations is being used to monitor habitat conversion rates for
       each of SINAP’s PAs. CONANP has also taken an important step in establishing
       a system under SIMEC for monitoring indicator species by PA. As a first effort,
       SIMEC now includes detailed data on indicator species in each of the Project’s 12
       PAs that includes information on species taxonomy, biology, distribution, habitat
       and behavior, together with methodology for tracking, and assumptions of current
       populations. These are PA-specific and compiled by CONANP personnel
       working in each of the PAs, and resulted in the selection of 56 species that are
       being monitored by the 12 PAs.

   33. FMCN has also worked closely with CONANP to pull together data sources for
       addressing the effectiveness of PAs, engaging staff, training, and new networks
       and for providing yearly reports to the Bank.

   34. An Independent evaluation of the Project was carried out in 2010, reviewing
       experience from its earliest phase through completion, and offering several
       recommendations for the future based on that experience.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

   35. Safeguards. As this was a GEF Project that was expected to be environmentally
       beneficial by its design, the entire project could be interpreted as an
       environmental management program. Although it was not expected to have any
       significant negative impacts on the environment, productive activities and rural
       development in the buffer zones, in-park infrastructure, and sustainable
       development initiative promoted through the mainstreaming component could
       result in low-level impacts. To ensure that any potential impact of these activities
       was fully mitigated, PA personnel were to be responsible for implementation of
       the Management Program of the specific PA and the application of the PA Law
       and its zoning rules. Appropriate impact assessments were to be prepared and
       reviewed as required by Government legislation, and approved by CONANP and
       SEMARNAT.

   36. While few of the activities in PAs involved significant infrastructure development,
       those that did played a key role in reviewing environmental impact analyses, and
       proposals for land use changes. Often, the establishment and management of a



                                           22
      PA in itself accelerated the demand for infrastructure development. CONANP
      developed an on-line tracking tool for all investments that could result in a change
      of land use within the PA system. This instrument: (a) provides direction on the
      process for carrying out environmental impact studies; (b) lists all investments for
      which environmental impact assessments have not been prepared, and (c) tracks
      the number of days between posting of the proposed investment and completion
      of the impact assessment. Several PAs have acquired capacity to evaluate the
      environmental impact studies that are required for significant infrastructure
      projects. The process for evaluating environmental impact assessments provides
      an important opportunity to involve stakeholders in the proposed mitigation
      measures.

   37. As part of preparation, an indigenous people’s strategy was prepared to ensure
       that indigenous communities would participate and benefit from the project. In
       specific PAs where indigenous populations reside, Indigenous Peoples
       Development Plans were prepared. Subsequent phases of financing required the
       preparation of IPDPs (later IPPs) as a condition of approval.

   38. In PAs that included indigenous populations, the development of Programs for the
       Development of Indigenous Communities (PDPI) were developed under the
       Project. The objective of the PDPIs is to (a) strengthen indigenous institutions;
       (b) provide support for participation in management of the PA; (c) encourage
       sustainable development initiatives compatible with native culture, and (d)
       support indigenous values and traditions. The POAs of the PAs with indigenous
       populations include details regarding the actions and implementation of the PDPIs,
       as well as amounts budgeted to carry them out. PA Directors signed Memoranda
       of Understanding with specific indigenous groups that detailed activities, funding
       and indicators and procedures for monitoring.

   39. Almost 44 percent of the Sustainable Development Initiatives (IDS) financed with
       Project funds in the 12 PAs were implemented by indigenous groups. CONANP
       has established close working relations with the Indigenous Development
       Commission (CDI) that has provided complementary funds in support of the IDS.

   40. Clear procurement and financial management procedures were developed for
       ensuring that funds supporting the PAs were used efficiently and well
       documented. Funds were disbursed quarterly on the basis of standard reports and
       receipts documenting the use of previous disbursement before releasing
       subsequent amounts to the PAs. PA Directors were required to sign off on the
       expenditure reports to ensure that funds used were aligned with PA priorities.
       Disbursements were not relased unless prior reports had been shared with PA
       stakeholders.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

   41. A follow-up project is not being considered. The Independent evaluation of
       SINAP II concludes “this Project is ready to move beyond World Bank


                                          23
      supervision and is being well managed by the two principal partners, FMCN and
      CONANP.? FANP has prepared a Plan for the Future Implementation of SINAP
      II, as required by the Grant Agreement. This Plan provides for the supervisory
      role that had been provided by the Bank to be taken over by CTFANP, reporting
      to the CNANP and the Board of FMCN. Other than this change, activities are
      expected to continue as at present, within the framework of the 2010 FANP
      Operational Manual that defines procedures and responsibilities with respect to
      the 23 PAs under SINAP I and SINAP II.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

   42. The Project and its objectives and design continue to maintain extremely high
       relevance to the Government’s, the Bank’s and GEF’s assistance strategies. The
       Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Mexico, 2008 – 2013 mentions the
       Government’s priorities from its National Development Plan that include
       environmental sustainability, especially to turn the concept of environmental
       sustainability into a cross-cutting element of public policies and assure that all
       public and private investments are compatible with environmental protection. As
       for Bank Strategy, the CAS includes specific goals for the number of hectares of
       areas under sustainable forest management increase, reforestation, degradation of
       the natural resource base and increase in Natural Protected Areas. It also
       mentions leveraging grant resources concentrated in the environment sector,
       further reducing the overall cost of borrowing. The Project continues to be fully
       consistent with GEF’s Biodiversity focal area and operational policies, as
       described in the PAD.

   43. The same rationale for strong support to the Project’s objectives and its design
       when it was prepared continues to be highly relevant: Mexico harbors more than
       10 percent of the planet’s biodiversity, and, despite impressive efforts under
       SINAP I and SINAP II, continued strong efforts aimed at conservation and
       sustainable use management are needed to contain further losses.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

   44. The Project’s achievement of its objectives have been met and, in many cases,
       exceeded. Like the earlier SINAP I, the Project was extraordinarily successful in
       meeting its global environmental and specific objectives, both of which have an
       impact that goes well beyond the specific outcomes achieved for the 12 PAs
       included under the Project, to impact the whole of the institutional, financial and
       social structure that supports the Government’s SINAP. The Independent
       evaluation of SINAP II concludes that the Project is being well managed by the




                                           24
          two principal partners, CONCNP and FMCN, and that it is “the best public-
          private partnership we have seen put into practice?.6


Global Objective: Consolidate the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in
Mexico’s natural protected areas

      45. Mexico has made an impressive commitment to its National System of Protected
          Areas. SINAP now encompasses 173 federal PAs covering 24.4 million hectares
          equivalent to over 10 percent of the national territory. It has demonstrated its
          commitment to its efforts by putting in place and constantly improving an
          effective and efficient institutional structure to manage its PAs and monitor
          progress, supported not only through strong budgetary commitments, but also
          through a successful model of public-private partnerships to mobilize and manage
          important resources to make the effort sustainable.

      46. Under the SINAP I, FANP was capitalized to provide support for basic
          conservation efforts in ten priority PAs. The Project provided further, phased,
          capitalization of FANP to support similar efforts in 12 additional PAs that were
          selected on the basis of a consultative process and according to criteria described
          in Section 1.3. The 12 PAs selected for inclusion under the Project are presented
          in Annex 10.7 The selected sites were of exceptionally high regional and global
          significance, and representative of Mexico’s vast biodiversity and the
          conservations threats and issues the country faces. These PAs included highly
          threatened areas; the Project took on some of the more difficult and intractable
          issues affecting the long-term health of ecosystem services and biodiversity
          values in Mexico. Progress towards the accomplishment of the Project’s Global
          Objective has been impressive, especially given that these PAs were incorporated
          under the Project in a phased manner and these are initial outcomes after only a
          few years in the case of some PAs. Progress towards accomplishment of the
          Project’s Global Objective according to the indicators below is described under
          the Project’s first objective.

       Trends in the rate of habitat conversion in protected areas included in the Project
       Trends in the frequency of observations of indicator species selected for each area

 Two of the twelve PAs originally selected for inclusion in the Project, Pantanos de Centla and Sierra de
Huautla, were substituted for El Ocote and Mapimí.

47. This objective was achieved through consistent Government commitment to the
    SINAP, a remarkable effort by the FMCN in consolidating its reputation both
    nationally and internationally as the largest private environmental trust fund in the
    developing world, and through a sustained effort on the part of CONANP, aided
    by increasingly stronger Government financial commitment, to work in unison
    with NGOs, CSOs, the private sector, community organizations and academic
    institutions, to put in place increasingly effective PA management strategies
    supported by a strong focus on monitoring and evaluation. Together, these factors
    had a very positive, synergistic effect towards the accomplishment of the Project’s
    first objective.

48. FMCN/FANP.        FMCN performed exceptionally well in capitalizing and
    managing the FANP. GEF deposits to FANP totaled US$22,564.77 under the
    Project (including its four phases). Matching funds exceeded the ambitious 1:1
    ratio that had been established during preparation by more than US$7 million,
    totaling US$29,746,834 at completion. The FANP endowment now totals
    US$75,691,291, including GEF deposits and counterpart allocations, coupled with
    interest. FANP currently generates over US$3.8 million in interest to finance
    conservation activities in 22 PAs.

49. The funds generated through interest on the FANP endowment have been
    channeled through NGOs to support the Annual Operating Plans (POAs) of the
    Project’s 12 PAs. With the increased Government support to CONANP starting
    in 2008, funding has also been channeled directly to NGOs/CSOs for
    implementation of PIEs in collaboration with the respective PA Directors and
    staff. The FANP continues to channel funds through NGOs to support the POAs
    of the 10 PAs included in SINAP I.

50. At the PA level, these funds have supported basic operation costs, basic
    equipment, basic conservation activities, basic community activities, and basic
    capacity-building activities included in each PA’s POA. While Government
    funding covered the costs of the PA Director, Sub-Director and two technical staff,
    FANP funding was often used to finance complementary staff such as social
    promoters and staff for M&E. PAs were allowed to access funds on the basis of
    their POAs that set out basic operational priorities, activities and budgets. At
    completion, all SINAP II PAs had core staff in place, dependable annual budgets,
    five year plans for Management Programs with associated results frameworks,
    supported by yearly POAs that set out the strategic directions to enhance
    conservation efforts.

51. CONANP invested continuously in developing and strengthening M&E, both at
    the central level and in the PAs through staffing and training, and using
    increasingly the information to feed into adjustments and the development of ever
    more effective PA management strategies.




                                         26
       No significant decrease in selected indicator species

      52. Preliminary analysis conducted on the basis of data for 34 monitored species is
          encouraging. Of those with statistically significant results, eight showed an
          increase in the species, while only two revealed a decrease. Still, it is interesting
          to note that the majority of the statistically significant results, by species, were
          associated with PAs that have been supported by the Project since its first phase,
          starting in 2002, indicating that sustained efforts to develop and adjust monitoring
          procedures over time are needed to produce a noticeable impact on the species
          population. CONANP/FNCM reports that 78 percent of the 34 species that have
          been under observation for at least two years had an increase in the frequency of
          observations.

      53. More important than these results, which are observed very early after most of the
          Project’s PAs were brought under the Project, is the fact that CONANP/FMCN
          have adopted a culture of monitoring to guide priorities and programs at the level
          of individual PAs with respect to indicator species. A Independent evaluation of
          SINAP II notes that “CONANP, and its academic research partners,
          systematically monitor species in many PAs, use a variety of scientifically valid
          methodologies, and are making an effort to connect the survey with feedback for
          protected area managers. The 2008 report from CONANP/FANP on the
          biological indicators provides a sense of the huge variety of methods being
          undertaken and an impressive array of species being tracked. These are all signs
          of a health M&E system being aligned with efforts to increase management
          effectiveness?.8


       Zero habitat conversion in core area (or equivalent)
       Gradual decrease in rate of habitat conversion in each area

      54. CONANP has enhanced its use of Global Information System Technology, by
          which habitat conversion can be identified through satellite imagery of PAs, over
          time. GIS technology, together with the digital images and field observations has
          provided encouraging, albeit preliminary, results on habitat conversion rates for
          the PAs under the Project. An analysis by FMCN and CONANP of trends in the
          rate of habitat conversion in the Project’s PAs, encompassing data from several
          sources, shows that conversion rates have slowed since the PAs were established,
          and that deforestation rates are lower inside the PAs than in their immediate
          surroundings. Further, a study contracted by FMCN and CONANP, Estimación y
          Actualización de la Tasa de Transormación del Hábitat de las ?reas Naturales
          Protegidas SINAP I y SINAP II del FANP, presented the conversion rates for nine

          out of the twelve PAs based on the satellite imagery over time, revealing strong
          progress towards the Project’s Global Development and first objectives9. Results
          indicated that for five PAs habitat conversion had slowed during implementation
          (Corredor Chichinautzin-Zempoala, Cuatrociénegas, Sierra de ?lamos-Rio
          Cuchujaqui, Sierra La Laguna and La Sepultura), two PAs showed a positive
          conversion whereby the forested area actually increased (La Encrucijada and El
          Ocote), one PA showed positive conversion followed by minimal deforestation
          (Mapimí) and only one PA reported an increase in deforestation (Tehuacán-
          Cuicatlán).

     55. Fire damage is one of the biggest indicators of changes in land use, since farmer
         often resort to setting fires to expand agricultural areas. A large number of PAs
         have established fire education programs, training, and effective management
         programs aimed at containing the use of what is a threat to conservation efforts.
         CONANP has also engaged in efforts aimed at reforestation and revegetation of
         areas previously affected by fires, agricultural use and extensive grazing, often in
         coordination with the Mexican National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR).
         CONANP’s 2007-2012 Strategic Plan of 2007-2012 assigns high priority to
         restoration efforts, particularly along biological corridors.

     56. More importantly, however, CONANP and FMCN have developed a strong
         culture of monitoring and evaluation at the broadest level, and have strengthened
         their institutional capacity and partnerships with other government agencies and
         experts to compile and analyze information over time, and use it to inform the
         allocation of staff and resources to contain emerging threats to habitat conversion.
         Supported by follow-up at the PA level, CONANP now has land use maps for
         each PA, over time, showing the specific habitats affected by conversion, the
         causes of conversion, and the actions being taken to address it.


PDO 2: Promote the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of productive
activities in selected PAs


      Proportion of area under sustainable management from the total area of non-
       sustainable use increased (at least doubled)
      Proportion of land users applying sustainable practices from the total land users in
       the PA is at least doubled

     57. The income generated through the gradual expansion of the FANP endowment
         described above, together with GOM, NGO and other contributions was used to
         finance Sustainable Development Initiatives (IDS) managed by CONANP’s

         Project Coordination Unit through Project Coordinators located in each of SINAP
         II’s 12 PAs. Funding from GEF for IDS was complemented by CONANP with
         additional funding from its PROCODES (Conservation for Sustainable
         Development), PET (Temporary Employment Program) and native corn (maíz
         criollo) programs, and by other federal, state and muncipal agencies. These IDS
         were activities aimed to support the implementation of the PA management
         programs, including financing of basic personnel, operational costs, equipment,
         and conservation activities. The Project’s contribution to IDS increased during
         the last two years of implementation through FANP funding for the PIEs. IDS
         activities helped establish positive relations with implementing CSOs and local
         communities, and the long-term prospects of many of the activities supported are
         considered very positive.

    58. In 2002, 4,670 ha in SINAP II’s four initial PAs were under sustainable
        management. This figure has increased to 11,022 ha in 12 PAs supported by the
        Project in 2010, representing a more than doubling of the area under sustainable
        management. CONANP/FMCN compiled information on these indicators using
        information from satellite imagery to establish the non-forest area as a proxy for
        the total area of non-sustainable use. The targets for these outcome indicators
        were met or surpassed in all of SINAP II PAs, except one (Corredor Biologico
        Chichinautzin – PN el Tepozteco y Lagunas de Zempoala). Table 2 presents the
        proportion of area under sustainable management and the proportion of land users
        applying sustainable practices for the Project’s 12 PAs.

PDO 3: Promote social co-responsibility for conservation


      At least 80% conservation initiatives are the result of the participatory process
       promoted by the Project (including design and execution of the initiatives)

     59. Progress towards this PDO has been met, and exceeded. The IDSs are designed
         and implemented through participatory processes, in that the CONANP
         coordination in the PA chose residents of the community or related to the PA to
         coordinate the conservation strategy. Through a participatory planning process,
         the members of the IDS identified environmental, social and economic benefits
         that in addition allowed them to identify alternative sources of financing.
         Communities with the assistance of the respective PA Director and staff were
         responsible for both the design and implementation of activities under the IDSs,
         thereby ensuring social participation in the conservation initiatives. The PAs’
         five-year Management Programs and corresponding results frameworks, POAs,
         Annual Reports and productive activities are reviewed by their respective
         Advisory Councils and/or Sub-Councils at the PA level and by FANP at the
         national level. Each of these bodies comprises stakeholder groups that are
         actively involved in all stages of the process, both at the PA and national levels.

     60. SINAP II’s Independent Evaluation notes “The IDS and PIE projects have
         provided a whole suite of opportunities to work with local communities and the
         civil sector, and to formalize co-responsibility for conservation through project
         agreements. Both the IDS and PIE projects have enabled PA staff to interact on a
         regular basis with local communities, building confidence and trust, while
         delivering the conservation message. The evaluators were struck by the capacity
         of local communities to understand and discuss conservation themes, and to
         advocate conservation measures. Training and organizational development
         activities are a regular component of the IDS project and can be part of PIE
         projects, as well, and these activities have provided tools to communities that
         allow them to generate the financial resources that allow them to put into practice
         the conservation concepts that they learn.?10

     61. The selection criteria for PIEs gives priority to those coordinated by local CSOs,
         and as a consequence these PIEs have worked to strengthen and consolidate the
         interactions between the PA Directors and their staff, and CSOs, allowing them to
         create true partnerships, multiplying the number of conservation efforts in PAs
         and also supporting the development of stronger institutional capacity. The
         SINAP II Final Assessment concludes, “It is impressive to note the number of

       international, federal, state and municipal agencies that interact within a given PA.
       PA Directors have found that harmonization of environmental policies is one of
       the most effective means for harnessing the resources of other agencies and
       developing shared agendas. Still, it was pointed out by several individuals at
       different levels within CONANP that they have only begun to make use of sister
       agencies to further the PA agenda.?


PDO 4: Promote the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use criteria
in development projects and other practices affecting the selected protected areas


    At least 20% of the funds invested at the PA level by non-environmental agencies
     is compatible with conservation and/or sustainable use of biodiversity
    At least 80% of the development initiatives financed by non-environmental
     agencies have no negative impacts on biodiversity, or include mitigation measures

   62. This was the least successful of the Project’s PDOs in part because the expected
       results only applied to a relatively small number of investments by non-
       environmental agencies in only a few of the SINAP II PAs. Still, the indicator’s
       targets were considered met. This PDO was related to PDO 3 in that the activities
       required for both of these objectives presupposed coordination with other
       government agencies. The Project’s requirement for an environmental impact
       assessment, along with the design of mitigation measures, also ensured that any
       infrastructure or other activities under IDS would not have negative impacts on
       biodiversity. Of SINAP II’s 12 PAs, seven assigned priority within their POAs to
       coordinating environmental policies and agreements with other government
       agencies. Several of these have successfully mobilized non-environmental
       agency support for their conservation projects, especially from CONAFOR and
       CDI.

3.3 Efficiency

   63. A formal ex-post economic analysis has not been prepared. Efficiency is rated on
       the basis of two key indicators: management of the FANP and administrative
       costs. There have not been additional analyses other than the incremental cost
       analysis required for GEF projects presented on Annex 4 in the PAD.

   64. The FMCN contracts an independent investment manager to manage its portfolio,
       including the FANP. At the direction of FMCN, the FANP is managed
       conservatively, following a Board Policy that mandates a conservative, risk-
       averse investment strategy with 80 percent of the fund in fixed income
       investments and only 20 percent allocated to equity investments for growth
       purposes. This strategy supports well the FANP’s objectives of providing a stable
       source of funding for expenditures supporting PAs and ensuring support for
       FMCN operations with respect to PAs, while ensuring that the real value of the


                                            31
          FANP endowment is maintained above the cost of inflation. This conservative
          strategy has provided an average pay out of about 6 percent per year from the
          FANP. Returns had averaged about 8.3 percent per year until the international
          financial and economic crisis in 2008, when annual returns turned negative for the
          year. A strong improvement in 2009 (annual returns jumped to 21.7 percent for
          the year), raised the average annual return to the FANP endowment to the level of
          7.44 percent since its establishment. A conservative approach has worked well for
          both the FANP and the PAs it supports during this period of extreme financial
          volatility.

      65. During implementation of SINAP II, FMCN changed the FANP’s independent
          investment manager. This resulted in a lowering of the FANP’s management fees
          from a previous 1 percent to the current 0.02 percent, which is significantly lower
          than the average fees paid for managing most conservation trust funds11.

      66. Administrative costs for both FMCN and NGOs/CSOs have also been
          conservative. The Central Coordination (CC) unit that operates as liaison
          between FMCN and the relevant sector of CONANP (as well as the individual
          PAs) in supporting M&E, developing reporting protocols and providing technical
          assistance to the PAs received 9 percent of the interest from the SINAP II
          endowment to the FANP for studies, workshops and consultancies that covered
          more than one protected area, supporting the strengthening of CONANP. FMCN
          also managed up to 12 percent of the income derived from the earlier SINAP I
          endowment that was assigned to the CC for technical oversight (reporting, field
          visits, and general supervision of project funding) of both SINAP I and SINAP II
          investments. These fees are well within the rates agreed with the Bank under the
          Projct, and also within the range of administrative rates of most trust funds (10-20
          percent of total annual budgets). These fees covered the costs of the project
          director of the FANP, whose roles include fundraising, coordinating the CTFANP,
          managing all reports to the parties, supervising the CC, and technically ensuring
          the effectiveness of the FANP expenditures. The costs of these expenditures
          under SINAP II annual disbursements averaged about 4 percent from 2002 until
          2008, but increased to about 7 percent when the PIEs were introduced and an
          additional staff position was established to support the process.

      67. NGOs/CSOs were also provided with administrative fees to cover the cost of
          hiring additional staff to work with the PA Directors. From 2002-2008, they
          received an average 8.2 percent for this. Starting in 2009, when CONANP
          received increased allocations for staffing, these costs have been reduced
          dramatically to about 2.2 percent for the year, resulting in an average cost of
          around 6 percent during the implementation period.

                                                    32
Rating: Satisfactory

     68. The Project’s Overall Outcome Rating is Satisfactory, based on its continued very
         high relevance, coupled with the sustained and successful progress towards its
         expected development outcomes, and the efficiency with which it was
         implemented and with which the FMCN was managed, including a successful
         effort at mobilizing alternative funding and efforts not only the FANP but also for
         the activities it supports at the local, community level, in support of sustainable
         conservation in Mexico.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

     69. CONANP commissioned a study analyzing the socioeconomic indicators for the
         PAs included under SINAP II that provides important insights into the impact on
         different groups, including indigenous and women, according to the type of
         activity supported by IDS projects.12 In all, 2.937 persons benefited from IDS in
         the 12 PAs during six years of implementation. Projects focusing on forestry
         management, sustainable agriculture, dissemination and education on
         conservation, ecoturism and water alone benefited more than 2,487 persons (85
         percent). Slightly over 37 percent of the beneficiaries of IDS were indigenous,
         mostly concentrated in three PAs. In all, 36 percent of beneficiaries were women.
         The activities that benefited women in greater proportion were handicrafts, water
         collection and conservation and sustainable agriculture. Of these, women were
         beneficiaries of 96 percent of all IDS focused on handicrafts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

     70. The Project’s institutional structure, as well as the consolidation and further
         development of strong institutional capacity among its implementing agencies
         throughout implementation, are major factors underlying its success. As a public-
         private partnership, the SINAP’s institutional framework requires and provides
         for coordination and trust among the different parties, and a solid structure
         through which to engage other agencies as well as advisory groups with strong
         representation from the non-profit community, academic institutions, private
         enterprise, and community organizations. SINAP’s institutional framework
         promotes a strong emphasis on ensuring voice to all involved in assuming
         responsibility and effective management of the country’s PAs.

     71. CONANP’s and FMCN’s institutional capacity were strengthened dramatically
        during the Project’s implementation, in terms of budget, staff, the number of PAs,

           monitoring and evaluation, and the number and variety of sustainable activities it
           supports. CONANP and FMCN are aligned in their priorities and operations, and
           resources are effectively deployed to advance the conservation of biodiversity in
           Mexico in coordination with local communities. The institutional capacity at the
           local level has also consolidated in the Project’s PAs.

       72. CONANP, the GOM’s implementing agency responsible for the management of
           all SINAP I and SINAP II PAs, as well as the wider PA system, managed most of
           the sinking funds13 in the SINAP II Project. GEF funds supported the creation of
           the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) within CONANP and a coordinator was
           assigned to each of the Project’s 12 PAs. The PCU Director reports to the
           Director of Conservation for Development who also manages PROCODES, PET
           and Maíz Criollo, allowing for close coordination among these programs,
           including in the mobilization of funds for the local communities. The PCU has
           established strong and solid coordination with the CC and several other
           Directorates of FONANP, as well. Given its increasing workload and staff,
           CONANP went through a process of regionalization during implementation,
           whereby it was divided into nine regions across the country. Regional directors
           supervise the PA Directors.

       73. The CC within CONANP has provided effective oversight and coordination with
           all of the CONANP PAs and central departments. The CC’s structure, in which it
           is paid for and reports to FMCN but is physically located in CONANP, has been
           effective in maintaining the public-private nature of the FANP. The CC has
           managed funding transparently, working in coordination with PA Directors to
           ensure that priorities are addressed. Its location in CONANP has ensured greater
           levels of coordination, faster communications, and higher level of personal
           relationships and trust in monitoring and recording activities carried out with
           FANP funds in the PAs, developing training programs and special projects to
           address common problems across multiple PAs, reviewing POAs to ensure
           effective allocation of resources in support of priorities, supporting the PAs in
           strategic planning using a log frame approach and synthesizing learning from
           strategic project reviews and partner presentations every year.

       74. The PA Coordinators supported all IDS within their PAs, working with other
           federal, state and municipal agencies to coordinate their inputs into the IDS, thus
           multiplying the funding available to communities. Together with the CONANP
           Director, the PA Coordinators have hired and trained social promoters for each of
           the Project’s 12 PAs. These promoters are motivated and have established
           opportunities for networking, both among themselves as well as with the
           CONANP Director to ensure that sustainable development programs reach local
           communities. In 2002, only 56 PAs had dedicated staff paid by the GOM through
           CONANP. Of the 911 new full time positions created in CONANP in 2008, 152


13
     The sinking funds comprised the income from the endowment fund.



                                                   34
      supported work in the PAs, thereby increasing enormously its ability to provide
      basic support and operations at the PA level. By 2010, COANP had a total of
      1,762 staff working in 130 PAs.

   75. The Final Evaluation of SINAP II notes with respect to CONANP that “The
       institutional capacity of CONANP has clearly been improved by the Project.
       These individuals have developed a substantial knowledge base for effectively
       working with local communities. In addition, the central function has helped to
       promote greater use of feasibility studies prior to launching economic
       development projects and is working to improve marketing efforts once the
       infrastructure is in place. While these processes could still be improved the
       evaluators recognize the important role the central unit has played in setting
       quality standards for consultant selection, building economies of scale for
       marketing ecotourism efforts, and raising the capacity within CONANP for
       managing economic development projects.?

   76. With respect to FMCN/FANP, the Final Evaluation notes “The successful
       capitalization of the FANP has catapulted FMCN to be the largest, and one of the
       most respected, environmental trust funds in the developing world.?
       FMCN/FANP have developed a somewhat symbiotic relationship in which
       FANP’s growth has boosted FMCN’s reputation and capacity, which in turn has
       had a tremendous impact on fundraising efforts for the FANP endowment. Its
       conservative investment management strategy has served SINAP well.

   77. At the local, PA level, the Advisory Councils have provided an effective vehicle
       for working directly with PA stakeholders. The PCU has worked closely with
       the Advisory Councils, organized training courses, provided facilitators, and
       promoted learning networks. The IMAC (Mexican Conservation Learning
       Network) managed by FMCN provided facilitation and best practices support to
       Advisory Councils, although it has yet to become an established vehicle for
       learning and exchange among CSOs, as intended. IMAC has made a successful
       start in some areas such as initiating a fire management learning network
       (CAMAFU) and supporting training and exchanging of information on the subject.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

   78. With the objective to improve knowledge and exchange experiences related to the
       SINAP project, a PA Learning Community was developed through the FANP.
       The FANP finances Innovative Strategic Projects (PIE, for its initials in Spanish)
       that are implemented in close collaboration with the CONANP in the PAs of the
       Program. This opportunity of cooperation and coordination opens an
       extraordinary window to create synergies and networks between the Civil Society
       Organizations (NGOs) and the public sector (CONANP) at the local, regional and
       national level. Particularly, sharing experiences and lessons learned in the
       planning, methodology, implementation and other aspects related to
       environmental issues for the conservation of the PAs. In July 2009, FMCN held



                                          35
       the workshop “Strengthening Alliances for the Conservation of Protected Areas?
       as part of its first Week for the Interchange of Conservation Knowledge, and one
       of the conclusions of this event was the importance of establishing a joint work
       plan for CONANP and the civil society organizations working in FANP’s 23
       protected areas. As a result, it was decided to initiate the Protected Area Learning
       Community through a four day workshop in August 2010. The results of the
       workshop were: (i) share of experiences and lessons learnt from the above
       mentioned PIEs through presentations of case studies and consequent discussions:
       (ii) define the mission, vision and objective of the created Protected Area
       Learning Community (CAAP); (iii) define strategic objectives for each of the
       strategic areas of learning; (iv) state that the communication strategy for the
       learning community will be through an online portal and participatory workshops
       (see Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible

   79. The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Negligible. SINAP II built on
       an already successful program and made an enormous impact on the GOM’s
       capacity to manage the SINAP. A successful public-private partnership, where
       both the public and private sides are aligned and work together to complement
       and improve each other’s performance, tied with an effective, functioning
       structure at the PA level that ensures community, civil society and other local
       involvement in priority-setting and implementation, is established and functioning
       well.

   80. Mexico’s commitment to SINAP has been steadfast since the creation of the
       system. The Government has continuously demonstrated its commitment to
       SINAP not only through capital contributions to FANP, but also through
       increased budgetary allocations over the years.    More importantly, the
       Government’s commitment has been continuous, now spanning three Presidential
       administrations.

   81. The FMCN/FANP has developed a fantastic reputation both nationally and
       internationally, and is well endowed and conservatively managed. The flow of
       project funds from the FANP is likely to be sustained, and even increased, over
       the longer-term. FMCN/FANP has proven the ability to mobilize large sums of
       resources in support of conservation efforts. The FMCN now manages the largest
       conservation trust fund portfolio in the world, valued at $106,105,381 in
       December 2009. Annual interest from FANP ranges from US$3.7 to US$4.3
       million range, ensuring the availability of funding to Mexico’s PAs. The effective
       collaboration among NGOs/CSOs, academic institutions and the private sector
       more broadly, in collaboration with the local communities themselves have
       embraced the importance of conservation, and of developing sustainable
       development activities that offer alternative options that support biodiversity



                                           36
       conservation. At the start of the Project, PAs counted on project funding to meet
       up to 30 percent of their annual operating budgets. At completion, this figures
       was reduced to about 8 percent in view of the GOM’s increased commitment to
       SINAP.

   82. The Independent evaluation of SINAP II concludes that “The strength of this
       public-private dialogue and the commitment with which CTFANP, FMCN and
       CONANP work to ensure solid coordination and alignment is an excellent
       harbinger for the continued success of FANP funds after Bank supervision ends?.
       Further, it mentions “this project is recognized internationally, and has had a
       demonstration effect in terms of best practices for environmental funds?.

   83. Perhaps the greatest threat to biodiversity conservation in Mexico relates to illicit
       activities that are not being policed by the appropriate authorities due to lack of
       staff and budget. As the PA staff has no authority in making arrests in these cases,
       they can only resort to denouncing wrongdoings. This may be an area for priority
       attention in the future.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

   84. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. The Project
       was essentially a continuation of the Highly Satisfactory rated SINAP I. However,
       there were several design factors that worked to make the Project’s
       implementation successful, and contribute to its achieving its development
       objectives. First, the Bank’s team was responsive in proposing a lending
       instrument that responded to GEF funding constraints while still ensuring that
       project funding would be made available to finance additional PAs in phases, as
       and when funding became available, counterpart resources were mobilized, and
       social assessments concluded. At the same time, project funding for initial work
       in all 12 SINAP II PAs was made available up front in order to ensure that once
       additional PAs were incorporated under the Project through staged capitalization
       of FANP, arrangements for their implementation were advanced. The flexibility
       that was built into the matching funds requirements, as described in Section 2.1
       made for a successful resource mobilization effort in support of SINAP II.
       Finally, the Project’s results framework, which was similar to that used to monitor
       PA’s progress towards their own priority objectives in their five-year plans and
       POAs, provided a rather simple, but comprehensive framework through which to
       evaluate progress in implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                           37
   85. Bank Quality of Supervision is also rated Satisfactory. The Bank provided
       tremendous continuity in supervision—one Task Manager was responsible for the
       Project from early implementation through completion. The Bank set high
       standards for implementation, and consistently maintained a long-term vision with
       focus on results, building capacity, involving stakeholders and efficient
       administration. Supervision was also flexible and adaptive to emerging realities.
       When additional funding became available to CONANP, the Bank supported
       CONANP in its efforts to provide increasing support to PAs for basic operations,
       while working closely with all partners to determine how the additional funding
       could best be used to further the Project’s development objectives. The
       Independent evaluation of SINAP II notes that “World Bank supervision was
       consistently cited by interviewees for fomenting the long-term capacity of the
       partners to effectively manage protected areas and work together to leverage
       results and innovation in the field?.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating:

   86. The Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on similar ratings for
       Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision, and especially for its
       important, catalytical role in the Project’s significant contribution to the
       consolidation of the SINAP in Mexico.



5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

   87. The GOM’s performance is rated Satisfactory. It has maintained continuous
       commitment to the SINAP program since its establishment, across presidential
       administrations that involved different political parties. During implementation,
       this commitment was evidenced, not only in the close working relationship with
       FMCN, but also through a strong financial commitment both to the FANP
       endowment and to CONANP. The Government’s US$8.5 million commitment to
       the FANP endowment served as a confirmation of the Govenrment’s trust in the
       fund, its management and the programs it supported that has an important
       demonstrative impact that should greatly facilitate future fund-raising efforts. In
       addition to the federal government, two state governments—the States of Mexico
       and Michoacán—also contributed funds to FANP, providing evidence of their
       commitment to their PAs and trust in FMCN. The increased budgetary funding
       that the GOM assigned to CONANP for hiring an additional 991 full-time staff, as
       civil service employees, is further evidence of its commitment to SINAP.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance



                                            38
Rating: Satisfactory

   88. The Implementing Agencies’ Performance (FMCN and CONANP) is rated
       Satisfactory. CONANP demonstrated strong implementation capacity, evolving
       during implementation in response to increased support in the form of budget and
       staff, seizing new opportunities that this created, training its new staff,
       emphasizing a results culture through investments in M&E and corresponding
       training, and working with the Project’s PAs and NGOs/CSOs to foment a culture
       of partnership for conservation. FMCN/FANP has consolidated it national and
       international reputatation as a well- and conservatively-managed conservation
       trust fund, with transparent procedures, that reaches out to build partnerships,
       support capacity building, provide coordination and advice to public and private
       partners alike input to national policies. Throughout implementation it remained
       commited to managing the FANP endowment in full coordination with CONANP
       priorities, including those of the PA Directors.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

   89. The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on similar ratings
       by the Government and the main implementing agencies, and also based on the
       dedication, commitment and contribution of all who participated, including the
       PA Directors, social promoters, NGOs/CSOs who were able to successfully work
       with and engage beneficiaries in PA communities that contributed to the Project’s
       achievements.

6. Lessons Learned

   90. There are numerous lessons learned from this successful project that has become a
       best-practice example of an environmental trust fund. These include:

   91. On project design and the grant instrument:

    The phased approach to incorporating PAs under the grant instrument, with
     technical support for all PAs provided in the first phase, followed by the
     incorporation of activities for additional PAs under subsequent phases that were
     processed in accordance with pre-agreed procedures, was particularly well suited
     for the SINAP II Project. The provision of technical support up front ensured that
     once additional phases were approved, their activities were ready for
     implementation.
    Providing flexibility during implementation to adjust design to emerging realities
     (in this case the increased Government funding of SINAP) within broad
     objectives allows opportunties for maximizing project impact. The PIE projects
     were an example of the flexibility that was provided under the Project.

   92. On the Endowment and Institutional Arrangements:


                                           39
 Public private partnerships can provide an effective, mutually beneficial vehicle
  that capitalizes on the best that each of the partners have to provide. Private funds
  are better suited to fundraising, funds management, investment, and ensuring
  proper application and control. The public involvement ensures coordination with
  Govenrment priorities, and a visable platform through which public endorsement
  of the partnership can be provided. In this respect, Government investment in a
  conservation fund can have a significant impact in terms of signaling strong
  Government support to the public-private partnership.
 Conservative management of endowment funds, coupled with clear policy
  mandates, and transparent processes are critical to ensure credibility, which in
  turn enhances the funds’ stature, thereby improving prospects for fund raising.
 Securing endowment counterpart funds could be enhanced by: a) flexibility in
  allowing for a larger number of PAs to be considered within the match is an
  important draw for private foundations; b) government agencies are not best
  suited for raising funds for private endowments but their endorsement is critical;
  c) a strong advisory body provides an important venue for ensuring ongoing
  alignment between public and private partners while still recognizing institutional
  autonomy for the private entity.

93. On Impacts/Outcomes:

 It is possible to measure habitat transformation, but results will likely only be
  measurable if measured annually, over time. Information on fire management in
  PAs can provide useful information, especially since fires are one of the major
  threats to biodiversity.
 More work needs to be done on establishing strategies for measuring species
  populations.
 Although CONANP has put in place processes for measuring outcomes, it does
  not have the ability to address threats since this requires strong coordination with
  other Government agencies that are often understaffed and underfunded.

94. On Protected Area management with social responsibility:

 Protected Area Councils are an important tool for developing the culture of
  conservation and for stakeholder participation. The success of the Councils tends
  to depend to a large degree on the interest and inputs of the PA Director. Thus, the
  training of PA Directors in the establishment and nurturing of PA Councils is a
  key factor in improving their functioning and output.
 Federal, state, and municipal agencies are perhaps the largest untapped resource
  for improving the management of PAs through the funding of IDSs, the
  harmonization of environmental policies, law enforcement, etc., and creative
  ways need to be found to harness this potential.
 The energy invested in the evaluation of Environmental Impact Assessments
  (EIAs) not only pays dividends in avoiding environmental impacts and




                                        40
     sustainability issues, but also provides early opportunities to encourage
     biodiversity offsets.
    The development of zero green house gas PAs provides an opportunity not only to
     demonstrate how infrastructure and transportation systems can be developed to
     minimize the emission of green house gases, but could also be used as a means of
     generating funding for infrastructure and transportation through carbon offsets.


   95. On sustainable activities and community relations in PAs:

    “Quality of Life? projects can be effective in offsetting the resource use
     limitations imposed by protected area status even though such projects may not
     generate cash income.
    An important the criteria for selecting community subprojects should be the
     degree to which they fit into regional networks that can provide support services,
     economies of scale, opportunities for collective marketing, and integration into
     the local economy. This is especially true of projects related to tourism.
    Though it is too early to gauge the success of the productive subprojects
     themselves, some quick lessons have been learned with respect to the grant-
     making process. From that standpoint, these type of projects are most successful
     when: a) they require counterpart funding from the implementing organization; b)
     focus on critical management issues; c) well functioning projects are extended
     over a number of years; and,d) there is strong interaction between the PA
     management team and the implementing organization.
    Universities can often play a key role in providing technical support for the design,
     implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these types of projects.
    Multi-year funding is critical for successful implementation and sustainability of
     projects. Annually funded government programs might also benefit from multi-
     year project design.

   96. On monitoring of biodiversity and habitat loss indicators:

    CONANP has recruited a core PA staff, developed management programs,
     undertaken substantial outreach and has engaged with local communities in all
     PAs visited. This presence and stafftime has been critically important in
     improving the opportunities for PA biodiversity conservation.
    Habitat transformation data is most useful as a management effectiveness
     indicator if systematically provided on an annual or biannual basis.
    Systematic fire data can prove remarkably useful for evolving management
     strategies in forested systems, particularly when agricultural burns are one of the
     biggest threats to the PA.
    Species population surveys need to be more closely organized with PA Directors
     to help improve their relevance for PA management strategies.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners


                                           41

   97. The National Commission for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) reviewed the
       draft ICR and provided comments on December 6, 2010 (see Annex 5). The
       agency agreed with the report’s findings. In addition, the Commission noted that
       this operation supported the agency in its initial stages and strengthened the
       institutional capacity, particularly in their strategy for conservation. It also
       mentions that the Project’s Social Strategy was mainstreamead into the Agency’s
       programs and projects. CONANP commends the Bank for the steady support
       obtained from the Project team and emphasizes the importance of field visits and
       constant support of Bank staff. The understanding of the dynamics of local
       communities in Mexico and the technical expertise provided on monitoring of
       project impacts are described as “invaluable?.

   98. The Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature (FMCN) also reviewed the
       draft ICR and provided comments on December 3, 2010 (see Annex 5). The
       agency agreed with the report’s findings. The Fund commented that the turnover
       of task managers diminished in comparison to the previous project (SINAP I),
       “giving stability and continuity to the implemented actions. Plans were made and
       followed to allow for improved coordination and increased learning during the
       supervision missions. Time for response was reduced to a minimum, while
       professional advice was available at all times.? The professionalism and
       experience of the Bank team was highlithed and the “valuable incorporation of the
       lessons learned from SINAP I into the implementation of SINAP II, which
       brought very positive effects?, was commended. The opportunity to learn from
       similar projects from around the world thanks to the Bank and the incorporation
       of planning, monitoring and evaluation procedures mentored by the Bank that
       have now become streamlined procedures for the SINAP II and other projects of
       the FMCN were also mentioned as “highly appreciated?. The Bank team was also
       commended for the “adaptive management?, which “unfolded due to rigorous
       analysis of the problems at hand, exploration of alternatives, respect for a
       diversity of opinions and consensus building?.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: Expansion of the Fund for Natural Protected Areas

 1.1       The selected protected areas show progress in the results of their Annual
            Operating Plans
 1.2       Resources available at local levels for management of selected PAs are increased

           Indicators:
               Percentage of planned results at the PA level that show at least 80%
                  progress in their indicators
               Percentage of resources for conservation mobilized at the PA level
               Actual rate of increase in resources per PA, per year

      1.     POAs for the PAs were prepared according to a participatory process, using a
           results framework with baselines and targets that are the basis for bi-annual and
           annual reporting. For POAs, the CONANP staff ensures that there is a five-year
           planning framework (the Management Program), at the level of objective and
           expected results with relevant indicators. The POAs are based on this five-year
           planning framework, and present the annual activities that are expected to produce
           each result. The PIEs follow the same planning process. Both processes are
           described in FANP’s Operational Manual. The semi-annual and annual reporting
           on POAs and PIEs report on the advances during the period in accordance with the
           established indicators. As a result, 100 percent of the resources from FANP are
           monitored based on pre-defined and agreed indicators.               According to
           CONANP/FANP’s monitoring there was at least 88 percent progress towards the
           objectives of the POAs and 86 percent progress towards objectives of the PIEs.

      2.    Total resources from FANP, CONANP and others at local levels for
           management of the PAs increased substantially from MP$12,564,700 in 2002 to
           MP$164,388,404 in 2009.

1.3        Capital resources for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use increase

           Indicators:
               National: Amount of funds raised for the Project
               Local level: Amount of funds raised for local endowments for PAs

      3.     FANP was established in 1997 with a GEF contribution of US$16.48 million to
           support 10 PAs. Since then, FANP’s capital has increased 4.6 times to
           US$75,891,291 through the contributions from 14 donors to support 23 PAs. The
           matching funds raised for the Project’s contribution of US$22.5 million totaled
           US$29,946,834, exceeding the 1:1 matching requirement by US$7,418,627 two
           years before completion. With the exception of the GOM’s US$7.5 million

           contribution, the remaining contributions were targeted to specific PAs. Annex 11
           presents a summary of contributions made to FANP throughout implementation of
           the Project.

Component 2: Protected Area Conservation Programs

2.1        Knowledge on sustainable use in the PAs is increased

           Indicator:
               Proportion of PAs where the percentage of the population that knows what
                  a PA is, has increased

      5.     In order to promote a better understanding of biodiversity and the need for
           conservation, and to promote participation and disseminate results, one of the
           conditions for obtaining FANP support to the POAs was the inclusion of activities
           for communication and promotion, with goals and targets. The specific objective
           was to increase the percentage of persons in the PAs that know the value of the
           PAs, as well as the importance of sustainable use. Performance among different
           PAs varied but overall there was sustained progress towards this objective.
           Throughout different phases of implementation CONANP/FANP, through the PA


                                                 45
           coordinators, supported communication activities and workshops targeted at
           students in local schools, audiovisual clips on conservation and sustainable use,
           preparation of materials on the subject, events on environmental education,
           meetings with the community members living in the PAs and surroundings,
           celebrating a national conservation week. In 2002-2003, population in the four
           PAs included in the first phase already know what a PA was. As additional PAs
           were incorporated, continued efforts resulted in similar results. By completion,
           population in all 12 PAs knew what PAs were.

2.2        Protected areas, public and private institutions, and social organizations have
           more personnel trained in planning, design and implementation of sustainable
           projects

           Indicators:
               Number of persons involved in sustainable use projects
               Number of projects successfully implemented
               Number of PAs where traditional sustainable practices are maintained

      6.     Between 1998 and 2008, FANP resources were channeled in large part to hiring
           personnel in the PAs through the POAs. Most of these personnel were trained in
           planning, design and implementation of sustainable projects. With the growth of
           CONANP’s staffing, 52 persons were incorporated as FONANP staff in 2008.
           CONANP witnessed an enormous increase in its staff from 577 in 2004 to 1,562 in
           2010. Under the Project, CONANP hired 11 coordinators trained in implementing
           sustainable projects in the PAs. The Project was successful in increasing the
           number of staff trained in sustainable projects.

      7.     In 2009, FANP started providing direct support to Strategic Innovation Projects
           (PIEs) implemented by CSOs in the Project’s PAs. In 2009, 11 PIE were
           implemented in 11 PAs, and in 2010 14 PIEs are under implementation in 8 PAs.
           These PIEs have all achieved, on average, 86 percent of their expected results.
           Throughout implementation, 60 IDS were implemented in 11 PAs (and in an
           additional PA not included in the Project, RB Pantanos de Centla). At present, 54
           of these IDS are under implementation. Six of them were discontinued due to
           internal conflicts among the communities, lack of commitment of the communities
           or delays in transferring resources to them.

Component 3: System-wide Institutional Strengthening


3.1        Opportunities for social participation in conservation and sustainable use and
           biodiversity are increased

           Indicators:
               At least one participatory forum functioning effectively




                                               46
          Number of conservation initiatives where local communities participate in
           the design and/or execution
          Number of NGOs, universities, research centers and social sectors
           participating in conservation and management of the PAs
          Number of people attending participatory forums on sustainable use and
           conservation

8.     The Advisory Committees (AC) of each PA assist and support the staff assigned
     to the PAs in their conservation and management. The CAs are composed of
     representatives of different sectors involved in the PA, which provides for social
     participation in the management of the PA. In accordance with the Reglamento de
     la Ley General de Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente (LGEEPA)
     the ACs are required to hold meetings at least once a year, and prepare minutes
     recording the agreements reached. Each AC has at least 21 members, and requires
     a majority as a quorum for its meetings.

9.     FANP’s support to a POA is conditioned on written evidence of the participation
     of the respective AC, or alternative participatory mechanism. The reports that
     document the use of FANP resources in the implementation of PAs must be
     presented to the ACs or other for a. Written evidence of this presentation is a
     condition for a subsequent disbursement to the PA. Throughout implementation,
     FANP’s central coordination staff that monitors the POAs must verify that this
     requirement is met. As a result, at least one participatory forum is functioning
     effectively in each PA financed by the Project throughout implementation.

10. The participation of CSO, universitites, research centers and social sectors is
   fundamental to generate information aimed at mobilizing academic and social
   support that allows channeling efforts, implement and in some cases redirect the
   conservation strategy of the PA. The involvement of these types of organizations
   has grown exponentially since 2002, especially among the category of “other? that
   includes the private sector, which account for 55 in 2009, providing a strong
   indication of their desire to participate in environmental sustainability activities.

11. The phased entry of new PAs in the Project was paralleled by the increase in the
  number of new “partners? associated with the PAs. Between 2005 and 2006 when
  the number of PAs increased from 5 to 8 (60 percent increase), the number of
   universities and research centers increased from 34 to 53 (55 percent), of CSOs
   from 34 to 59 (74 percent), of social sectors from 24 to 51 (113 percent) and other
   institutions from 5 to 22 (340 percent). By 2010, the number of outside
   institutions participating in conservation and management of the PAs totaled 88
   universities and research centers, 93 CSOs, 85 social sector organizations and 55
   others.

3.2      Principles and objectives of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are
         gradually adopted by PA stakeholders

         Indicators:
             Proportion of Management Program components where stakeholders
                participate
             Number of agreements between stakeholders and CONANP
             Number of conservation initiatives where stakeholders participate in the
                design and/or execution

      12. Some of the PA Management Programs are under different stages of
        implementation. Because of this, the results frameworks of each of the POAs of
        the Project’s PAs were used as input to this indicator. The results frameworks are
        based on the decree, the Management Programs and other planning instruments.
        The results frameworks of the PAs involve a five-year planning which permits
        monitoring the principle results with specific indicators for which targets are to be
        met in this period. To make progress towards those targets, beneficiary
        participation is essential.

      13. Table 5 presents the proportion of Management Program results frameworks in
         which the stakeholders such as local communities, ejidatarios, owners and other
         participate in the implementation and conservation efforts. This information is
         reported in each PAs’ POA twice a year. The results frameworks cover two
         distinct strategies: one conservation and the other social. The number of results in


                                              48
        the PAs’ respective results frameworks varied from 6 in some PAs to 12 in
        another. On average, stakeholders participated in 87 percent of results, of which
        48 percent corresponded to social strategies.

Component 4: Mainstreaming Conservation and Sustainable Use Policies

4.1      Legal bases have been established between agencies strengthening the inclusion
         of criteria in sectoral policies

         Indicators:
             Number of legal bases for intersectoral coordination, signed and under
                operation
             Five inter-institutional agreements to implement sectorial programs at the
                PA level


      14. Thorugh a study called “Development and Inclusion of Environmental Criteria
         and Components in the sectorial programs of Sagarpa, SRA, Sedesol, SCT y SSA?
         opportunities to incluence in the operationg rules of the 5 mentioned secretaries
        were identified. Part of the conclusions of that study pointed out that, due to the
        obligation of the the Rules of Operation of federal programs to execute the
        resources in a deentralized way, it was recommended to concrete the contributions
        thourgh local agreements. In thet sense, the largest confluence of resources in the
        Sustainable development Initiatives was reached at the Protected Area Levek, as
        they obtained support from secteratries like Sagarpa and Sedesol and from state
        and municipal entities. The amount of the contribution represented 4.2% of the
        total investment.

    15. Additionally a Project Articulation of Synergy Strategues and concurrence for
       the Conservation and the Sustainable development was carried out and derived in
       an agreement with the FIRCO (The trusteeship of shared risk), a promoting agency
       dependen ton the SAGARPA, in which framework 13 projects of & NPA were
       presented. The agreemtent between CONANP and FIRCO was signed in July 2005.
4.2     Planning mechanisms for increasing sustainable development in PAs have been
        established

         Indicator:
             Number of PAs with development projects or intersectorial initiatives that
                incorporate biodiversity-friendly criteria

      16. In the 12 PAs, the development projects or the intersectorial initiatives include
         compatible criteria with biodiversity. Regarding investments coordinated and
         managed mainly by other entities, by law they present environmental impact
         statements in the corresponding varieties, and those, in order to be authorized
         require the clearance of the field personnel from the CONANP, including
         recommendations towards the conservation of biodiversity in the NPA.

4.3      Financing from institutions other than CONANP directed toward conservation
         and sustainable use in the protected areas is increased

             Percentage of annual increase in additional support, in cash or in kind,
                coming from institutions other than CONANP.
             Number of agencies not focused on environment that provide support
                relevant to the Project

    17. During the instrmentation of the Project the investments from other institutions
       others tan CONANP at the beginning of the Project represented 50% of the
       investment, not taking into account the contribution of SINAP II. In 2008, a year
       before the conclusion of the project’s investment, this percentage reached 68%, the
      decrease in 2009 is explained by the reduction in investment in the last execution
      period.

    18. The contributions of agencies non-directly related to the conservation of
       biodiversity represented approximately 4% of the channeled investments to the
       sustainable development initiatives. Those contributions were made by CDI,
       Indesol y and the state and municiapl governments’ mainly Nevertheless it is
       important to mention that the investmens from other sources different tan the
       Project, including the commnties, represented 54.7%.

Annex 4. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


The workshop was held from August 310th to September 2nd 2010 in Mexico City. The
development of the workshop and the main results are described as follows:

Workshop objectives:
The objective of the workshop was to share those lessons and design the Learning
Community of the PA (CAAP, for its initials in Spanish). This CAAP is conformed by
the Protected Areas Management Areas (23) and all the NGOs that work with FANP (23).
In this first participatory workshop the stakeholders worked together to: 1) define the
strategic framework of the CAAP (mission, vision, general and specific objective, key
thematic areas to work at), 2) establish communication mechanisms and 3) assign
responsible persons to follow up on each defined strategic line of action.

Participants:
Representatives from 23 civil society organizations presented advances and lessons
learned from projects in progress. An average of 50 people attended the workshop every
day. They included representatives from national, regional and local CONANP offices.
FMCN participated with representatives from its Forests, Marine and Coastal, Leadership
and Protected Areas programs.

Contents and Results of the Workshop:

   2. Design of the Protected Area Learning Community (CA-AP)

Definition of the Learning Community

Working through a network is a process in which two or more organizations or
individuals collaborate to reach common goals. Learning communities are a type of
network that seeks to advance knowledge about a specific region or theme. Learning
communities are distinguished from networks in that they specifically seek to establish
long-term learning processes that advance and strengthen innovation, capacity
development, practices, and links between actors involved in distinct areas. Participants
at the workshop defined that the objective that unites them is to strengthen the capacities
of the members to improve performance in protected areas through the interchange of
experiences and lessons learned, CA-AP can best be thought of as a learning community.
They proceeded to define the mission, vision, objective and specific objectives of the
CA-AP. They divided into groups according to specific objectives of their interest and
defined an action plan for each specific objective. The central coordination will prioritize
the activities of each plan to fund them in the next three years with FANP funds and
counterpart sources.

Mission
The Protected Area Learning Community (CA-AP) is a group willing to share knowledge,
experience and methods for the benefit of the conservation and sustainable management
of the ecosystems and biodiversity of protected areas.

Vision
CA-AP is an inclusive and highly participatory group of learning leaders that shares
experiences and generates alliances that promote new conservation and sustainable
management strategies for protected areas.

Objective
Strengthen the capacity of the members of the Protected Areas Learning Community to
improve performance in the protected areas through the interchange of experience and
knowledge.

Specific Objectives by Strategic Area

   1. Comprehensive Management of Natural Resources Writing facilitator: Angélica
      Jiménez of Fundación MABIO AC and Natalie Rodríguez of CONANP.
         o Share practices and experiences related to the management of natural
            resources in order to promote innovate strategies.

   2. Social Participation and Communication Writing facilitator: Gelacio Morga of
      Consejo de Recursos Naturales de la Región Cañada de Oaxaca, A. C.
         o Strengthen the capacity of the Protected Area Learning Community to
             ensure the participation of distinct actors impacting the ecosystems and
             their biodiversity.

   3. Environmental Legislation and Policy Writing facilitator: Israel Amezcua of
      Pronatura Sur A.C. and Angel Omar Ortíz of CONANP.
         o Share experiences and proposals relating to public policy and application
             of the law for management and conservation in the protected areas and
             their areas of influence.

   4. Strategic Planning – Monitoring - Evaluation (Management Effectiveness)
      Writing facilitator: Alberto Lafón of Profauna A.C. and Rocío Esquivel of
      CONANP.
          o Utilize an information, follow-up and evaluation system that permits
              members to learn about, systematize and spread activities and advances
              relevant to protected areas.


Next Steps:

It was decided that the communication strategy would be based on an online portal and
participatory workshops.
The next steps are to define the punctual issues to solve (e.g. invading species,
management effectiveness, conflict resolution etc,) as well as the subtopics, the scope of
the online portal and the conceptual community image.

    5.     Taking into consideration the correlations that were not statistically significant
          and including the indicator species that were monitored for only at least two years,
          it can be concluded that the frequency of observation for 78 percent of the
          indicator species monitored either increased or stayed the same in the PAs, while
          22 percent of the monitored species declined. Although the results are
          preliminary, and require a review to ensure that the methodology is consistent, as
          well as a need for greater knowledge of the species monitored, it is possible to
          conclude that the majority of the species populations monitored in the PAs under
          SINAP II either increased or were maintained.

       6.    The graphs below show examples of species in each of the groups (mammals,
            birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates and plants) for which frequency of
            observation was monitored under the Project, and which incorporated the most
            robust data and with the greatest continuity of monitoring. Some examples of
            possible success, such as the case of the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) of the
            RB La Encrucijada, the palma real (Dioon caputoi) of the RB Tehuacán –
            Cuicatlán, the mexcalpique (Girardinichtys multiradiatus) of the APFF
            Chichinautzin and the Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonorensis) in
            the RB El Pinacate. It also shows that species such as the palmoteador de Yuma
            (Rallus longirostris yumanensis) for which the population apparently increased
            and has been since maintained for over seven years. These tables also show that
            there may have been a decrease in populations of some species such as the ajolote
            (Ambystoma zempoalensis) of the APFF Chichinautzin and the caracol de
            Churince (Mexipyrgus churinceanus) in the APFF Cuatrociénegas.
