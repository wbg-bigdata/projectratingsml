       A. SUMMARY

1.      This restructuring package seeks your approval for a Level I restructuring of the
Nicaragua Off Grid Rural Electrification Project - PERZA (Credit No. IDA-3 760-NI and
GEF Grant No. TF51960 collectively referred to as the "Project") which includes a
trigger of OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement that the team considered necessary during
recent supervision.

2.      Two other changes included in the same package have been approved by the
Regional Vice President: an 18 month extension of the closing date, from June 30, 2010
to December 31, 2011 and a reallocation of credit and grant proceeds, as requested by the
Ministry of Finance of Nicaragua (see the attached request dated April 19, 2010). The
proposed changes would allow: (i) an additional 3,660 new electric services connections
to poor households in rural Nicaragua, (ii) a full disbursement of the remaining IDA
credits and GEF grant, and (iii) compliance with the Bank safeguards policies and
guidelines. The Development Objective of the Project would remain the same.

       B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The Project's Development Objective (PDO) is rated satisfactory, which is to
support the sustainable provision of electricity services and associated social and
economic benefits in selected rural sites in Nicaragua, and to strengthen the
Government's institutional capacity to implement its national rural electrification
strategy. The Project's Global Environmental Objective (GEO) is rated moderately
satisfactory, which is to achieve greenhouse gas reductions through the reduction of
policy, informational, financing and institutional capacity barriers that currently hinder
renewable energy technology (RET) dissemination and market development in
Nicaragua.

4.       The Overall Implementation Progress is rated moderately satisfactory. Although
disbursements of the IDA credits and GEF grant have been slower than desired,
implementation is on track to achieve the Project's objectives. Achievements of the
blended project so far include: (a) installation of 6,863 individual solar home systems
(SHS) to provide electricity to remote rural households, benefitting more than 41,000
people; (b) installation of seven solar photovoltaic charging stations; (c) completion of
three interconnections of isolated systems to the Interconnected National System, two of
which are supported with small hydro generation; (d) joint development with the
Government and other donors (IDB, CABEI, EIB, etc.) of the National Sustainable
Electrification and Renewable Energy Program, which aims to invest approximately
US$300 million to increase electricity coverage from 67% in 2010 to 84% in 2014; and
(e) a total of approximately 60,000 direct project beneficiaries in rural areas of Nicaragua
to date.

5.     As of April 5, 2010, US$10.9 million equivalent of the IDA credit and US$ 2.3
million of the GEF grant were disbursed. This leaves US$2.37 million of the IDA credit
and US$1.74 million of the GEF grant remaining to be disbursed. Disbursements of
                                             1
approximately US$ 0.52 million from the credit and US$ 0.56 million from the grant are
expected by the current closing date.


       C. PROPOSED CHANGES


Results/indicators


6.     Neither the PD~ nor the GEO would be changed through the restructuring. The
project team proposes to drop the monitoring and evaluation of the sector-related CAS
indicators from the results framework because they are beyond the scope of the project.
The results frameworks of the project follow the old PAD template and as a result,
include sector-related CAS indicators which are no longer required by the updated Bank
guidelines.

7.      There are 18 PD~ indicators in the original PAD. Not all of them are high-level
indicators and in fact, some are redundant with current output indicators. In this
restructuring, the project team proposes to drop 9 PD~ indicators, as they either apply to
activities beyond the project life or refer to pilot initiatives that will not have been
replicated in a larger scale during project implementation, and to incorporate 7 of the
PD~ indicators into output indicators. Only the two high-level PD~ indicators are
retained, including 1) adoption of a sustainable national rural electrification strategy by
the MEM and 2) at least 7,000 new connections with minigrids and individual systems
(including SHS and batteries) are made.

8.      There are 2 GEF Operational Program indicators and 2 GEO indicators, of which
only GEO indicator 1 (i.e. actual tons of C02 abated by pilot projects) has a clear target
value and time frame to achieve it. It is then proposed to (i) retain one GEO indicator
(actual tons of C02 abated by pilot projects, reaching a total of 10,000 tons by the end of
PERZA) in the results framework because it is clearly linked to the GEO and is
measureable and verifiable during the project life, (ii) incorporate GEF OP indicators
with GEO indicators since they are repetitive and redundant, and (iii) eliminate from the
results framework the GEF renewable energy projects replicability indicators that are not
quantifiable during the project life but whose trends of development will continue to be
monitored by the MEM after the project. It should be mentioned that even though some
pilot projects of PERZA are still under implementation, lessons emerged from the earlier
pilots of PERZA, including small hydro projects and the solar program, have been
studied by the government and other donors and incorporated into the recent development
of the national electrification program.

9.    The original indicators, proposed changes, and their justifications are shown in
Annex 1.




                                             2
Safeguards

10.     The team proposes to trigger OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement through this
restructuring. During the recent supervision, it was found that small scale resettlement
(i.e. no physical displacement of people) involving the acquisition of some private and
community land happened under the project. In this context, community land refers to the
land whose title is registered under a community organization. This was carried out in
compliance with the Nicaraguan law in the absence of a Bank's approved instrument
through the Project activities to date. The only subproject that involves indigenous people
is the solar central charging station in Francia Sirpi where only community land (no
private land) was used for housing the station. The choice of the location of the charging
station was done through a participatory process and in compliance with the Indigenous
People Development Plan and was finalized through a written agreement with
community members who are also beneficiaries of the project by receiving electricity
services through the project. OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural
Habitats) and OP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples), which were already triggered at project
approval, are still applicable. The assessment carried out by the Bank in March 2010
confirmed that there are no outstanding safeguard issues. An abbreviated resettlement
plan was prepared and disclosed in country on May 24, 2010 and at the Infoshop on May
20,2010.

Financing

11.      The restructuring proposes to (i) take advantage of an additional dollar amount of
US$ 1.35 million available due to the appreciation of SDR; and (ii) move some project
funds from technical assistance to investment activities under Component 2 Rural
Electrification Subprojects to speed up disbursements and maximize the Project's impact.
The proposed changes will not affect project performance in achieving the Project's
objective of expanding rural electricity services. Instead they will allow the project to
use the Project's funds more effectively toward achieving the PD~.

12.      The proposed reallocations do not introduce significant changes to the Project. It
represents a minor change in line with BP 13.05 (Project Supervision) and BP 13.25 (Use
of Project Cost Savings). Most of the changes involve the procedures for carrying out the
activities, not the activities per se.

13.     The level of financing for various project components as a result of the proposed
reallocations are illustrated in the following table:

                                                         (IDA in US$ million; 1 GEF in US$ million)

14.   The detailed reallocations by category of expenditure, both for the IDA credits
and GEF grant are shown in Annex 2.

Closing date

15.    With the proposed 18-month extension the project closing date for the project
would be extended from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This would be the second
extension of the project. The first extension was approved in November 2008 for 18
months. If the proposed extension is approved, the Project will be 8 years old at closing.

16.    Without the proposed extension, the Project would be expected to cancel an
estimated US$1. 85 million of the loan and US$1.18 million of the grant. As a result, it
would fail to provide electricity to approximately 3,660 households or 20,760 people.

17.     Additional time is required to ensure that the Project's objectives are achieved and
all in-country activities are brought to a successful and logical conclusion. The project
objectives continue to be achievable, the performance of the project team in the Ministry
of Energy and Mines (MEM) is satisfactory, and the MEM has prepared a feasible
implementation plan indicating activities to be undertaken during the extension period.

18.    The performance of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the implementing agency,
has been satisfactory and there are no outstanding audits for this project.


         D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Safeguards

19.    The same environmental and social framework developed for the original project
will be used. The MEM/PERZA team, with the support received from the MEM/UGA
and MARENA on environmental issues, has the implementation capacity required to
continue ensuring compliance of the project activities with Bank's safeguards.

                                                  4
20.     As part of the safeguards review in March 2010, the Bank team visited 4 sub-
projects in order to verify that compliance with environmental and social safeguards had
been adequately addressed during project implementation. The three safeguard policies
that were triggered at project appraisal (OP/BP 4.01, OPIBP 4.04 and OP/BP 4.20) will
continue to be applicable during the extended project implementation period and the
existing safeguard instruments will provide the necessary guidance to the MEM/PERZA
team.

21.     OPIBP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement - was not triggered at appraisal. However,
during the recent supervision, the Bank team confirmed that small scale resettlement has
happened during project implementation and, as a result, it was recommended that the
policy should be triggered. This resettlement, which does not involve physical
displacement of people, has involved the acquisition of some private and community land
and was carried out in compliance with the Nicaraguan law in the absence of a Bank's
approved instrument. The Bank took action by (i) indicating applicability of the policy,
(ii) sending a mission to Nicaragua to identify any existing gaps between implementation
and Bank's requirements, and (iii) requesting to the counterpart (MEM/PERZA team) the
preparation of an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan.

22.     The MEMIPERZA team has already submitted to the Bank the Abbreviated
Re~ettlement Plan, together with supporting documentation such as detailed lists of
affected land-owners, including land area affected and method used for land acquisition
(i.e. purchase, donation or easements), for the sub-projects. The Plan and the supporting
documentation have been considered acceptable by the Bank. It is expected that
compliance with OP/BP 4.12 will not encounter significant difficulties in the extended
implementation period.

                                 Results Framework and Monitoring

                   Nicaragua: Off Grid Rural Electrification Project (PERZA)

1.      There is no change to the project development objective, which is to support the sustainable
provision of electricity services and associated social and economic benefits in selected rural sites in
Nicaragua, and strengthen the Government's institutional capacity to implement its national rural
electrification strategy.

2.     There is no change to the project's global environmental objective, which is to achieve
greenhouse gas reductions through the reduction of policy, informational, financing and institutional
capacity barriers that currently hinder renewable energy technology (RET) dissemination and market
development in Nicaragua (GEF Operational Program No.6).

3.     The results frameworks of the project follows the old PAD template and include sector-related
CAS indicators, outcome/impact indicators for PDO/GEO and output indicators for each project
component. Since monitoring and evaluation of the sector-related CAS indicators are beyond the
scope of the project, we propose these indicators are eliminated.

4.      There are 18 PD~ indicators in the original PAD. Not all of them are high-level indicators and
in fact, some are redundant with current output indicators. In this restructuring, the project team
proposes to drop 9 PD~ indicators, as they either apply to activities beyond the project life or refer to
pilot initiatives that will not have been replicated in a larger scale during project implementation, and
to incorporate 7 of the PD~ indicators into output indicators. Only the two high-level PD~ indicators
are retained, including (i) adoption of a sustainable national rural electrification strategy by the MEM
and (ii) at least 7,000 new connections with minigrids and individual systems (including SHS and
batteries) are made.

5.      There are 2 GEF OP indicators - 1.) increased number of renewable energy technology
projects in Nicaragua and 2) quantity of C02 emissions avoided - and 2 GEO indicators - 1) actual
tons of C02 abated by pilot projects, reaching a total of 10,000 tons by the end of PERZA and 2)
estimated C02 abatement through replication of project pilots on a large scale. Only GEO 1 has a
clear target value and time frame to achieve it. Moreover, these two sets of indicators are repetitive. It
is then proposed to (i) retain one GEO indicator (actual tons of C02 abated by pilot projects, reaching
a total of 10,000 tons by the end of PERZA) in the results framework because it is clearly linked to
the GEO and is measureable and verifiable during the project life, (ii) incorporate GEF OP indicators
with GEO indicators since they are repetitive and redundant, and (iii) eliminate from the results
framework the GEF renewable energy projects replicability indicators that are not quantifiable but
whose trends of development will continue to be monitored by the MEM both during and after the
project. It should be mentioned that even though some pilot projects of PERZA are still under
implementation, lessons emerged from the earlier pilots of PERZA, including small hydro projects
and the solar program, have been studied by the government and other donors and incorporated into
the recent development of the national electrification program.

                     Nicaragua Off Grid Rural Electrification Project - PERZA

1.      The proposed reallocations for CREDIT 3760-NI involve shifting some resources originally
allocated for the provision of technical assistance to defray the increased capital costs of the
remaining two major subprojects - Wiwili and La Florida hydro projects - and the increased cost of
project management due to the longer project life. Some resources originally allocated for provision
of technical assistance and preparation of new investment activities are no longer necessary because
the preparation of the Wiwili and La Florida subprojects was partially financed by the government
and the concerned concessionaires. Since most of the proposed adjustments involve activities in the
same components, the subsequent changes to the levels of financing for various project components
are minimal.

3.      The proposed reallocations for GEF Grant TF051960 involve a reduction of resources
originally allocated for the provision of technical assistance to the development of a local solar PV
market and improvement of related regulatory framework and policies. Given the success of the
Project to date, with 6,800 solar home systems already installed, additional technical assistance
needed is limited relative to the remaining resources. It is proposed to use the remaining resources to
instead partially subsidize more solar home systems targeting poorer households ofthe rural poor.

4.      The table below shows the proposed reallocations of the proceeds for GEF Grant TF051960:

5.      The Project's PD~ is rated satisfactory and GEO is rated moderately satisfactory. While
disbursement of the credit and the grant has been slower than desired, implementation is well on the
way to achievement of the project objectives, with about 60,000 rural people having already benefited
directly from the project.

6.      As of April 5, 2010, US$10.9 million equivalent of the IDA credit and US$ 2.3 million of the
GEF grant were disbursed, while US$2.37 million of the IDA credit and US$1.74 million of the GEF
grant remain to be disbursed. Disbursements of approximately US$ 0.52 million from the credit and
US$ 0.56 million from the grant are expected by the current closing date.

7.     The proposed reallocations are necessary to (i) take advantage of additional dollar amount of
US$ 1.35 million available due to the appreciation of SDR; and (ii) move some project funds from
technical assistance to investment activities under Component 2 Rural Electrification Subprojects to
speed up disbursements and maximize the Project's impact.
