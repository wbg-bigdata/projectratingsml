PRESIDENT OF THE INTERATIIU&L
DEVEOIPENT ASSOCI&TIOM TO Tin
EZECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CRrIT TO THE RWANDSE REPUBLIC FOR  N
AGRICULTMRAL SRVICES PROJECT
1.          The following report on a proposed development credit to Rwanda for
SDR 15.5 million (US$ 19.9 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would finance the
reorganization of agricultural services in Rwanda.
i.          Background: With a population density of 250 persons per km2 (400
per km2 of arable land) Rwanda is the most densely settled country in continental
Africa. Its estimated population of 6.0 million is growing at a rapid annual
rate of 3.7 percent. Agriculture is the mainstay of tho economy contributing
about 80 percent of the total value of exports and 40 percent of GDP at current
prices. As much as 95 percent of the population lives in the rural areas. The
agriculture sector performed relatively well until 1983 with growth rates of 5.8
percent per annum between 1974-1980 and 3.5 percent per annum between 1980-1983.
Food production appears to have kept up with population growth until 1985. In
1986 the growth rate of the fooderop sector fell to about 3 percent. The most
important factor in the blow down in agricultural growth is the pressure of
population on scarce land resources. Over half the 1 million farm holdings are
less than 1 ha. Fallow land is in limited supply and there is overgrazing by
livestock. Farmers have so far managed to increase overall production through
area exp&asion and increased cropping intensities but with limited use of modern
inputs. As a result, soil fertility Is threatened and there is indeod evidence
that yields for most crops are at best stagnant. With the possibilities for area
expansion and Increased cropping intensity coming to an end, indications are that
future increases most come from productivity gains. To achieve this goal, the
development of relevant agricultural technology and its dissemination through
better agricultural support services Is essential. Agricultural services in
Rwanda (extension, adaptive and on-farm research, input supply, marketing) are
poorly organised and underdeveloped.  Extension is characterized by  poorly
coordinated donor interventions, unwieldy institutional and financial structures,
and ill-adapted themes.  Adaptive research is insufficient in qnantity and
quality and the use of modern inputs is limited. Local and interregional trade
is insufficiently developed partly because of the small private sector and an
inward looking -- subsistence oriented -- outlook by both Government and farmers.
3.          The  IDA   financed  Gitarama  Agricultural  ProductionIMINAGRI
Institutional Strengthening project (Cr. 1669-RW) which becam effective
September 1986 was prepared to respond to the above problems. The objective of
the Gitarama component was to test, on a pilot basis, a modified T&V extension
system adapted to local conditions which could be replicable on a national basis.
An additional aspect was the promotion of private sector participation in input
supply and marketing. The Gitarama project has been largely successful to date
and important lessons have been learned such as the need to more clearly define



- 2 -
and develop adaptive research, the importance of an effective internal monitoring
and evaluation system and the need to streamline the agricultural services
structure to more effectively utilize scarce university trained personnel.
4.          Proiect Obiectivest   The project aims to improve agricultural
productivity, farmer incomes and nutritional status through better and more cost
effective delivery of agricultural services on a national scale. Its immediate
objectives are to build on the Gitarama and other project experience to
a) strengthen adaptive and on-f arm research; b) improve the delivery of extension
services to farmers with a particular emphasis on reaching women farmers;
c) strengthen the production of selected seed; and d) promote greater private
sector participation In the marketing of agricultural inputs and produce.
5.          Proiect Description: The project would be implemented over a five
year period by MINAGRI and would comprise: a) reorganization and streamlining
of extension services in all or parts of five of Rwanda's ten prefectures
including implementation of a new structure integrating extension, adaptive
research, and monitoring and evaluation. The project would upgrade extension
staff through training and support improvements in extension methodology and
content; b) strengthening of adaptive and on-farm research through better
diagnosis of problem at the farm level, inclusion of farmers and local
authorities in problem identification and solving, and implementation of on-farm
and multilocal trials of new techniques and technologies provided by research;
c) support for monitoring and evaluation through the Implementation of a
decentralized management information system; d) strengthening of seed production
and distribution through support to the Selected Seed Service (SSS) to improve
seed quality control and certification, reactivation of the National Seeds
Committee for supervision of seed regulation, improved cost recovery for seed
production, and rationalization of production including improved management of
six seed farms developed under previous IDA supported rural development projects.
The project would support the development of a multi-purpose farm for seed
multiplication and adaptive research trials in Bugarama, Cyangugu prefecture
which would also serve as a base to encourage the contracting of small farmers
for seed multiplication; e) promotion of private sector participation in
agricultural input supply and marketing through assistance to cooperatives and
private enterprises to procure Inputs, obtain credit, and improve enterprise
management. NOOs and the Union of Cooperative Banks (Banques Populaires) would
be contracted to provide the needed services. Total project cost is estimated
at US$ 30.1 million with a foreign exchange component of US$ 11.2 million or 37
percent. Proposed IDA financing amounts to US$ 19.9 million (66 percent of
project costs). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and a disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Rwanda are given in Schedules C and
D respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7599-RW dated May 8, 1989 is
being distributed separately. A map is attached.
6.          Rationale for IDA Involvements   A primary objective of IDA's
agricultural strategy in Rwanda is the strengthening of national capabilities
in research, extension, policy formulation, planning and programming as a means
of improving agricultural performance. An additional aspect is the expansion
of markets through promotion of increased private sector activity. To this end,



- 3 -
IDA has recently finarced two operations in extension and research which address
key national issues of agricultural services--the National Research Project (Cr.
1546-RW) and the Gitarama project (Cr. 1669-RW).   Support for the proposed
project would be a continuation of IDA's strategy and of the assistance essential
for assuring productivity increases. IDA's involvement would also contribute
to donor coordination in eventually replacing a patchwork of donor supported
rural development and extension projects by a national approach to agricultural
services.
7.          Agreed Actions: During negotiations agreements were reached on the
following: a) evaluation of fertilizer pricing policy during the project midterm
review, to take place no later than November 30, 1992, to improve recovery of
fertilizer costs including retail margins; b) evaluation of the agricultural
services approach, also at the project mid-term review, and development of a
timetable for the integration of other donor-financed extension and rural
development projects into the agricultural services framework; c) no later than
January 1, 1993, GOR would shift the financing of its share of project operating
costs from the development to the recurrent budget where it would be identified
as a line item. Further, during the project midterm review GOR and IDA would
evaluate the Government's public expenditure program and budgetary procedures
for the agricultural sector to ensure their adequacy for continued funding of
the recurrent cost of the agricultural services; d) GOR would recover the full
direct costs of seed production by the end of project year 3 based on a Schedule
agreed with IDA; e) no later than June 30, 1990, MINAGRI will submit for IDA
review and comment draft technical criteria on seed production and certification
and, no later than January 31, 1991, issue a ministerial decision governing seed
production and certification which also empowers the SSS to effectively control
seed quality and certify seed; f) appointment of one project administrator and
one central level financial manager acceptable to IDA for the Agricultural
Services and Gitarama projects; g) maintenance at all times of a core staff (at
the minimum the project administrator and his staff) at the central level that
will provide support to the field services. Prior to credit effectiveness:
h) GOR would formally appoint the prefecture coordinators, appoint the project
administrator and recruit the financial manager and the adaptive research
officer; i) ISAR and the extension services (NINAGRI) would sign an accord with
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA detailing the respective duties of each
party with regard to adaptive research; J) GOR would open the counterpart fund
account in the National Bank of Rwanda and deposit an initial amount of RF 15
million corresponding to four months of its portion of expenditures (excluding
salaries and transport allowances) for the project.
8.          Benefits:   Project benefits are expected to be:   a) increased
productivity and output for an estimated 168,000 farm families and, as a result,
better nutrition and incomes. An additional 400,000 farm families will also
benefit from improved supervision and coordination of prefecture wide
agricultural activities by the prefecture teams to be financed under the project;
b) a strengthened field service expected to provide the framework for future
coordinated donor support to extension and adaptive research; c) savings of up
to US$ 3 million a year in the running costs of a more streamlined extension and
adaptive research service when this is eventually extended over the whole
country.   The project economic rate of return is based on an indicative
calculation of the order of magnitude of benefits needed to produce a 15 percent



ERR and the likelihood of attaining these benefits.  If the net incremental
benefits due to Improved agricultural services were to reach RF 1020 million (US$
13 million) per year by project year 1S I.e., 9 percent above the estimated
*\vithout projactI case, discounted economic benefits would equal discounted costs
and the ERR would be 15 percent. Conservative adoption rates of new cultivation
practices (an average 42 yearly) and rtdest pzoduction increases (1S annually)
would lead to a 15S ERR. Evidence from Bank-financed extension projects in other
sub-saharan Africa countries (e.g. Togo and Central African Republic) indicate
adoption rates for now extension themes of 10-50 among farmers sampled.
9.          Riskst   The main project risk is the limited availability of
university trained personnel to man the adaptive research service and the higher
echelons of the extension service.  To minimize this risk, a great deal of
emphasis will be placed on continuous on-the-job training to upgrado post
secondary staff and render them capable of performing specialized tasks. A
second risk is that donors may be slow or unwilling to work within the nw
framework thereby reducing expected savings from adoption of the structure
countrywide. MINAGRI is undertaking an effort to convince donors and this
appears to be yielding results. The ministry needs to be more specific however
on how each donor project should fit into the new system and the time frame for
doing this. The project midterm review will provide MNAGRI with the opportunity
to develop the required specificity on Implementation. Continued IDA dialogue
with donors on the proposed system is providing support to MIIAGRE and should
help minimize this risk.
10.         Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the project would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
