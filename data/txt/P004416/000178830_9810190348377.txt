SUM1ARY
i.        The Nat.ional Power Corporaition (NPC) has requested a loan of
US$12 mil.lion, including interest during construction, to finance a
part of the cost of a project consisting of a new 75 MW thermal plant on
Luzon and a 50 MW extension to an excisting hydro plant in Mindanao. The
cost of the project would be about US$22 million.  This would be the Bank's
fourth loan to NPC. Previous loans totalling US$58.7 million were made
in 1957, 1961 and. 1962.
ii.       The proposed thermal plant would be connected to the Luzon grid,
which consists of a svstem of high voltage transmission lines owned by NPC.
This grid links major market areas to generating sources owned by NPC,
which are all hvdro at nresent. and those owned by the Manila Electric:
Company (Meralco), which are predominantly thermal.  Meralco is a privately
owned uti.lity serving Manila and nearby areas. NPC is a government-owned
corporation with primary responsibil]ity for water power development through-
nuit the islnri.  NPr sells power in bulk to Mernlco and many smaller
utilities on Luzcn Island. In addition, a small but rapidly growing part
of its snles are made directlr to ind-ustryj part+ 'iclarly onn Mindanno Island
iii.      The tec.hnical aspects of t;he proJect should not prove a problem.
The work on Mindanao consists of a simple addition to an existing facility,

the general supervision of consultants.

needs stren.gtvhening. Cons'   + ~. ~..*0-,,44s w"b  to osutine  d he]p

by the end of 1967 and the new earnings level becomes effective in micd-1968.
The Government has undertaken to assist NrC in this matter.
vi.        in meeting its tariff conmmitments under the proposed loan agreement
NPC would contribute from internal cash generation, after covering debt serv-
ice, about 17 percent towards total construction expenditures for the four
fiscal years 1967 to 1970.  This low contribution from earnings is mainly
due to problems NPC is facing in fiscal years 1967 and 1968 as, pendcing the



- ii -
completion of the valuation study of NPC's fixed assets, tariffs would remain
unchanged dlring both years and the yield would be less than the required
8 percent; in addi-tion, debt service payments on loan 297-PH have to be
made even tlough the project is still under construction.   However, the
financing p:Lan for the next four fiscal years through 1970 can be considered
reasonably assured because the Government has agreed to give NPC financial
assistance to the extent required during 1967 and 1968. NPC also has size-
able cash balances available in addition to capital contributions recent:Ly
made by the NationaL Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) towards
the Angat nroiect.
vii.      The need for the proposed project has been established.   The
thermal plant on Luzon will be required to firm power supplies from hydro
plants so that NPC wiUl be able to serve expected new customers in t.he
provincial areas. The additional generating capacity on Mindanao is needed
to meet nnt:icippated indlus+rial v'qiiiromentc-. Tho motn. urgn  neeri for N1?r

including financial planning. The Bank has obtained specific commitments
in this direction:  first, that the Bank wIN-ll have the right to approve
the appointment of the General Manager;  and second, that management con-
s-a'l'an-tus sua:LtablUe to 'Ile Bank w-"L bue engagedu to recom,mend measures tLo
improve the operation and administration of the company.   The commitments
obtainled fromR IWO and the Goverrnmentu during negotiations should provide
the basis for mater:ial improvement in the management, operations, and
finances of NPC.
viii.     The project is suitable for a loan of US$12 million, for a
term of 20 years including about three and a half years of grace on
amortization payments.

of US$12 million to cover the foreign exchange costs of a 75 MW thermal
power station to be b-uilt on nataan peninlsula auross the bay f.om the
capital city of Manila and of a 50 MW extension (unit 4) to the existing
IvMaria Cristina hydro power station in itindanao. Tne total cost of the
two plant additions would be about US$22 million including interest
cnarged during the construction period..
2.        The proposed Bataan thermal power installation has been the
subject of many discussions within the Bank and between the Bank and NPC
during the past several years; an appraisal mission in 1964 consisting of
E. B. Arnold and H. C. Hittmair was followed by later visits to Manila, the
most recent, in January 1967 and discussions in Washington by NPC representa-
tives.
3.        1'he Bank has made three loans to NPC.  The first, of US$21
million in 1957, la-ter reduced to US$18.4 million (183-PH), was for the
Binga. hydrc,electric. project in northern Luzon.  The second, of US$34 million
in 1961 (297-PH), was for the Angat hydroelectric project near Manila, and
the third, of US$3.7 million in 1962 (325-PH), was for the expansion of the
Maria Cristina hydko station in Mindanao. The Binga project was completed
in 1960. Both the Angat and Maria Cr.istina projlects are still under corn-
struction.
4.        The LuzorL grid is a system of high voltage transmission lines.,
owned bv NPC. which connect the maior generating plants and market centers
of the north and central part of Luzon. The general features of the system
are shown on Man No= 1    Th, m vesytem œs minn-iRd by gpnpratinp n1ants owned
by NPC, which are presently all hydro, and by thermal plants owned by the
Manila Electric Company (Meralco)r the franchise holder in +he greater I.Manila

for long-ter-m-r capit;4l expn.sionr because of an      fv?nh -4nnd thl

II.  TIHE BORROWER
5.        NPC is a Government-owned corporation established by Commonwealth
Act No. 120 of 1936. Subsequent amendments to this Act fixed the corp,orate
life of NPC until December 31, 2000 and converted it into a stock corporaticn
with an authorized stock capital of Fz2O million wihich is fully issued.
6.        NPC1s Board of Directors, the National Power Board, is composed of
five members all appointed for a term of three years by the President of the
Philippirnes with the consent of the Commission on Appointments of the Congress
The members of thLe Board elect a chairman and a vice-chairman from among them-
selves.
7.        NPC is authorized to borrow up to P500 million with the recommenda-
tion of the Naticinal Economic Council and approval of the President of the
Philippines. Within the limits of this total borrowing power, NPC has been
authorized to borrow up to $100 million equivalent in foreign exchange, to be
guaranteed by the Government. NPC is exempt from all duties and taxes except
real property tax.
8.        The General 1Lnager is appointed by the Board with the approval of
the President of the Philippines. ?ast management has been generally weak in
utility planning and although a new General Manager was appointed late in
1966, it will take time to judge the results of this change. The General
Manager. althougl appointed by the Board, is "acting" until approval by the
President. The Board participates in the day-by-day management of the corpo-
ration muich more than it should and this will be one of the first problems for
the new acting manager. Another problem is a redundancy of staff, which shot'2'
be reduce(d or at least not further exypanded-
9.        The question of whether the proposed loan shohlld be e-onsdeired desp:L
these shortcomings of administration has been the subject of considerable dis-
eussi-on wi-thi-n t-he Pnksl aTlis dqiscussL-on l ed to the conclusion. t1hat on balaric
a loan was justified.  As regards the construction work, the present organi-
zation shoulld be capable r.f doing thiis partdici_ular1lyr in view of the fact that
for the thermal plant the consultants would have the responsibility for the
supeZris-ion of ctomstructit ne
10.       On the more fundamental problem of weaonesseS in admnistration
there are signs of improvement. As a condition of the proposed loan, NPC
have agreed to enggagre managwert consultanto, nrder terms of reference agreed
with the Bank, to recommend improvements in organization and to assist in
putting them ntV       c .L*.L Ts work w' cor.t;ue ar- earlier studyl-O.carr4ed
out during the first half of 1965 under the auspices of USAID. NPC also
agreed ICh-at @>e]'     Ldhaete ri-ght to approve 'Lhle appoitr.ent of the
General Manager in future. Moreover there are Pidicatlons thiat the present
PhL'Lppie a' ins'r ai.a seems de-L,<; to ,-pov      'h pe-4rmeo

serious in his willingness to accept the help of management consultants.

III. THE POWER I"ARKET
11.       The jurisdiction of NPC extends to all parts of the Republic.
Service is presently concentrated on Luzon and northern Mindanao islands,
with some generation provided in the other islands. The principal market
area is served by the Luzon grid. Next in size is the Agus River system
in northern Mindanao. The remaining smaller systems and isolated generating
stations are collectively referred to as the Small Plants.
Luzon Grid
12.       NPC's largest invPstments are in t1he Luzon grid which serves by
far the largest market in the Philippines. The installed generating capacity
of the grid was 811 MW as at the end of 1966 with an additional 383 MW under
construction. The ownership of these facilities was divided between NPC and
Meralco as follows:
NPCr    "ydroN                '207 T-T

Meralco (thermal)              165
383
13.       M4eralco clistributes electricity directly to consumers in the Manila
metropolitan area and transmits bulk power to a few local utilities for re-
sale.  The principal source of energy is from its thermal plants augmented
by substantial purchases of NPC hydroelectric energy. In addition to i'Js
large bulk power sales to Meralco, NPC sells at wholesale to many small
local util:ities, both private and municipal and also sells direct to some
industries outside of the Meralco area.
14.       In the past, N4eralco purchased about 136 SW and 600 million kwh
annually from NPC. A new contract, signed on May 1, 1966, and revised in
Novermber, provides for purchases of varying amounts of power and energy
during the five calendar years 1966-70 as follows:
:1966                129 MW and 486 Gwh
1967                 150 NW and 630 Gwh
:L968                196 NW and 885 Gwh
L969                 178 MW and 518 Gwh
1970                 132 MW and 390 Gwh



Meralco management would be wilLing to purchase up to 200 MFW but NPC is
unable to guarantee that amount and at the same time meet the expected
requirements of other customers. Elowever, the contract does provide for
considerable flexibility in the operations of both NPC and Meralco plants
to make best use of hydro generation and it is advantageous to both parties
as it provides for feedback by Meralco when NPC's reservoirs are low, thu.is
firming NPC's system as well as allowing Meralco to operate its steam plants
at higher Dlant factors.
l<.        NPC's non-Meralco market Is referred to as the "provincial" market.
In the past its requirements have been subordinated to serving the more im-
portant metronolitan Manila area market through Meralco and this has resulted
in a tendency on the part of industry to locate in the M7eralco service area
against the policy ovf the planning auithorities, who would like to have in-
dustrial development decentralized. NPC has therefore decided to give the
nronvinci1 mil i rnrl+.  mi,  ntnic firs+. rca  on nrdiuction faci-lities
16.        A relatively large program of tran.smission line construction
has been scheduled by NPC for the next; six years to expand the provincial
arket area. so that, by 1972, all partso o Tii.n wnulA hbe sernved by trans-

staff pardticipated in the fielu wuoK. Thu ±CiWIQ Was UdivludU int  six rUarket
areas (Nap No. 1) and detailed surveys were made of each area to determine the
characteristics of existing and potenilial customers, and the facilitles needed
to serve them. The survey resulted in a well-detailed tabulation of NPC's
present provincial market requirements, and the development of the market as
future transmission line extensions would be completed.
18.        The provincial market load growth estimate in Annex 1 indicates
that existing public utility and industrial loads are expectea to grow at
reasonable rates; however, the estimate has uncertainties: first, whether
new public utility loads will be connected as scheduled, and this depends
on the rate of transmission line construction; and second, whether new
industrial loads will materialize as forecast.   These uncertainties result
from Philippine experience which has showm that transmission line construction
can be unreasonably delayed by rights--of-way negotiations causing, in some
cases, losEs of potential customers as well as delays in reaching expected
revenue levels.  Financing of transmission line construction through Govern-
ment loans allocated from the proceeds of Japanese war reparations,
has aLso been cause for delay in the past but, as a condition of
the proposed loan, the Government has agreed to make every effort to expedite
its approval of NPC's applications for such funds. Wlith proper coordinatior
between NPC and other government entities, the line construction schedule
could be met.  NPC's industrial load growth estimate is based on actual in-
quiries for future service.  The prob:Lem arises in combining the inquiries
into a reasonable load forecast considering that potential customers are



generally optimistic on the timing as well as the requirements for service.
Agus Grid (Mindanao)
19.       The market served by the Agus grid is largely industrial.  It is
supplied by NPC's Maria Cristina hydrc plant which has presently two 25 MW
units in operation and a 50 MW unit un,der construction (Map No. 2). Important
customers include the Marcelo Fertilizer Company, the Iligan Integrated
Steel Mills Corporation, Maria Cristina Chemical Industries, the Mindanao
Portland Cement Company and the Central Philippines Milling Corporation.
Transmission lines are being extended to serve some nearby towns but load
growth can be expected primarily from additions to, or installations of,
industrial enterprises attracted to the area because of abundant and low
cost power. For example, an expansion to the integrated steel works now
under way will increase its annual power requirements from 8.5 NW and
1L.7 million kwh at nresent to 60 MW and 2L0 million kwh in fiscal year 1969
with a further increase to 160 MW and 960 million kwh scheduled by 1971.
20.       The power demand forecast and associated generating plant additions
needed to meet expnected load grnwth arp shown in Ann-x 2. Because the t;ime
required on. NPC's part to expand generation facilities is relatively short,
i+t is possible to defer capital in+vestiments in facilit-ies needed to serve
major customers until reasonably assured that a market for the increased
production will exist.

casts discussed later include the revenues and costs associated with this
aspec't of 'the business.
IV. SYSTEM PLANNING
22.       System planning to meet the requirements of the Luzon grid is
straightforward in concept as it is clear that the center of the load -wi.ll
remain in the Manila area for some years and, since most economic hydro
resources have already been developed, the bulk of future generating plant,
additions will be thermal of one type or another.  Therefore new plants shoucld
be located near Marila. -the difficul-ty in the past was due to lack of C:o-
ordinated planning by NPC and Meralco caused in large part by uncertainties
about the extension of Meralco's franchise. -With the franchise now extended,
Meralco has a sizeable construction program under way and plans to add
sufficient capacity to its system dur:Lng the next five or six years to
become less dependent on power purchases from NPC than it is at present..
While Meralco would probably be willing to add capacity above its own re-
quirements to become a supplier to NP(, the Government considers it would



- 6 -
be imprudent for NPC to rely on power purchases from Meralco. Therefore,
to provide the generating capacity necessary to meet its own market require-
ments, NPC intends to construct the Bataan thermal plant with an initial
unit of 75 Nw.
23.       Pcower and energy requirements of the total Luzon grid as well
as projected generating capability of both NPC and Meralco-owned plants are
tabulated in Annex 3 and shown graphically in Annex 4.
24.       The Electric Power Survey of the Philippines (paragraphlO) reported
that the long-range power requirements of the Luzon grid would require thie
installation of over 4,300 MW in new plant capacity between 1967 and 198L,
with corresponding investments of the order of US$00-US$450 million. The
problems of financing these large amounts will make joint investment
planning between NPC and Meralco increasingly necessary.
25.       System planning for the expansion of the Agus grid in Mindanao
is simple as the Amu-s River is canable of ultimate develonment to about
750 iMW in easily manageable and relatively inexpensive increments.  The
river. onnlv 36 kilomPeters long, connenot  TIke Lanan at el evation 700 meters

26.       The projects financed by the last two Bank loans are still under
construction although, according to original schedules, both should have been
cormpleted.  The reasonls for the delays have in both cases been due to poor
performance on the part of the contractors, the situation at the 218 MW Angat
hydro project having, been particularly bad.  The Angat contractor was a well-
established U.S. firm, whose bid was 23 percent below that of the second
bidder and almost 30 percent below the avierage of the second and third bidders.
Having underestimated the cost of the work, he performed badly and after
various inc.idents and legal actions, was released from the contract.   The
contractor who had originally been the second bidder was engaged in 1965 to
finish the wxork. Fthe second contractoris performance has not been as good
as expected due in part to poor job management by NPC. In late 1966 a serious
leakage problem developed in one of the Angat diversion tunnels; nowever,
it has been brought under control and the project is expected to be comp:Leted
in early 1968.
27.       The 50 1NW expansion of the Maria Cristina hydro station in Mindanao
is also beh:ind schedule but the problems have not been as serious as at Angat.



- 7 -
The delay is due mainly to the contractor's inexperience; NPC has helped the
contractor, who has had financial problems in addition to other difficulties,
and it appears that he will work his way out of his troubles and be able to
complete the project in 1967. Up to now, the delay has not had serious conse-
quences on operation since the market for the plant's expanded output did
not materialize as scheduled. Thus no revenues have been lost.
VI. THE PROJECT
28.       The Project would comprise the construction, on Luzon Island, of
the 75 rMW Bataan thermal plant and the installation, on I4indanao Island, of
the fourth unit of 50 SW capacity in the Maria Cristina hydroelectric power
station (Agus 6) together with permanent control works on the Agus River.
General features of the project are as follows:-
Bataan Thermal Plant, Luzon Island
29.       The first unit would be rated at 75 MIW and the plant would be
laid out. f  fr Ninire e.pansion. =Si tf foindation conditions are satisfactorv.
Adequate condenser circulating water supply would be available from Manila
Pav enni amnle quantities of fresh water wou7ld be obtainable from wells.
30.       1nor-m-  r oriler firing would use high viscosity fuel supplied from
the adjacent Esso oil refinery.  NPC and Esso have agreed on a long-term fuel
^on+ract ~an Tsso o-'1A buil-d ard mairtain +he oE ppein     from +)-reInrJ
to the thermal plant metering tanks.  The contract would be based on the cost
ofP +%el Aelivre -- o the boiler t! arn asA--4go-- feaur     forNPC.  The  erm

of the proposed contract have been reviewed and found satisfactory.
31.       Emergency fuel storage tanks of a capacity to ensure a 2h-hour supply
of fuel would be provided to allow for interruptions to -tne normal supply.
Should it be necessary to obtain fuel supplies from sources other than the
Esso refinery, space has been provided in the site layout for tne installation
of bulk fuel oil storage facilities and an adequate deep water anchorage, for
berthing oil tankers, is available adjacent to the site.
32.       The plant layout and cost estimates were prepared by NPC's ccn-
sultants, Electroconsult of Milan, Italy.  This firm would be retained to
prepare the initial design, preparation of specifications, bid evaluation,
and supervision of construction. The staff of NPC would assist in all these
functions, but primary responsibility would rest with the consultant, a.s
would the responsibility for initial commissioning of the plant and training
of NPC operating personnel.
33.       About 25 MW of the plant oLutput would be delivered directly to an
Esso fertilizer plant about two kilorneters away and the balance would be
supplied to the Luzon grid via an existing 230 kv transmission line.
34.       The cost, estimate has been based on international prices for im-
ported equipment and Philippine prices for civil works.   The estimated cost
of the plant before contingencies would be about US$15h/kw. The civil works



estimate should prove adequate since the site conditions are good and the
type of construction quite conventional. Contingency provisions of about
11 percent on civil works, equipment and its erection, have been inciuded
in the cost estimate and should prove! adequate. All equipment would be
procured on the basis of international competitive bid-ding. The plant is
scheduled to be in operation in mid-1.970 which should provide sufficient
time for construction.  The estimatect costs of this section of the Project
are summarized in the table in paragraph 39.
Maria Cristina Hydroelectric Plant, Mindanao Island
35.       The Project would include a further extension of the Maria Cristina
hydroelectric power station, present:ty being extended with the aid of Loan
325-PH, by the installation of a fourth unit of 50 NW to increase the station
capacity to 150 MW and also the construction of control works on the Agus
River, at the outfall of Lake Lanao.
36.       The control works would comprise the construction of permanent
regulating structulres and dredging of an approach channel at the lake out-
let to the Agus River. Lake Lanao prov:Ldes a large natural reservoir with
an area of 350 km2? draining a catchment area of some 2100 km2. Regula-ting
the outfall of the Lake will enable 750 MW to be developed, in seven s-tages,
by utilizing the gross head of 700 meters available over the 36 km course
of the Agus River.
37.       The addLtion of the fourth unit of 50 1MW to the Maria Cristina
power station wou:ld involve very little additional civil works at the power
plant since the intake structure for the fourth and fifth units and exten-
sions of the foundations are now being constructed as part of work financed
bv the previous Bank Loan 325-PH.
38.       Maior equinment awards have been made followine international
competitive bidding but no payments to suppliers had been required up to
the end of 1966 and reimhurspmpnt of any amounts NPG might hb requiired to
make before signing of the proposed loan is not contemplated. Adequate
contingencv allowances of 20 nercent on civil works and 11 nercent on plant
and equipment have been included in the estimated costs. The work would
continue construction now in nrogrens and is nlanned for comnletion in 1968
which is reasonable. Cost estimates for the work are included in the table

VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
40.        NPC's tariffs are subject to review by the Office of Economic
Coordination, the agency responsible for the supervision of Government-owned
corporations. Final approval for any tariff alteration must be obtained frorw
the Cabinet.. In the past, this procedure has subordinated NPC's tariff
actions to political considerations, and has led to considerable delays in
adiustments.
111.       Murthermore. NPC has exnerienced great difficulties in placingz
approved tariff increases into effect. A main obstacle was the contractuial
arrangement between NPC and Meralco.   rn 1962 NPC was authorized to increase
tariffs by an average of about 17.5 percent. Meralco refused to accept this
inGreane under fh. term.s of the then-enstinng supply eont.rac-t, whereupon NPG
gave notice of contract cancellation, which took effect in 1965. After an
inte-Lm ageemer.  ar.ewcontac wras fin.nlly cianr.e in May- 1946 (pnragrnnh 14)i
which now covers the period through 1970 with options for renewal.   The tenris
of +he contract reslt in a. increase in. the average price of energr of L9.6



- 10
percent during the next four years, as conpared to the old contract.    while
the terms and conditions of the new contract are equitable, the increase in
tariffs, while slightly higher than that originally approved, will not oiffset
the loss in revenues caused by their delayed application.    Some of NPC's
customers in the provinces fought the tariff increase of 1962 through court
injunctions., but these were partially countered by NPC and the new tariffs
have been put into effect for the majority of the provincial customers.    In
addition, all new contracts have been made at the higher tariff,    While there
is still litigation pending before the Supreme Court about the legality of
the 1962 increase, the results, even if adverse to NPC, are not expected to
materially affect NPC's ability to carry out the project.
42.       The previous Loan 325-PH (November 7, 1962) to NPC contained a
covenant which requ:Lred that tariffs be set at a level to produce revenues
sufficient to cover operating costs and debt service, and to finance a
reasonable portion of future expansion.   The Guarantor undertook to assist
NPC in meeting this commitment.    A reasonable portion for the period fiscal
years 1963 -to 1965 iras aereed to be 25 percent of construction expenditu;res,
and a higher percentage thereafter.   NPC was not able to meet these require-
ments and contribut,ed only about 17 nercent for this three-year period,
in spite of the fact that capital expenditures were much lower than estimated.
Prospects for the immediate future are not imoroved (paragraph 51).    NPC's
contribution towards expansion during the construction period of the pro-
posed Projiet (196%7 through 1969) is rinot likelyto  e more than about 17 Der-
cent.   As explained in paragraph 53, there are specific reasons why the pro-
nposed finanning plan is considered ac-reptahleP despite this low contribution.
The importance of maintaining a minimum level of earnings has however led
to a change in the tariff covenant for the proposed loan.

initial valuation of NPCs fixed assets in operation for tariff-setting pur-
poses will be included in the terms of reference of the management consultants
(paragraph 10).
Present Fi.nancial Position
44.       Condensed balance sheets for fiscal years 1964 to 1966 are shown
in Annex 5.   NPC's accounts which are kept in accordance with accepted busi-
ness principles and practices, are reviewed annually by auditors appointed by,
and responsible to, the Auditor General of the Philippines.    A review of the
internal as well as external auditing procedures will be included in the
management study.

P510 million; deduicting the depreciation reserve of about P32 million;
net fixLed assets were P478 million.  These assets are shown at origina:L
cost and their value is unquestionably understated because two of NPC's
major nydro plants, Amnbuklao and Binga, were builT before the devaluation
of the peso (P2 to Pi4 = us$1) in 1961.  In order to establish the
current value of NPC!s net fixed assets in operation it was agreed to
have the management consultants make a fiull valuation study which
would then be reviewed by the Bank and would form the basis for NPC's
tariff commitments..  For purposes of the forecasts in this report a
partial revaluation was made, the specific assumptions for which are
stated in the notes to Annex 5.

The original amounts of these foreign currency loans were:
(a) US$20 million from the Export-Import Bank for the
Aimbuklao project;
(b)  US$21 mi:Llion, later reduced to USu18.4 million
from the Bank for the Binga project;
(c) US$34 mi:Llion from the Bank for the Angat project;
(d) US$3.7 million also from the Bank for the Maria
Cristina expansion; and
(e)  P7.9 mil:lion equivalent in material financed
through the Government from proceeds of Japanese
war reparations.
Each loan is stateid in NPC's balance sheet in its peso equivalent at
the exchange rate in force at the time of drawdown. Up to August
1965, NPC had paid the free market rate of about Pa = US$1 for servicing
all foreign exchange debts, and had annually written off the resulting
foreign exchange losses.  In August 1965 the Central Bank announced
that certain debts incurred prior to decontrol in 1961 could be serviced
at a preferential rate of P3.20 - US$a, and debt service payments made
in the past in excess of this rate would be reimbursed. The Eximbank
loan and Bank loans 183-PH and 297-PH are debts which qualify under
this rulina and to date P4.23 million have been reimbursed. More
recently, however, a legal problem has been raised whether the Government
can commit itself to this preferential rate for the full repayment period
of the loans and the Central Bank is reviewing this question. Meantime, a
written assurance has been obtained by NPC that the Government will
provide ccmpensating financial assistance to NPC if the preferential
rate shonl be hp diiscontinud in +.he fvitmre.  The forecasts therefore
assume debt service payments for these three loans at the rate of

Earnings Record
49.       Summarized income statements for the fiscal years 1964 to 1966
are shown in Annex 6.   The rate of re-turn on average net fixed assets was
6.7 percent in 196l4 and increased to 3.7 percent in 1965 due to the appJica-
tion of higher tariffs to some of NPC's customers.   These return figures
are overstated to the extent that NPC's fixed assets are valued at historic
cost. The results would be lower after a proper and full valuation of NPC's
plant; as mentioned in paragraph 45; satisfactory arrangements for such an
asset; revaluation have been agreed upon during negotiations.  The under
valuation of fixed assets also affects the level of depreciation provisions
and, with a given rate of return therefore, NPC's internal cash generation.
During the four year period ending Junae 30, 1966 the net cash contributiLons
from earniLngs (after meeting debt service) financed only about 15.3 percent
of capital expenditures, even though the expansion program progress was much
slower than previously expected. This low contribution was mainly due to
the general level of tariffs, the delays in the approval of higher tariffs,
the difficulties encountered in their application, and the reduced level
of revenues because of the delay in the completion of Angat. On the other
side however, debt service requirements were high because the preferent.ial
exchange rate for servicing some of NPC's foreign debt was not yet applied
and because regular debt service payments on loan 297-PH (Angat) commenced
from June :L965 without the benefit of revenues from this project.

Proposed Financinz Plan

contributing a total of P21.50 million towards the Angat

51.        During the four year period, to June 30, 1970 total con-
struction expenditures would amount to P298 million of which the proposed
project would represent about 27 percent, the completion of plants under
construction about 19 percent and new additions of generating plant and.

service about' P   I.UA.±±LI or 17 percent; jP23  mi'ion or about 8U percent,
would come from borrcowings, and about PLO million or about 3 percent from
otuer capital. receipts.
52.       The borrowings assumed for the period of the forecasts through
fiscal year 1972, aside from the drawdown of outstanding balances from
IBRD loans 29 7-itH and 325-PH are as follows:
(a) A 3ank loan of US$12 million, including interest during
construction, early in 1967 covering the foreign exchange
cost of the Bataan thermal plant, the fourth Maria Cristina
unit and control works at Lake Lanao, at an assumed interest
rate of 6 percent and for a term of 20 years including a
grace period of about three and a half years.
(b)  A series oi 10-year Government; loans totalling some
P72 million would be obtained from Japanese war reparation
funds for the construction of the Luzon transmission
system at an interest rate of 3 percent; after a 10 percent
down payment in the first year, the remainder of the loans
would be payable over a 9-year period in level payments of
interest arid amortization.   Because of delays experienced
by NPC in the past in securing this type of loan, the
Government agreed during negotiations to expedite the
processing of NPC's future reparation agreements.
(c)  A future foreign exchange loan for a total of about
US$11 million would be obtainesd for the financing of the
foreign exchange requirements of NPC's next future generation
ex)ansion, the fifth Maria Cristina unit and Agus 2 in
Mindanao, to be started in fiscal year 1968; a further
foreign exchange loan of US$9 million in mid-1969 would
finance the second stage of thae Bataan thermal plant.   The
terms assurmed are the same as those of the proposed Bank loan.
(d') Local currency bond issues at 6 percent. totalling P55 million.
are assumed for the three fiscal years 1967, 1968 and 1969.
The bond issues would initially be made for 10-year neriods
renewable at the end of the tenth and twentieth year, in
accordanne with an undertnking given by the Government to
NPC; these renewals are necessary because the sinking fund
provisio.ns are to be comnpruted on a 3.5 percen.t 30-year basis.
Debt service on foreign exchange loans is presented at the rate of
P4 = US$1, except for the Eximbank loan, and previous Bank Loans 183-PH

53.       ThiLs financing plan shows that M:?C will face a difficult period for
the present and the coming fscal years, 1'367 and 1968, when it has to reLy
heavily on sources other than its own earnings to finance its expansion.

Since problems in the construction of the Angat project might cause an increase
in construct-Lon cost which cannot be auantified at this moment,.it was decided
to leave year end cash balances at a level which would allow a further drawn-
down to cover such increases. On the assuinption that NPC will meet its tariff
commitments in 1969, the picture improves considerably thereafter. If the
Capitalizat.ion Act were amended as prnposed (paragranh )i6) de.ht service in
1971 and 197:2 would be reduced by a total of about P23 million and the fi-
nanciinop pic+ure wnilii fuirther improve. -lf%e f;rnancingp plan fror the nmv-t yearsc

and 1968 to the extent required (presumably by placing
NPC bond isuues).
Estimated Future Financial Position
54.       Forecast income statements for the six years ending June 30, 1972
are given in Annex 6.  Forecast cash flow statements for the same period are
shown in Annex 7 and. the resulting balance sheets in Annex 5._/ Operatin.g
income would increase from P21.9 million in 1967 to P60.3 million in 1972,
due ma.inly to the growth of the markets in the Agus grid area and provincial
Luzon. NPC would have to raise tariffs in 1969 in order to reach and maintain
an 8 percent rate of return on its average net fixed assets in operation.
On the basis of present forecasts, this increase in average revenues per kwh
would have to be abcut 12 percent to achieve the agreed rate of return. The
tariff increase will be required because of the expected increase in NPC's
rate base after its fixed assets have been properly valued;   it will also
partly be needed because of the initia:Lly lower return on the sizeable invest-
ment in rural transmission facilities and the fact that the investment irn the
proposed thermal station, while needed to firm NPC's hydro system, will riot
be fully utilized inmediately.
55.      Internal cash generation wou'Ld increase from P27.7 million in
1967 to P79.3 million in 1972. Total debt service would only be covered
1.0 and 1.2 times in 1967 and 1968 due to the low earnings level and
in 1967 because of debt service payments on the Angat loan (297-PH)
prior to the completion of the Angat project.  NPC's available cash balances
and the Government' s specific commitment to support NPC financially in these
two years should be an adequate assurance for NPC's continued solvency and
for an orderly progress of its expansion program. After the tariff increase
in 1969 debt service coverage would be 1.6 and 1.5 times in 1969 and 1970 and
would then dron to 1 .2 and 1  times in the subsenuent years when nart of NPC's
1/  Except as otherwise stated the year quoted in the subsequent paragra:phs
always refers to tne fiscal year ending June 30 of the specific year.

equity has to be redeemed;   if the amendment of NPC's Capitalization Act
is passed prior to 1971 and its payment provision repealed, the debt
service coverages would be 1.5 and 1.6 times respectively.    As discussed
in paragraph 51, internal cash generation net of debt service would
contribute about 17 percent towards c:onstruction expenditures during
the four years 1967 to 1970.    For the two years 1971 and 1972 the
contribution percentage would be 37 percent.    With the qualifications
and explanations aiven, these ratios andc percentages are acceptable.
56.       During rieeotiations, it was agreed; as in the previous loans,.
that a debt limitation covenant would be included in the proposed loan
agreement relating the incurrence of new debt to NP(.-, ahility to cover
maximum-ffuture service on its long-term debt with a margin.    The
Covenant, as used in Loan Agreement 35-PHj leaves NPC the c-hoice off
covering rmaximum annual future debt service either (a) at least 1.3
times from historic, 12-mnnths' net revenues or (b) at least 1.5 times
from historic, 12--monthst net revenues plus 75 percent of the estimate(d
increaseo in net ravoni  fro,m .all of NTPf'I pnnTer opera+.4ns for t+he fir5

VIII.   CCNCLUSIONS
57.       NPC management needs to be strengthened.    With the planned
entry into the ther mal field, the growth of tra-an'uiuii by"tees,  th
increasing number of customers, etc., the top executives will need a
better understanding of utility operations and planning tihan they have
had in the past.    The agreement by NPC to employ management consultants,
should prove helpful.
58,.      NPCIs tariff setting procedures and its ability to put new
tariffs into effect when approved have been influenced to a great extent
in the past by political considerations, but the Government has undertaken
to grant, or cause to be granted, tariffs to NPC which will achieve an,
annual 8 percent return on its net fixed assets at current value.
59.       The proposed project consisting of the new Bataan thermal
plant on Luzon and an expansion of an existing hydro plant in Mindanao is
technically sound and no particular problems should be experienced in its
execution.   The Bataan plant is needed to firm NPC's hydro sources during
low water periods so that NPC can expand its service area and enter into
firm power contracts with its customers.    The expansion of the Maria
Cristina hydro plant in Mindanao is needed to supply the requirements of
the growing industrial market in the area.
60.       NPC's present financial position is acceptable although capital
expenditures and debt service payments would place a considerable burden
on NPC's cash resources during the coming years.    The present fiscal year



- 18 -
1967 and fiscal yesar 1968 will in addition be difficult for NPC due to the
delay in the comp:Letion of the Angat project.   The Governmentts assurance
of financial assistance to NPC for this period and NPC's cash resources
accumulated in past years should be an adequate safeguard that NPC wil:L
overcome this difficult period.   B  fiscal year 1969 NPC is committed
to establish and maintain tariffs which would at least yield an 8 percent
retiirn on properly valued fixed assets which would result in a satis-
factory financing picture.   The financing plan for NPC's expansion
over the next, four years including the proposed project would be
acceptable on this basis.
61.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12 million
equivalent, including interest during construction, for a term of about
20 years, including about three and a half years period of grace.

NOTES TO BALANCE SHEET
1.        The condensed Balance Sheet 1966 (Amended) shows:
(a)  The increase in value of fixed assets in operation referred
to in paragraph 45 i.e. to the extent of the outstanding
foreign ePwhnnge Inans that. wPre used to finance them.    The
projects affected were Ambuklao (Eximbank loan) and
Ringa (:83-PH)-  npnreniation hAs nlso been revalued
proportionally.    The revaluation of net assets is thus
only a partial rev2lu2tion pending the outnome of the study
to be made by NPC1s management consultants.
(b)  Work in progress is left unchanged because expenditures on
the Angnt prn -iit-+. finanncedA hby loa. 9Q7-PH were alrpead stated
at the rate of Pr4 = US$1.
(c)  Current and other assets are shown net of current and
other 1J&liDablIities.e

2.        The NAWASA contributions represents the portion of the investment
in the angat Project which is being conLtributed 'uy the National Water>- rks
and Sewerage Authority.    The contribution is in recognition of the
benefits that the project will achieve for the domestic water supply of
Manila.   The contribution is not reimbursable by NPC and is excluded from
the average net fixed assets on which the rate of return is calculated.
It is also excluded from equity in calculating the debt equity ratio.

Income deductions. Flor purposes of calculating the rate of return the amount has been deducted from. operating irncome before expressing it as a ratio of                   i
average niet fixced assets irn operation. The problem disappears in 1967 and the following years due to the r-evaluattion of fixed assets and foreign
exchange debt.
2/ Other Income in 1963-1966 includes mainly a) interest earned on time c[eposits, b) instalments due on the sale of fertilizer plant, and c) interest from
Singking ]-'und Investments. For the forecasts interest earnied on sinkirng fund investments is shown as credit to irncome deductions and the fertilizer
plant receipts in the cash flow; no other interest earnings are assumed since NPC has liquidated its time deposits.
3/ For ourposes of calculating the rate of return the value of assets has been reduiced appropriately by the equivalent of' Ps.21.50 million contributed by
NAlNASA towards the Arngat pioject.
