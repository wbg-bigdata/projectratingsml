MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.             This report appraises the proposed expansion of the Government-
owned Natural Gas Fertilizer Factory (NGFF) operated by the National Fertilizer
Corporation (NFC) at Multan in the Province of the Punjab.  NGFF has produced
urea and ammonium nitrate limestone since 1962 from natural gas from the Sui
gas field.  To cater to the growing fertilizer requirements of the country,
NFC will buiild a large new ammonia plant with a daily capacity of 910 tons
-- thereby allowing it to shut down the existing small and obsolete ammonia
units. The ammonia will feed the existing fertilizer plants as well as new
fertilizer units which are to produce high water soluble nitrophosphate (1,020
tons/day) and calcium ammonium nitrate (1,500 tons/day). A new company,
Pakarab Fertilizer Ltd. (PFL) to be owned 70% by NFC and 30% by the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Corporation (ADNOC), has been formed and will be the Borrower.
The expansion, which will also be based on Sui gas and which will increase
Pakistan's annual fertilizer production by about 200,000 tons of nitrogen
(N) and 70,000 tons of phosphate in terms of P20 , is expected to cost PRs
928 million (US$94 million). Engineering work started in February 1974 and
the project is to be completed by the end of 1976.
ii.            The Bank's only direct financing of industry in Pakistan to date
has consisted of a US$32 million loan in 1968 (together with an IFC investment
of US$2.9 million) for the Dawood Hercules Chemicals (DH) ammonia/urea
fertilizer project, also located in the Punjab near Lahore. Construction
was completed on schedule in July 1971 and was achieved with only a minor
cost overrun, primarily due to increases in customs duties. DH has rapidly
attained and been able to sustain over 100% rated capacity production. In
appraising the DH project, the Bank pointed out the critical importance of
balancing nitrogen with phosphatic fertilizers. The Multan project will help
to achieve this aim.  No additional fertilizer plants have be en built in
Pakistan recently but other projects are now being planned, one of which -
an ammonia/urea plant sponsored by the Pauji Foundation of Pakistan - IFC has
been asked to assist.
iii.           Fertilizer consumption has increased rapidly in Pakistan since the
early 1960's. Sales of nitrogenous fertilizers went up from 41,000 nutrient
tons in 1962/63 to about 400,000 tons in 1972/73, somewhat above the projec-
tions made in the DH appraisal report. The rapid growth in fertilizer con-
sumption has been due largely to the greater awareness of the benefits of
fertilizers among the farmers and to the Government's effort to increase its
availability.  With regard to future use of fertilizers, it is estimated that
by about 1980 demand will reach some 875,000 nutrient tons for nitrogenous
and 220,000 nutrient tons for phosphatic fertilizers. Pakistan's production
including the expanded Multan plant and the Fauji project, is expected to
amount to about 700,000 nutrient tons of N and 80,000 nutrient tons of P 0
The project therefore is particularly urgent. Since nitrophosphate fertilizers



- ii -
arec -r-elatively new to the farmers in Pakistan, the Government has agreed to
import such fertilizers for promotional purposes prior to the completion of
the project.
iv.       The Gcvernment of Pakistan has asked IBRD and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) for loans of US$35 and 27 million equivalent respectively; the
US$40 million balance of the US$102 million financing required will be covered
b,7 equity from NFC and ADNOC and local loans.  The proposed Bank loan will
f3nviace the cost of equipment and spares for the amonia plant and utilities,
r-he f_i> fer related engineerirg and the technical advisor.  The loan will be
for 15 years, including four years of grace, with an effective interest rate
to PFL of 9-1/2% per annum, including a guarantee fee accruing to the Govern-
ment. The Bank loan will meet about 40% of the cost of the project or about
50% of its foreign exchange needs. The balance of the foreign exchange expen-
ditures will be covered by the ADB loan to be used primarily for the nitric
acid and nitrophosphate plants, and by a portion of the equity, which is also
to finance local expenditures. No cash generation from the existing plant
has been assumed in the financing plan. Although not many local suppliers
are expected to qualify for the type of equipment to be financed by the Bank,
they will be allowed a preference of 15% or the customs duties for a non-exempt
importer whichever is lower.
v.        The objectives of the project are:  (1) to provide an economic-sized
plant (based on modern proven technology new to Pakistan) to help meet the
country's phosphate needs, now met mostly by limited imports; (2) to avoid
foreign exchange expenditures for imported sulfur by using nitric acid made
from Pakistan natural gas instead of sulfuric acid; and (3) to supply nitrogen
to reduce the dependence on expensive, often hard to obtain, imports. The
project is not designed to meet all of Pakistan's nitrogen and phosphate
needs as other urea plants and an additional phosphate plant are planned to
complement the expanded Multan production at appropriate future intervals.
vi.       The project is designed to assist Pakistan to utilize more fully
at an economic cost its agricultural potential particularly in the Punjab, its
most fertile agricultural area. Pakistan's agronomic potential for fertilizer
usage would be greater than assumed in this report were it not for constraints
such as credit, water, seeds, pesticides, and shortage of foreign exchange
for imports. As in the past, insufficient production in the short run will
continue to be the most serious handicap to more rapid increases in Pakistan's
agricultural output.
vii.      The project has been developed with the assistance of a competent
Pakistani firm of chemical consultants. The project's Managing Director and
General Manager (Project) have been appointed. The Bank has emphasized the
importance of forging a strong and effective team to carry out the project
and has stressed the need for an experienced industrial management to this
end. PFL has appointed a qualified firm with nitrophosphate experience as
"owner's representative"i or technical advisor to assist the project's manage-
ment during construction and uatil all units can be run on a sustained basis



- iii -
of at least 90% of capacity without further outside assistance. The exist-
ing plant currently employs a total of 1,700 workers including 42 technical
and 20 non-technical supervisors. Due to a substantial excess of labor at
the plant at present, no additional workers will be required for the expanded
plant.
viii.     The project's capitalization, based on about 64/36 debt/equity
financing provides a sound basis. As the loans are repaid and reserves
built up out of earnings, the company's financial position will further
improve and further expansion should be possible. A satisfactory return on
the equity is sought by the Government as well as the shareholders to attract
additional capital to the fertilizer industry. To ensure PFL's financial
viability, the Bank obtained agreement that the Government will not set: ferti-
lizer prices at a level which would prevent PFL from reaching the earnings
target set by its shareholders, i.e., a 15% return on equity. Projected
cash generation for long-term debt service coverage is adequate. The finan-
cial return, using an increased gas cost to take into account the return
required by the gas supply company (Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd.), is
estimated to be 23% before tax and 17% after tax. Even under adverse condi-
tions, the financial return is not expected to drop below 10%.
ix.       The project's estimated economic return is 34%, reflecting the
competitive advantage of local production from indigenous gas compared to
long-term import prices (assumed in the report to be about 50% of current
high world market prices). Based on foreseeable adverse factors such as
increased gas, phosphate rock and bag costs not fully offset by higher
prices, and a maximum production of 80% of capacity, the economic return
would still be above 20%. Annual net foreign exchange savings ascribed to
the project at 90% capacity are estimated to be US$50 million.
x.        Based on agreements reached as summarized at the end of the report,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35 million equivalent.






I. INTRODUCTION
A.   General
1.01      The Government of Pakistan has requested a Bank loan of US$35
million equivalent for a project which is expected to cost US$94 million
equivalent and which is to increase more than five-fold the capacity of the
rather small and partly outdated Multan nitrogenous fertilizer unit of the
Government-owned National Fertilizer Corporation (NFC). The Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) has agreed to lend US$27 million for the project and the
balance will be financed with equity and rupee loans on terms satisfactory
to the Bank. The proposed Bank loan would be made to Pakarab Fertilizers
Limited (PFL), a newly formed company owned by NFC (70%) and the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Corporation (ADNOC) (30%) and would be guaranteed by Pakistan
and NFC. The project, based on indigenous natural gas and imported phosphate
rock would increase capacity by 306,000 tons per year (tpy) of nitrophosphate 1/
(NP) and 450,000 tpy of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) 2/ and provide 57,000
tpy of ammonia for the existing plant.   Upon completion of the project the
Multan fertilizer unit would have a total capacity of about 240,000 tpy of
nitrogen (N) and 70,000 tpy of phosphate (P205). Detailed engineering
commenced in February 1974 and commercial production is scheduled to start
by January 1977.
1.02      Multan, located in the center of the Punjab province, Pakistan's
prime agricultural area (IBRD MaplO818), is one of three NFC fertilizer units.
The plant began production in 1962 and has never operated at full capacity
due to technical difficulties in the ammonia section. However, despite
these difficulties and the sub-economic size of most plant units, the factory
has shown a profit in most years by virtue of subsidies paid by the provincial
and central governments.
1.03      The project was first reviewed by the Bank in mid-1972 and alter-
native projects (Annex 1-2) were evaluated by local consultants (Chemical
Consultants Pakistan, Ltd.) in early 1973 at the Bank's request. The proj-
ect of the scope and size now proposed resulted from these comparative
studies.
1.04      The appraisal was carried out in Pakistan in September/October 1973
by Messrs. Perram (Chief), Pratt and Shen of the Industrial Project Department
concurrently with an ADB appraisal mission.
B. Bank Group Involvement in the Pakistan Fertilizer Sector
1.05      The proposed loan would be the Bank's second for a fertilizer project
in Pakistan; the first loan of US$32 million equivalent together with an IFC
equity investment of US$2.9 million was made in July 1968 to Dawood Hercules

5he :llS6 11 (D) for their 620/1,100 tpd ammonia/urea plant (Report AA-4a dated
June 2C  8.6`).  D. began production in July 1971 virtually on schedule and
within the original foreign exchange budget. The plant reached rated capacity
in record time and has been operating above capacity on a sustained basis.
Local ca?itai costs were higher than estimated due primarily to increases in
custom duties. Currency revaluations also increased the amount of the dollar
equivaient of 4he Bank loan disbursemenlts to over US$35 million equivalent
res:lting in a total cost of US$84.6 million versus the original US$78.2
million estimate. Annex 1-3 describes the DH results to date.
1.06      At the time of the DH loan the Bank was considering a second similar
fertilizer project to meet Pakistan's growing nitrogen needs. Due to a
variety of factors including failure of the local and foreign partners to
reach sntisfactory agreements between themselves and the Government, the
Govrernment sanction expired. Since then no major fertilizer project has
boen implemented in Pakistan except DH.  IFC is now considering another
ammonia/urea project sponsored by Pakistan's Fauji Foundation and the Bank
may also be asked to participate in the financing (Annex 1-4).
II. THE COMPANY
A. Background and Ownership
2.01      The project will be carried out by PFL, which has an authorized
capital of PRs 1,000 million (US$101 million). The 70% owner, NFC, is a
government agency whose primary purpose is to operate and promote fertilizer
production in the public sector. It succeeded the West Pakistan Industrial
Development Corporation (WPIDC) vhich grew into a large complex organization,
having until recently operational responsibility for most of the 59 projects
it Promoted; it is now gradually divesting itself of these operational respon-
sibilities in line with a reorganization announced in August 1973 and intends
increasingly to play the role of a development corporation. WPIDC has not
received any financing from the Bank. During construction of the project,
NFC will exercise control over PFL through its majority on the PPL Board but
it is anticipated that once PFL is operational the relationship will become
that of a holding company to one of its investments. NFC has agreed to guar-
antee the proposed Bank loan and not to dispose of any of its shares in PPL
without Bank approval. In March 1973, ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi Government's
national oil corporation, agreed to acquire 30% of the equity of the new ferti-
lizer company. ADNOC's interest in investing in a fertilizer plant in Pakistan
is in accordance with an agreed plan of mutual cooperation between Pakistan
and Abu Dhabi in certain ventures, including joint investments in industry,
particularly oil refineries. ADNOC's role as a minority shareholder is clearly
one of an investor; the promotion, financing, organization and implementation
of the project is being left to NFC. Annex 2-1 describes the sponsors, the
initial Board, the senior officers and   L a organization chart.



-3-
B. Existing Facilities
2.02      These comprise two 100 tpd ammonia plants plus downstream units
for making 180 tpd crystalline urea, 200 tpd nitric acid (100% basis) and
300 tpd ammonium nitrate-limestone (ANL-26% N). Offsites include boilers,
water treatment and cooling, storage buildings, offices and a housing colony.
The ammonia plants have never averaged more than about 80% of their capacity
on a sustained basis and require excessive maintenance. Conversely, the
downstream units have worked well and can achieve 120% of design capacity,
given sufficient ammonia. Consequently, as is described in more detail in
connection with the discussion of the project in Chapter IV, it is intended
to shut down the ammonia plants. PFL will keep the downstream units in opera-
tion to produce, after some modification, prilled urea (46% N) and CAN (26%
N). Economically produced ammonia from the project and the virtual elimina-
tion of depreciation and financial charges on the existing plants is expect-
ed to result in economic operation, even though the capacities are small and
the units are old.
C. Organization and Management
2.03      NFC has the right to appoint 8 and ADNOC 4 directors.  PFL's
initial Board was designated in November 1973. The full Board is being
constituted. NFC has elected its Chairman Mr. Baber Ali as PFL's Chairman
and appointed a Managing Director who will have day to day responsibility
for the Company's operations. The Chairman is well known to the Bank Group
and is considered to be an outstanding industrial executive with a successful
record in private industry. The Managing Director, Mr. Amman Ullah Loan, is
the former Technical Manager of Stii Northern Gas Pipelines, Limited. He is
an engineer, well-known to Bank staff. He will coordinate the work of the
Technical Advisor, the engineering firms and the local Chemical Consultants.
While he has no experience as an industrial executive, he has been associated
with Bank financed projects and has demonstrated the drive and initiative
needed for this new assignment.  Furthermore, NFC's Chairman has been given
freedom to offer salaries to attract experienced industrial executives, and
as necessary, he will seek additional senior management with industrial experi-
ence. The selected project manager, Mr. Zahur Ahmad Khan, has been with NFC
and its predecessors for about 20 years and has the technical knowledge and
ability to direct work at the site. He also has general familiarity with the
existing facilities.
2.04      The existing plant will be operated by the present experienced
General Manager, Mr. Hafizullah, under the Managing Director's control. After
the project is completed and operation of the old and new plants integrated,
reassignments are anticipated.



D.  Financial History of Existing Facilities
2.05      Detailed historical and forecast financial statements for the
existing Multan facilities without the project are contained in Annex 2-2.
As the project will replace the existing ammonia units and provide the old
urea and ANL units with new ammonia, the financial history of Multan bears
little relation to the project or PFL. Also, fertilizer price changes in
Pakistan in August 1973 and the up-grading of the urea product by prilling
have considerably changed the financial outlook of the existing unit.
2.06      Capacity of the existing plants is about 70,000 tpy of N based on
the 200 tpd ammonia units. However, the production since 1969 in terms of
N has been as follows:
Multan Production of Nitrogen
('000 tons of N)
Year Ended June 30                 1969      1970     1971      1972      1973
Urea                           21       21        15        12        6
ANL                            17       22        22        20       16
38       43        37       32        22
Results for 1973 were adversely affected by strikes and compressor failures.
Production forecasts for the next three years show 42,000 tpy of N split
evenly between urea and ANL. This can be achieved but will depend primarily
on the sustained operation of the old ammonia units.
2.07      Financially the Multan operation has shown a total net profit of
only PRs 14 million over the five years, 1969-73, after a subsidy 1/ of PRs 120
million from the provincial and central governments. Cash generation (including
the subsidy) over the period was PRa 100 million. With higher fertilizer prices,
(para. 3.13) NFC requires less subsidy and Multan is expected to show improved
financial results during project implementation. However, the financing plan
for the project does not take into account any cash generation that may be
contributed by the existing plant. Of the original PRs 237 million investment
made during the early 1960's (about US$50 million at the then current exchange
rate), the Multan unit had by June 30, 1973 transferred PRs 207 million to
WPIDC in lieu of debt repayments in addition to 7% interest on the investment
(less transfers).
E.   Transfer of Existing Operations to PFL
2.08      NFC intends to retain ownership of the existing operation until
the project is completed to utilize the depreciation, tax and subsidy con-
cessions granted to the unit. Upon project completion, NFC will transfer
1/   The subsidy was based on a margin of 6% between operating cost and
revenue including the subsidy.



the existing Multan fertilizer business to PFL at which time these conces-
sions will expire. Pending such transfer NFC has agreed to limit its annual
capital expenditures relating to the Multan business to US$1 million equivalent.
III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
3.01      Past and projected consumption and production of fertilizer in
Pakistan, with special reference to the Province and District where the
project will be located, are detailed in Annex 3-1. An international con-
sumption pattern is also given for comparison (Annex 3-2).
A. Past Fertilizer Growth in Pakistan
3.02      Historically, Pakistan's nitrogen fertilizer consumption has greatly
exceeded domestic production, but with respect to phosphate fertilizer, this
has only been true since the mid-1960's, up to which time consumption was very
low and even less than the capacity of the only two existing small super-
phosphate plants (about 8,000 tpy of P205). The difference has been made up
by imports as shown in the following table. In 1972/73, imports of N and
P205 represented about 34% and 84% respectively of consumption, equivalent
to a CIF value of some US$60 million at the then-prevailing prices.

3.03      In the four years, 1970-1973, annual growths in N and P205 consump-
tion averaged 20% and 6% respectively, which for nitrogen (the only nutrient
for which a market forecast was made at that time) is slightly above the rate
predicted in the 1968 DH appraisal report. However, earlier tonnages, espe-
cially for phosphates were small and past growth rates, therefore, are unre-
liable indicators of future trends. Potash consusption is entirely based on
imports and is extremely low, being mostly used on tobacco. It is estimated



-6-
that acttual fertilizer consumption would have grown faster, were it not for
scme of the constraints described in Section E below; these have been, in
particular, lack of the foreign exchange to import fertilizer, and more re-
cently the scarcity of fertilizer on world markets, coupled with unprecedented
price increases.
B. Fertilizer Forecast for Pakistan
3.04      Demand estimates prepared by experienced agronomists in Pakistan
and based 'on likely crop patterns as well as production forecasts, taking
into account existing and probable additional fertilizer capacity (Multan
and Fauji) are summarized below. These are detailed in Annex 3-2 and
represent average annual growth rates of 11% for N and 21% for P205.
…----Nitrogen (N)-----          ----Phosphorus (P205)       -  Potash (K20)

1973/74     430        281        149        60         9         51          10
1974/75     475:       290        185        73        10         63          15
1975/76     530        292        238        90        10         80          20
1976/77     590        346        244       108        40         68          25
1977/78     650        551         99      130         72         58          30
1978/79     720        678         42.     155        104         51          35
1979/80      790       697         93       185       112         73          40
1980/81     875        697        178       220       124         96          45
It can be seen that even after the Multan and Fauji projects will have come
on stream (expe'ted for 1977 and 1978 respectively), Pakistan would still
have to import fertilizer to meet predicted demand for both N and P205.  The
above forecasts are about in the middle of various demand predictions, so
that maximum fertilizer use in 1980/81 could be some 15% and 20% above the
respective N and P205 forecasts used here.  Furthermore, Pakistan's fertilizer
application rates are still among the lowest in the world and on a per capita
basis are below those of India. Finally, Pakistan has still a very high N/P205
application ratio of about 9/1 as compared to a world average of 1.6/1. Even
accounting for varying soil conditions, there is therefore much room for
Pakistan to increase its usage of phosphate fertilizer. Furthermore, prompt
additional use of phosphates (and potassium later) is essential, otherwise
much of the extra nitrogen added and the benefits of planting high-yielding
varieties of wheat, rice and other crops will be wasted. This matter was
emphasized during negotiations.
C. Fertilizer Forecast For the Project's Principal Marketing Area
3.05      As indicated in Annex 3-1, the Punjab (the major market area of the
project) reprev-ents some 65% of the country's cropped acreage and produces
oYter 70% of it. !.a_or crops.  This province, together with the North West
i!  :^ier Province (NWFP), an adjoining small potential market area for the
p.L, 4accounted for 75% of Pakistan's N and P205 consumption during the last



-7 -
three years. Based on agronomic forecasts, this proportionate demand is
expected to continue, thus giving the following projected demand and pro-
duction pattern for these two provinces.

D. Competition
3.06      The above production projections for nitrogen conservatively assume
that the Fauji Foundation will proceed with the larger of two project alterna-
tives (530,000 tpy of urea or 240,000 tpy of N) and that all its output would
be available in the Punjab and the NWFP. While the Fauji plant would be
built in the Punjab, its proposed location is, however, only some 40 km from
the Punjab/Sind border and most of its natural market therefore would be in
the Sind. On the other hand, the Multan plant lies in the Multan District
and thus in the heart of the main marketing area which consumes 64% of N sales
in the entire Punjab Province, and is some 330 km distant from the envisaged
Fauji plant.  Therefore, even if the larger Fauji plant were to be built and
even if some excess of nitrogen fertilizer appears in the Punjab during the
late 1970's (as indicated by the above table), no really significant competi-
tion is foreseen.
3.07      Regarding P205 competition, the only other phosphate plant that
has been sanctioned to date is a monoammonium phosphate (MAP) plant at
Karachi, based on imported phosphoric acid. In addition phosphate rock has
been discovered in the NWFP and consideration of a fertilizer plant near the
deposits is under study. As phosphate fertilizer is likely to continue to
be in short supply throughout the forecast period, and the Karachi project
would be about 800 km distant from Multan, competition would be insignificant,
especially as the MAP is expected to find ready sales in the Sind. Projected
domestic N and P205 production and demand in the project's marketing area are
compared in tabular and graphic form in Annex 3-3.

E.   Credit Availability and Other Constraints
3.08      Many large and medium sized farms can pay cash or obtain short-
term loans for fertilizers and other needs, such as from the Agricultural
Bank at about 8% interest, but millions of subsistence cultivators have had
no access to credit on favorable terms. The Government planned to make PRs
775 million credit available to the poorer farmers in 1973/74, via commercial
banks, agricultural supply corporations, cooperatives and the Agricultural
Development Bank. Also, the newly-formed Punjab Agricultural Su;rplies Corpo-
ration (PASC) intends not only to bring fertilizer and other inputs to the
poorer rural areas but also to provide credit to purchase them. It is intended
that some of these loans would be interest-free and be secured by future crops.
Nevertheless, as the potential for increasing agricultural output is largest
with the great number of small farms and increased fertilizer for such small
farms has been assumed in the projections, the Government has agreed to make
available to the Bank by December 31, 1974 a detailed description of an agri-
cultural credit program to be prepared and implemented by the Government
throughout Pakistan, and has agreed to afford to the Bank reasonable oppor-
tunity to comment thereon. Such credit facilities will become increasingly
important as fertilizer consumption in Pakistan is expected to continue
rising during the remainder of this decade.
3.09      Other major actual and potential constraints include increasing
international fertilizer prices and decreasing fertilizer availability, limited
water supplies, fixed crop prices and poor farmer education. Most farms are
totally dependent on irrigation or uncertain rainfall and during the early
months of 1970 and 1971, river and well levels were the lowest in 100 years.
However, completion of the Tarbela Dam in 1974 will help to provide more regu-
lar irrigation. Lack of sufficient fertilizer due to foreign exchange restric-
tions and limited domestic production has curtailed use and appreciation of
the benefits fertilizers provide. Greater availability from the expanded
Multan plant will help to remedy this situation. Crop prices have a great
influence on fertilizer use and the Government has tended to delay price
increases because of political repercussions; however, grain prices were
raised recently and the cost benefit ratio of fertilizer to crops should
remain attractive even after further fertilizer price increases. Regarding
farmer education, producers in both the public and private sectors undertake
fertilizer campaigns and demonstrations, but much additional work needs to
be done, especially in promoting greater use of phosphates. The Government
has agreed that it will make available to the Bank by December 31, 1974 a
study of improvements needed in fertilizer promotion and marketing to be
carried out by the Government and afford to the Bank opportunity to comment
thereon. The Government has also agreed to import nitrophosphate or similar
phosphatic fertilizer into Multan's marketing area (equivalent to about 50,000,
100,000 and 150,000 tpy of nitrophosphate in the years ending June 1974, 1975
and 1976 respectively) during project implementation to prepare the farmers
for increased availability of phosphate once the project is completed and at
the same time, obtain a better N/P ratio sooner.



-9-
F. Transportation
3.10      Recent experience of Dawood Hercules and at Multan shows road trans-
port to be speedier and cheaper, if distances from plant to distribution cen-
ters are under 250 to 300 km. As typical distances between Multan and the
major warehouses are 130 to 160 km, it is estimated that about two-thirds of
the project's output will be moved by road and one-third by rail. Multan has
a big truck depot and truckers are anxious to obtain extra loads. Regarding
rail transport, Multan is about 60 km south and 100 km north of two of the
largest make-up yards in the country, hence no difficulty is anticipated in
obtaining empty wagons and rapid turnarounds. Discussions with the railway
authorities revealed no anticipated difficulties either in moving heavy
equipment, phosphate rock and "seeding" fertilizer supplies from Karachi to
Multan, or hauling finished fertilizer to railhead towns in the quantities
required. Furthermore, agricultural materials are second in priority only
to military needs.
G. Fertilizer Distribution
3.11      From 1967 to October 1973, fertilizers were distributed and sold
either by producers or by a group of Principal Agents, who had representatives
in the mandi (market) towns throughout the country. In October 1973, the
Punjab Provincial Government re-entered fertilizer marketing and issued a
decree taking over full distribution and sales from all private and public
sector plants (except Esso which has an agreement with the Central Govern-
ment to undertake its own sales of which only 15% are sold in the Punjab).
Dawood Hercules obtained a concession to distribute half of its urea output
as it wishes; the remainder being handled by the Punjab Agricultural Supply
Corporation (PASC). However, the Multan plant has been instructed to sell
all its current and future production through PASC.
3.12      This restricted marketing may place the Multan project at a serious
disadvantage compared to other producers because PASC is inexperienced in this
field. Also, absence of competition in marketing Multan's products because of
sole distribution and selling rights could reduce the educational and sal?s
efforts needed to increase fertilizer use - especially by farmers with little
or no experience of proper fertilizer application. Therefore, the Government
has agreed that it will enable PFL to utilize or establish an efficient distri-
bution network to market the project's production; the performance of the
network to be subject to periodic Bank review. While it is intended that
PASC should undertake this marketing, the representatives of the Government
recognized during negotiations that the network could be either the public
or private sector or a combination.
H. Prices
3.13      At full capacity utilization, the expanded Multan plant will produce
the following types and quantities of fertilizer (in tpy): CAN 450,000;
nitrophosphate 306,000; urea 72,600 and some 50,000 tons of ammonium nitrate
limestone (ANL). Gazetted retail prices at farmer level after the latest
increases in August 1973 are:



- 10 -
Pakistan - Selected Retail Fertilizer Prices
(per ton of product)
PRs         US$
CAN (26% N)                                490          49
Nitrophosphate (23% N, 23% P205)         1,100         110
Urea (46% N)                             1,100         110
DAP (18% N, 46% P205)                    1,190         119
3.14      In many countries, a unit of P205 sells for more than the same
(weight) unit of N, because of higher manufacturing costs, due to appreciable
phosphate rock prices and the need for sulfur as a processing material, wqhich
is subsequently thrown away as waste gypsum. While Multan nitrophosphate will
be produced without using sulfur (as no sufficient indigenous sources are
known) thus avoiding substantial recurring foreign exchange expenditures,
farmers purchasing Multan nitrophosphate (with the same (46%) nutrient con-
tent as urea) for the same price as urea will do so on favoratble terms.
3.15      Fertilizer prices are set periodically by the Government based on
several factors including the relation between crop and fertilizer prices,
domestic production costs and import prices. Current farmer-level prices
are less than half of CIF import prices, but double retail levels prevailing
in mid-1972. About 35% of domestic ex-plant fertilizer prices are paid back
by the producers to the Government as a "development charge", to help offset
losses to the Government on higher priced imported fertilizer sold below cost,
along with other objectives. Thus producers receive only about 60% of the
retail price, with a 5% additional margin being paid to distributors. How-
ever, even allowing for an assumed PRs 300 per ton development charge for
nitrophosphate fertilizer, production costs are competitive and the project
is profitable as detailed in Chapter VI.
3.16      It is the policy of the Government to follow a pricing policy for
fertilizer that will permit a reasonable return on investment. International
(ex-works) prices provide an important guideline for setting domestic ferti-
lizer prices at the factory level, although the special factors affecting the
cost structure of the Pakistan fertilizer industry (i.e., high degree of
reliance on relatively low-cost domestic natural gas) will also have to be
taken into account. The Government has agreed to exercise its right of price
control in such a manner as not to prevent PFL under certain operating assump-
tions, from being able to earn a return on its equity each year of at least
15%.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives, Scope and Project Description
4.01      The project is to produce simultaneously nitrogen and phosphate
fertilizers to help mitigate current shortages of both nutrients in Pakistan,
using domestic resources to the maximum extent possible. The existing in-
efficient ammonia units will be shut down and replaced by one large, modern,
910 tpd plant that will feed a new 1,020 tpd prilled nitrophosphate (NP) unit;
a new 1,500 tpd prilled CAN unit; plus the existing urea and ANL units that
are in course of being modified to produce 220 tpd prilled urea and 200 to
300 tpd granular CAN. Based on the new ammonia plant achieving 90% of an-
nual capacity, Multan would produce about 275,000 tpy of NP (22.5% N and
22.5% P205); 30,000 additional tpy of urea (46% N); and 425,000 tpy of extra
CAN (26% N) equivalent to an additional 187,000 tpy of N and 63,000 of P205.
At the same time existing facilities, offsites and labor will be used to
the optimum extent.
4.02      Nitrophosphates are not new or distinctive fertilizer compounds but
mixtures of traditional fertilizer materials - ammonium phosphate and amonium
nitrate made by dissolving phosphate rock in nitric acid produced from ammonia.
A product having a phosphate water-solubility of at least 80% will ensure
agronomic results fully comparable with those based on phosphates such as
triple superphosphate (TSP) or diammonium phosphate (DAP) made by dissolving
phosphate rock in sulphuric acid (Annex 3-3). These alternatives, as well as
the production of urea were studied and compared, as were plants of different
sizes. The products and processes chosen, as well as the plant sizes selected
represent the optimum combination for this specific project at the expected
level of fertilizer use and nutrient combination in Multan's marketing area.
4.03      The project is detailed in Annex 4-1 and the flow chart for the
existing and new facilities is shown in Annex 4-2. Ammonia will be produced
from steam-reformed natural gas in a single train, and latest proven tech-
nology based on steam turbine-driven centrifugal compressors will be used.
The,selected engineering firm for design and construction of the ammonia plant
and offsites is Kellogg International Corporation Ltd. (U.K.) who will also
be responsible for general coordination and supervision of the entire project.
The selected engineering firm for design and construction of the nitric acid,
NP and CAN plants is Uhde GmbH (FRG). The ammonia plant will use the Kellogg
process, the nitric acid and CAN units will use Uhde technology and the NP plant
will be based on Dutch States Mines process design. The various production
processes are described in Annex 4-3. The new facilities will be built within
the existing plant boundaries as shown in the layout in Annex 4-4.
B. Raw Materials and Utilities
4.04      The availability and supply of the principal raw materials are de-
scribed in more detail in Annex 4-5; these will be natural gas to be supplied
by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) from their Sui field some 300 km
distant and phosphate rock from Jordan or elsewhere. Gas reserves are ample
but existing needs of the Multan plant will have to be supplemented by con-
structing additional loops. The Government has agreed to finance on terms



- 12 -
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, the cost of the additional invest-
ments required for the gas supply (amounting to 1.56 million cubic meters,
or 55 million cubic feet per day at full production including 10% contingency).
In addition, it is a condition of effectiveness of the Loan that Sui Northern
shall have agreed to supply to PFL such amount of gas on a long-term basis
as from June 30, 1976. Phosphate rock has been purchased by WPIDC from Jordan
for many years and this can be extended to meet the needs of Multan (about
220,000 tpy). In view of rapidly increasing world demand for phosphate rock,
it is a condition of effectiveness of the Loan that satisfactory arrangements
for the supply of phosphate rock to PFL shall have been made.
4.05      Major utilities are power, natural gas for steam generation and
water. The plant will produce its own power via steam raised in waste-heat
recovery units and gas-fired boilers. Water for processing and cooling
purposes will come from nearby deep wells.
4.06      Adequate supplies of bags are essential and, in addition to poly-
ethylene-lined cotton bags now used, alternatives such as woven polyprophylene
bags are being studied as well as bag-recycling. The Government has agreed
to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the supply to PFL of the
necessary quantity of fertilizer bags for the operation of the Multan plant
and to make available to the Bank for review by June 30, 1975 a program for
the production of such bags.
C.   Basis for Location and Product Mix
4.07      As reviewed in Annex 3-2 Multan is in the heart of the major agri-
cultural area of the Punjab and is therefore ideally located in terms of
marketing and distribution as well as nearness to its major feedstock -
natural gas. The existing plant is well connected by road and rail to the
rest of the Province and the country. It has ample room for expansion and
has its own housing colony, plus plentiful additional labor resources in
Multan city. Management, supervisors and operators are well experienced in
most of the fertilizer technology applied in the project. Expanding Multan
is therefore logical. The product mix suits the fertilizer application
pattern for many crops, namely, a 1:1 N to P205 ratio for basal (seed bed)
application as nitrophosphate, followed by a subsequent top dressing of an
all nitrogen fertilizer such as CAN or urea.
D. Ecology and Safety Considerations
4.08      These are reviewed in detail in Annex 4-6.  Appreciable volumes of
harmless water vapor and carbon dioxide will be vented to the atmosphere.
Fluorine vapors resulting from impurities in phosphate rock will be recovered
before venting exhaust gases to the atmosphere, and rendered harmless by
appropriate chemical treatment. Nitrogen oxide vapors from the old and new



- 13 -
nitric acid plants will be reduced to acceptable levels. Dusts will be
minimized in the interests of economy as well as ecology, and it was agreed
that the entire plant will meet gaseous and liquid pollution levels now
required in populated areas of Europe or USA, to be monitored by the Govern-
ment. Safety and fire precautions will also meet standards acceptable over-
seas.
E. Labor Force and Training
4.09      About 1,700 people are currently employed in the Multan plant which
is more than double present actual needs. This labor surplus will be ample
to operate the additional process units and meet expanded handling, bagging
and other requirements, thus helping to reduce present plant overstaffing.
Key supervisory and technical personnel (who are already experienced in
ammonia, nitric acid and CAN production) will be given training in large
ammonia, NP and CAN plants overseas, in accordance with a plan to be prepared
by the Technical Advisor. Some PFL staff will spend time on design and pro-
curement in the offices of the plant contractors (Kellogg and Uhde).
F. Project_Implementation, Procurement and Construction
4.10      As mentioned, Kellogg has been selected to design and construct
the ammonia plant, offsites and tie-ins of existing and new facilities and
Uhde to design and construct the nitric acid, NP and CAN units. Both were
chosen after international competition. Procurement of equipment and mate-
rials will be undertaken in London and DDrtmund by PFL together with Kellogg
and Uhde specialists. The design and construction of civil works (which are
being financed by the Government) will be performed by qualified domestic
firms under the supervision of Kellogg. Financing of Kellogg's services will
be assisted by the proposed Bank loan, while the nitric acid, NP and CAN
plants' engineering will be financed by ADB. With the exception of pro-
prietary equipment (estimated to cost US$1 million equivalent) and critical
items affecting the process guarantees and/or the project completion schedule
(estimated to cost US$4 million equivalent), all orders over an estimated
US$25,000 to be financed by the proposed Bank loan will be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding under the Bank's guidelines. Suppliers for
critical items will be recommended by Kellogg based on their experience,
delivery times and competitive prices. Qualified Pakistani bidders will be
given a preference of 15% or the customs duties for non-exempt importers,
whichever is lower. To expedite the project and avoid retroactive financing,
preliminary engineering costs and down payments on long delivery items will
be financed from equity. On this basis design work commenced in early 1974
and the construction is to be completed by the end of 1976. The anticipated
schedule is depicted in Annex 4-7; this schedule is tight but achievable,
provided equipment delivery times are not significantly prolonged on account
of the sharp increase in the construction of fertilizer plants in the world.

4.11      To coordinate the project and assist PFL during design, procurement
and construction, a Technical Advisor team from Stamicarbon (Netherlands)
with experience in large-scale production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizer
including nitrophosphate has been engaged. This team can be retained after
plant start-up for a period satisfactory to the Bank to help assure that
production can quickly reach and be sustained at a high level of capacity.
Close liaison between the Technical Advisor and PFL's local consultants
(Chemical Consultants Ltd.) will be maintained throughout.
4.12      To ensure that delays and extra costs will not arise due to im-
port procedures, the Bank has obtained assurances that import licenses will
be issued promptly according to an agreed Critical Path Schedule. It was
also stated by the representatives of the Government during negotiations that
with certain minor exceptions, imported equipment, materials and other items
needed for the project will be free of import duties, as assumed in the
capital cost estimates.
4.13      Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) will be responsible for
construction of the expansion of the capacity of the Multan line, by June 30,
1976, in time for testing the gas line and the fertilizer facilities. The
Bank in its supervision of its loans to SNGPL is following the pipeline
project. As PFL's Managing Director designate is SNGPL's former Technical
Manager the necessary close coordination between PFL and SNGPL should be
assured.
4.14      The Government representatives also agreed that a proposed heavy
water plant to be based on PnL's ammonia plant facilities will not interfere
with PFL's operations and that PFL will be compensated for any additional
capital or opcrating costs as a consequence of the heavy water plant.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Cost
5.01      The project is estimated to require total financing amounting to
PRs 1,007 million (US$101.7 million) with the local currency portion accounting
for about 23%. Ay July 1, 1976 the fixed assets of the existing plant will be
transferred from NFC to PFL at PRs 46.7 million (US$4.7 million). The de-
tails of capital cost estimate are given in Annex 5-1 and its summary is
given in the table below:

5.02      The foreign exchange estimates are based on fixed engineering fees,
indicative equipment costs prepared by the winning engineering firms in February
1974 and civil construction costs in Pakistan in March 1974. Foreseeable es-
calation through March 1974 and contingencies of 10% are already included in



- 16 -
these costs, i.e., outside the contingencies separately shown. It has been
assumed that all equipment will be imported although a small percentage may
be fabricated in Pakistan at competitive costs.' Thus, there may be some
savings in foreign exchange compared to the above estimates.
5.03      A 10% contingency allowance has been made on the fixed engineer-
ing bids and on the indicative equipment cost items. In addition, a 10%
allowance for price escalation has been made on all equipment costs. Con-
sidering the advanced stage of the project and assuming equipment orders
are placed over the next 9 months, the escalation provisions appear reason-
able. They have been revised following negotiations in the light of worldwide
developments since the original estimates were prepared in mid-1973. Local
costs are based on new contracts being negotiated by construction firms.
To this has lbeen added 7-1/2% for contingencies, and at this time, these
estimates appear reasonable. Although not part of the project's capital
costs, the additional gas line loops are expected to cost PRs 107 million.
B. Working Capital
5.04      Using conservative assumptions (Annex 5-2) for the level of receiv-
ables, inventories and cash, the Bank has estimated maximum current assets
during the first operating year (1977) to be about PRa 200 million, of which
some 70% could be financed by normal working capital credits. The balance
would be provided in equity. Thus, we have used PRs 88 million as a con-
servative amount to be included in the financing requirements for the initial
working capital. Of this, PRs 18 million is assumed to be required in foreign
exchange for imported raw materials, primarily phosphate rock.
C. Financing Plan
5.05      The proposed financing plan is based on a concept of about 64% debt
and 36% equity. Of the equity, about 30% is to be provided by ADNOC. The
balance of the equity is to come from the Government through NPC, in local
currency and - to the extent necessary to meet the project's needs - in
foreign exchange (about US$5 million equivalanet). The ADB signed their
US$27 million equivalent loan in January 1974, and ADNOC paid its initial
equity subscription also in January 1974. The Government has agreed to
finance any local currency or foreign exchange overrun on the project, assure
that PFL has a maximum debt/equity ratio of 65/35 at project completion date, 1/
and cover all costs of the related gas pipeline within the time required by
the project. In addition assurances have been obtained that (i) the Govern-
ment will provide sufficient funds to NFC to allow it to subscribe in cash
for its portion of PFL's share capital and in the time as required by the
project; and (ii) share capital can be used for foreign exchange expenditures
by the conversion of rupees, as necessary.
1/   Project completion is defined as one continuous month of production
at 80% capacity.

5.07      The ADB loan to the Government consists of US$7.75 million in
Special Funds and US$19.25 million in Ordinary Funds on standard ADB terms 1/.
Both loan portions would be re-lent to PFL at 9-1/2X per annum. The proposed
Bank loan would be made to PFL at the standard interest rate plus a guarantee
fee to be paid by PFL to the Government to raise the rate to 9-1/2x. All
long-term loans, including local loans to the Company would be for 15 years
including a four year grace period. The foreign exchange risk on the ADB
and IBRD loans would remain with the Company until the loans are repaid.
D. Allocation and Disbursement
5.08      The proposed Bank loan would be used to finance Stamicarbon's and
Kellogg's services and equipment for the ammonia plant and utilities under
procedures described in para 4.10. The following two tables show (i) a
breakdown of project costs by sources of funds; and (ii) the allocation of
the proposed Bank loan. Disbursement forecasts for the loan are given in
Annex 5-3.
1/   Special Funds  -  1Z p.a. interest with a 10-year grace period and
30 years repayment (2% for 10 years and 4% for
20 years).
Ordinary Funds -  7-1/2% p.a. interest and repayments from 1978 through
1988 with even payments of principal and interest.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A. Basis of Analysis
6.01      As mentioned, the project will produce ammonia for the existing
nitric acid, urea and ANL plants as well as the new nitric acid, 11? and CAN
plants. In calculating the economic and financial returns, the entire
production from the old and new plants are taken as benefits and the existing
facilities are taken at their depreciated value as of June 30, 1976.
6.02      Project expenditures by source are estimated as follows:
Multan - Project Expenditures by Source

Total                 15     148      579     312    1 054
Some of the guarantee payments on equipment will only be made in 1977 but
these are relatively small and have therefore no substantial effect on the
financial and economic analyses.
B. Operating Costs and Revenues
6.03      Detailed operating costs for each of the major products of the
expanded plant are shown in Annex 6-1 and are summarized below:



- 20 -
Multan - Estimated Product Costs
(incl. depreciation, financial charges and bags)
PRs/ton       US$/ton
Ammonia                                     350           35.4
Nitrophosphate                              700           70.7
CAN
-Existing Plant                           380           38.4
-New Plant                                345           34.8
Urea                                        380           38.4
Marginal labor costs for the expanded production will be minimal as the
present facilities are overstaffed and labor intensive activities will not
be significantly expanded. Raw material and feedstock sources have been
described in Chapter IV, para 4.04, and the prices used for financial analysis
are shown in Annex 6-1. For phosphate rock US$40--CIF Karachi has been
assumed as the appropriate long-term price. This is consistent with other
current Bank projects and is considered reasonable for 1978. In the interim,
phosphate rock prices are expected to be considerably higher due to temporary
supply shortages. The gas price assumed, PRa 3.21 per thousand cubic feet
(MSCF) at 90% capacity, is PRs 0.50/MSCP above the current price to take into
account the rate covenant in the IBRD loans to SNGPL 1/, that will require an
increased gas price after SNGPL's expansion, including the Multan line. Other
costs are current market prices. To calculate product costs on a per-ton
basis, fixed and variable costs have been allocated where necessary on a
nutrient-ton basis.
6.04      Retail fertilizer prices in Pakistan are currently substantially
lower than world prices as discussed in Chapter III, para 3.15. Net ex-factory
prices are even lower as a consequence of the development charge paid to the
Government to assist in paying for imports. For example December 1973 imported
urea prices, CIF Karachi ranged between US$140 and 160/ton (with some consider-
ably higher quotations known to exist) as compared to the US$65/ton net ex-fac-
tory price at Multan. For the financial forecasts and return calculations,
current prices (shown below) have been increased about 20% to reflect the
agreement which will allow PFL to obtain a rate of return on equity of 15%
per annum at 90% capacity.

/1   Retail prices less freight, distributors' allowances and development
charges.
/2   Current market price less assumed development charge of PRs 300/ton.
No nitrophosphate is currently produced in Pakistan.
Under present policies ex-factory price increases to compensate for cost
increases will depend on crop prices, costs of imported fertilizer and the
rate of return permitted. Higher ex-factory prices can be achieved by
reducing the development charge or by increasing farmer's prices.
C. Financial Indicators
6.05      Forecast income statements, sources and application of funds and
balance sheets through 1981 are contained in Annex 6-2. The table on page 23
summarizes the statements.
D. Profitability and Financial Return
6.06      The profitability of PFL will depend largely on the ability of manage-
ment to complete the project on time, commission it expeditiously, and reach
capacity utilization early. The projections show a real financial return
after taxes of 17% on invested capital based on a 90% maximum capacity utili-
zation reached in the second full production year; a 12-year operating life;
and other assumptions shown in Annex 6-3. Sensitivity tests have been per-
formed as follows:



- 2 2-
Financial Return and Sensitivity Tests
-Base Case  -  After Taxes                            17
Before Taxes                          23
-2C% Increase in Project Cost and
12 months delay in construction                  13
-20% Decrease in Revenues                              6
-Gas Costs Increased 100%                             13
-Phosphate Rock Costs Increased 20%                   16
From an equity point of view, the discounted return would be over 25%.  At
current sales prices the profit breakeven point is estimated to be 62% and
the cash breakeven point 50% (Annex 6-4). The above returns reflect the
relatively low additional investment requirements on account of the largely
existing infrastructure and the favorable feedstock price, measured by today's
world standards of traded hydrocarbon resources.
E.   Financial Position, Debt Service Coverage and Financial Covenants
6.07      With 15% dividend payments assumed to start in 1979, projections
show a current ratio of 1.4:1 or better for all years and a long-term debt/
equity ratio of less than 60/40 after 1977. These ratios are sound and con-
sidered achievable. Debt service would be covered 1.8 times from 1978 on-
ward, the first year full loan repayment is due.
6.08      To ensure the financial viability of PFL, the following agreements
have been obtained: (a) the Government will take all necessary action to
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5:1 as at Project Completion Date and
thereafter of 1.2:1 and to assure that as at Project Completion Date the debt
equity ratio of PFL shall be no more than 65:35; (b) further long-term bor-
rowing and investments in fixed assets without prior approval of the Bank be
limited to no more than US$3 million equivalent per year: (c) for purposes of
incurring debt the debt service coverage to be maintained at not less than
1.5 times; and (d) limitation of dividends or other cash outlays, including
debt pre-payments, to prior earnings and subject to the maintenance of a cur-

- 24 -
F.   Major Risks
6.09      The major potential financial risks foreseen are:  delays in com-
pleting the project due to a world wide increase in plant construction and
equipment demand; difficulties in reaching adequate capacity utilization; cost
escalations due to the boom in the fertilizer equipment maiufacturing industry,
inflation and further currency realignments; delays in the delivery of gas;
untested management arrangements; introduction of a relatively new product;
distribution uncertainties; and a potential shortage of bags. These risks
have been reduced to acceptable levels by the use of proven processes and
experienced contractors, detailed cost estimates with appropriate contin-
gencies; Bank supervision of the gas transmission company; use of a technical
advisor and competent local consultants and studies of the distribution
system and alternative bagging materials and a promotion program during con-
struction based on imported nitrophosphate.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. International Fertilizer Prices
7.01      In view of shortages of fertilizer, increased investment costs,
high freight rates, rising prices for raw materials and the general effect
of currency realignments, fertilizer prices have reached historic highs. 1/
However, it is estimated by the Bank that lhrge new plants, with natural
gas such as in the Persian Gulf, will be able to sell their production on
the world market and earn an attractive return, in 1978 at US$110/ton for
urea and US$150/ton for DAP (bulk FOB Persian Gulf) the two main sources
of N and P in international trade. Exporting countries, which do not have
the advantages of low-cost feedstocks might set prices US$10-20 higher.
Historic low3 for urea were about US$55 in the mid-1960's and prices are over
US$200 today. Whether countries with surplbses will actually sell at the
indicated prices in the late 1970's and early 1980's will depend on market
forces. Supply is not expected to catch up with demand for at least three or
four years.
1/   In the last half of the 1960's, investments in new plants by traditional
and new producers, especially petroleum companies, as well as improved
technology led to large stocks, despite rising consumption in developed
and developing countries (respectively 15X and 8X annually). As prices
and profits declined, the oil companies rapidly lost interest and plants
were closed down or contracted out; others were delayed and failed to
reach expected capacities. With the market growing rapidly, the inven-
tories disappeared and today's tight stapply situation resulted.



- 25 -
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.02      To calculate a realistic economic rate of return under current
uncertainties is difficult. Using US$130/ton for urea and US$170/ton 1/for
DAP, both CIF Karachi in bulk form, plus US$15/ton for bags and freight
from Karachi to warehouses in the Punjab would give ex-factory prices of
US$145/ton for urea, Us$140 for NP and US$88 for CAN; these prices have
been used for the economic return calculation of this project.
7.03      The cost of gas for the economic return has been taken at US$1.40
per 1,000 cubic feet equivalent to US$54/ton or US$8 per barrel for fuel oil.
This is necessarily an arbitrary assumption based on the Bank's review of the
opportunity cost of gas for gas based fertilizer projects (Annex 7-1 page 3).
Market prices, as in the financial return have been used for other raw
materials. It was established that the gas to be used did not have a near-
term alternative domestic use such as replacing oil imports 2/ and that
exporting gas (which is not contemplated) would require transportation and
transformation costs which would partially offset increased prices if exports
of liquified gas were used for the opportunity cost of gas.
7.04      Using the above assumptions and fund flows as detailed in Annex 7-1
the project shows an economic return of 34% at 90% capacity utilization on
the basis of a 12-year operating life. The economic return is twice the
financial return due to the elimination of high income taxes (60.5%) and the
use of forecast international fertilizer pr4ees which are more than twice
the current ex-factory prices in Pakistan. The economic return is sensitive
to selling prices, and gas and phosphate rock costs. However, the assumed
prices have been calculated on a basis consistent with assumed costs and
therefore if input costs are raised, it is likely that international prices
will remain at levels which would provide good returns to the least cost
producers. Sensitivity tests have been performed assuming a 12-month delay
in start-up, maximum production of 80% and a 10% overrun on capital costs.
Under the most adverse foreseeable combination of factors, the economic
return is not expected to fall below 20%.
C. Foreign Exchange Savings
7.05      The estimated annual net foreign exchange savings attributable to
the project at 90% capacity is US$50 million and the foreign exchange invest-
ment of about US$78 million can be recovered in less than two years (Annex 7-2).
1/   This is consistent with a price of US$40/ton CIF for rock phosphate used
as an economic cost.
2/   As indicated in Annex 4-5 latest estimates of Sui reserves are 8.9 trillion
cubic feet out of which 4.9 trillion are committed. The project will
demand only about 4.3% of the uncommitted reserves over a 12-year operating
life.



- 26 -
D. Other Economic Benefits
7.06      The unmeasured economic benefits of management and technical train-
ing, and assured supplies of fertilizer, make this project particularly at-
tractive. It is of high priority in the context of the Government's policy
to attain self-sufficiency in food and to increase agricultural output and
exports, and it puts to profitable use a valuable national asset, natural gas,
which is presently under-utilized.

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS
1.        Following is a description of the technical terms used in this
report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements,
6 in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities.  Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc,
iron, aluminium, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen are readily available from the atmosphere and water.  Nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium -- three main nutrients -- and the other elements
are drawn from the soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials
containing the three main nutrients, soil is soon depleted of fertility by
cropping. Uele of organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can
be utilized but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far exceeded
the availability of natural "fertilizers." Consequently, the majority of the
world's primary plant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of manu-
factured or "chemical" fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary
nutrients such as calcium, magnesiua, sulfur, and micro nutrients such as
boron, zinc, copper and manganese are also added to soils along with the
primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists according to specific
crop and soil needs.
3.        Chemical Fertilizers:  Chemical compounds suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and hand-
ling problems; and readily water soluble and available to plant root systems.
Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a large
degree are:
Primary Fertilizer Materials
% of N                % of P20                   % of K20
Nutrient               Nutrient                    Nutrient
Urea               46%     Triple Super-          Potassium Chloride   61%
Armonium Nitrate   34%       phosphate    46%    Potassium Sulfate    54%
Amonium Sulfate    21%     Single Super-
Diammonium                   phosphate    18%
Phosphate        18%     Diammonium
Phosphate    46%
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and
potassium chloride (KCL), they are some of the most popular fertilizer
materials in the world today. It is the common practice to report the
nutrient content of materials in terms of percentages of N and P205
(phosphorus pentoxide) and potassium K20 (potassium oxide).



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
Complex or NPK Fertilizers: All three primary nutrients (N,
P205, K20) are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios
varying with the nutrient requirements of different crops. To facilitate
handling, the several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uni-
form granules for distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as
a ratio to describe the NPI product. Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer
contains 15% each of N, P205, and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer
contains 12% N, 2h% P205 and 12% K20.
5.          Phosphate Water Solubility:  The agronomic availability (or
efficiency) of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is
to use water solability as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less
significant factor. Higher P205 water solubility permits the fertilizer to
be absorbed more rapidly. The minimum recommended in most cases is about
60% solubility but in some cases up to80-85% solubility is preferred.
6.          Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric
acid. Nitric acid (HN03), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH3). AN contains
34.S5 niiirogen, half in the ammonium form and half in t1he nitrnte form, and
is very hydroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In many countries, a
diluent -- e.g. limestone -- is added to lower the analysis and negate the
explosive properties as well as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)or chemically (NH4)2HP04, is produced
by reactin-g NH3 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) followed by granulation and
drying.
8.        Partial Oxidation is a method of producing hydrogen from hydro-
carbon fuels of almost any type by a non-catalytic reaction with oxygen
followed by removal of the by-product, carbon monoxide.
9.        Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the
ammonia Jynthesis; in the propoaed Multan plant, the feedstock would be
natural gas which is usually the most economical choice when available.
Other potential feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite.
10.       Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CCNH2 - the normal
amide of caronic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the
awmonium form. It is considerably less hydroscopic than ammonium nitrate
and it is the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
11.        Urea Sythesia:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon
dioxide* Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia
synthesis, urea production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant.
Unfortunately, the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does
not form stable ammonium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.



ABEI 1-1
Page 3
Therefore, simple neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and
sulfate fertilizers is not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide
are combined under heat and pressure to make ammonium carbomate which,
although unstable, can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable
compound.  Againiunfortunately, the overall reaction is completely reversible
and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and 2000C, the conversion to urea in a
single pass through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several
complications: high pressure must be used to maximize conversion; unconverted
reactants must be separated and recycled; increased corrosion under the high
temperatures and pressures used musat be overcome, and urea decomposition into
undesirable products must be minimized. In recent years, several engineering
and producing companies have developed ways of surmounting these problems,
and large plants capable of producing a thousand tons per day, or more, of
urea to rigid chemical and physical specifications are now operating success-
fully for long periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and MeaBures
12.       The petroleum industry historically has used units of measure
based on the English measuring system. Conversion rates for some units
are given below:
1 barrel        = 2 US gallons;
. US gallon     = 0.95 liters = 0.00095 M3;
. ton crude oil = 7.0 barrels (approximately, based on the crude
oil specific gravity); and
1 ton oil         1.25 Y3 of natural gas (approximately, based
on oil and gas compositions)
The conversion rates between volumetric units, such as gallons, and weights
are approximate since the specific gravity of the oil varies slightly with
its composition.
13,       Materials that exist in the form of gases, such as methane
(natural gas), are measured in volumetric units. Since gases are compressible,
standard conditions of temperature and pressure (00 C and 1.0 atmosphere )
are used to define the quantity (in volume) of gas, and designated as
"normal cubic meters" or "normal cubic feet."

PAKISTAN
MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
Alternative Eroject-Scope Studies
Background
Prior to approaching the Bank in early 1972, the Government of
Pakistan had commissioned several studies on the Pakistan fertilizer
market and Multan plant expansion possibilities by companies such as
Humphreys and Glasgow Ltd. (UK), Arthur D. Little Inc. (USA), and Chemical
Consultants Ltd. (Pakistan). All indicated a need to produce and use more
phosphate fertilizer in addition to nitrogen. The availability of natural
gas in the country at reasonable prices, and the absence of indigenous sulfur
emphasized to these consultants the potential advantages of making nitrophos-
phates (NP). This was because (i) these products could be made by solubilizing
phosphate rock with nitric acid made from amronia produced from Pakistan's own
natural gas instead of using sulfuric acid made from imported sulfur; (ii) a
nitrophosphate such as 23-23-0 with the ;:l N to P205 ratio is
ideal for the major basal (seed) application markets; (iii) farmers who had not
previously used phosphate (because of unavailability or reluctance) would auto-
matically do so when applying nitrophosphate. Other reasons included a high
total nutrient content (46%), a familiarity and liking for_the co-product
calcium anmonium nitrate (CAN) by many Pakistani farmers, plus the extensive
experience of the Multan plant in making ammonia, nitric acid and CAN.
Most important, however, was the suitability of nitrophosphates for
Pakistan's soils and crops. This was studied intensively by international and
domestic agronomists with the general conclusion that modern nitrophosphates
havirg phosphate water solubilities up to 80% gave crop responses at least
comparable with mixtures of other N and P fertilizer such as anmonium nitrate,
anmoniui sulfate or urea, with diammonium phosphate and superphosphates (Annex 3-1).
Accordingly, WPIDC decided to produce NP in conjunction with more CAN, based on a
large new ammonia plant that would have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of
the existing CAN and urea units.
Possible Alternative Projects
Alternative Location
Various alternatives were investigated such as (i) building the
required additional facilities elsewhere; (ii) shutting down Multan and build-
ing a new NP/CAN plus urea plant with a capacity equal to the combined capacities
of the old and proposed new Multan plants at another site. The availability of
ample experienced labor, space, transportation and existing amenities at
l4ultan, plus operating downstream urea, nitric acid and CAN units outweighed
any potential advantage of relocation.

Alternative Products, Processes and Plant Sizes
At the request of the Bank, in early 1973, Chemical Consultants
Ltd., Pakistan, were asked to study the following alternative cases,
the larger ones were included as Multan was understood to be the only ferti-
lizer project sanctioned by GOP at that time.

As can be expected, economies of scale resulted in higher calculated
rates of return for the larger plants, but the cases based on a smaller ammonia
unit (1 and 5) are quite viable. However, Case 5 using imported MAP is highly
conjectural, as this material is unlikely to be readily available on the inter-
national market in reliable, substantial quantities for several years, and its
use would expose Pakistan's fertilizer and food production to foreign exchange
availability and other uncertainties. The rates of return comparisons are
shown below, for the conditions prevailing when the study was made:

Based on the larger plant sizes, producing urea-anmonium phosphate
from urea and MAP made at Multan (from imported sulfur and phosphate rock)
shows a slightly lower DCF than producing nitrophosphate (Cases 3 and 2). In
addition, producing the required wet-process phosphoric acid would need annual
foreign exchange expenditures of US$3.5 to $4 million for sulfur, which would
not be required in nitrophosphate manufacture.
Plant sizes must also be considered. In terms of other large
fertilizer installations already built and operating successfully in develop-
ing countries, the sizes of units indicated in Cases 1 and 5 are considered about
the maxima at the present time, especially as far as single-stream plants are
concerned. These are based on 910 tpd ammonia capacity, whereas the Dawood
Hercules plant which came on stream in November 1971 has only 620 tpd ammonia
unit. It is considered that building a 1,,200 tpd ammonia unit plus correspond-
ingly large downstream plants, as indicated in Cases 2, 3 and 4 would at this
time, expose the project to greatly increased financial risk and loss of product
because of urforeseen operating problems.
Because of the foregoing reasons, WPIDC and its consultants,
recommended the adoption of Case 1 as the basis for the project, and this was
accepted by ADB and IBRD.

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANQSION PROJECT
Dawood Hercules (DH) Project
Results to Date
Summary
The Bank and IFC helped to finance the DH project with US$32 nillion
loan and a US$2.9 million equity investment respectively (Report AA-4a dated
June 20, 1968). The plant, with a capacity of 341,000 tons of urea annuallyl/
is located near Lahore. Commercial operations began on schedule in Noveniber
1971 and DH produced 282,500 tons (82% capacity) in the fiscal year ended
October 31, 1972. Production in the year ended October 31, 1973 over 100%
capacity.
The actual cost of the project was US$84.6 million equivalent
compared with the appraisal estimate of US$78.2 million. The overrun was due
to increased customs duties and other governmental levies. The local currency
overrun was financed by short-term credits. The Bm k loan disbursements, as a
consequence of currency realignments were equivalent to US$35 million at
completion of the project.
ProfiCs for the year ended October 31 1973 were PRs 49 million
representing a return on share capital of 33%.2. If the share capital was
revalued to its original US$ equivalent, the return would be reduced to 17%.
Since October 1973, the company's distribution have been interrupted by a
change over in distribution from private agents to the Punjab government
agency which is now distributing 50% of DH's sales in the Province (88% of
total DH sales).
Pricing
The Company's ex-works price of PRs 648/ton was established in
September 1972 in conjunction with the new retail price of PRs 700 then set by
the government. DH was able to reduce its distribution margin from PRs 62/ton
to PRs 52/ton at that time because of transportation economies possible in the
Lahore area. The effective ex-works price received by DH's competitors in
higher than PRs 6h8/ton.
Financial Performance
The Company's first full year of operation, ending October 31, 1972
was adversely affected by the May 1952 rupee devaluation from PRs 4.76 = US$1.00
to PRs 11.0 = US$1.00. Price relief was not granted to DHT until September 1972.
At that time, the ex-works price was increased from PRs 508/ton to the present
level of PRs 6h8/ton. The Company reported a small profit of PRs 0.5 million
for FY 1972.
]/ 620 tons per day (tpd) of ammonia and 1,100 tpd of urea.
2/ DH has used accelerated depreciation to reduce taxes to zero for 1972
and 1973. The deferred taxes (PRs 20 million in 1973) are included in
equity but cannot be distributed.  If DR paid normal taxes (60%), the
return would be reduced from 33% to 13% on share capital.

Production Costs
The price of natural gas was increased in September 1973 by 22%,
a cost increase equivalent of PRs 17/ton of urea. Annual profits will be
reduced by PRs 6 million unless DH is permitted a compensating price increase.
The other manor operating cost item is bagging. DH uses cotton bags
with a polyethylene liner. The liner film is produced at the plant from
imported polyethylene beads. Cotton bags are locally purchased. In mid-
1972, the bagging cost to DH was PRs 54/ton. Price increases of cotton
raised this cost to PRs 76/ton by September 1973. Further cost increases
are expected and PRs 85/ton is the assumed future cost. Other production
costs shown below are in line with recent experience.

Mlanageraent
Although the Sponsors have equal equity positions, Hercules had
dominated the company through its right under the original Management
Agreement to select the General Manager. Dawood's position had been
weakened by the Government's cancellation of all Managing Agent agreements.
The sponsors have now reached a new agreement to share the manage-
ment responsibilities. The new management agreement was approved by the
DH Board of Directors in October 1973. Consistent with the agreement, the
former General Manager, John Eagan, has now assumed the post of Executive
Director. The new General Manager is Razak Dawood.
Distribution System
Distributors
Wnen DH began operations in November 1971, it initially divided
production equally between three distributors - Dawood Corporation (DCL),
Pakistan National Oil (PNO), and Jaffer Brothers. Subsequently, DH ad-
iusted the production allocation based on the ratio of actual sales during



ANNEX 1-3
Page 3
the first slack sales season. From April 1972 to September 1973, DCL received
43%, PNO 27% and Jaffer Brothers 30% of output. Since October 1973, 50% of
DH's production is sold in the Punjab through PASC.
Distribution Margin
The initial distribution margin given to distributors was PRs 70/
ton and DH product was distributed nationally. On July 1, 1972, fertilizer
distribution policy was made a provincial government responsibility. The
Punjab Government thereafter required DH to distribute 8&% of its output in
Punjab, with 12% allocated to North West Frontier Provinca. Because of
resulting lower transportation costs, DH reduced its margin to an average
PRs 62/ton. DH initiated a further margin cut to PRs 52/ton in September
1°72. PNO and Jaffer Brothers objected to reduced margins but the Govern-
ment upheld DH. Apparently, distributors benefit from low truck haulage
charges prevailing in Lahore, a net surplus area for empty trucks.
Private Dealers
Punjab has had 1,200 private dealers in 372 locations. The
locations nave been an average 25 miles apart and an estimated 90% of the
farmers live within 10 miles of a sales point. The average dealer has
been selling Loo tons of fertilizer per year. In taking over fertilizer
distribution, the Punjab Government claimed that the private sector had
made insufficient effort to distribute in rural areas. PASC plans to
establish 450 sales points.
Sales Terms
DH sells on a cash basis with daily invoicing and a three day pay-
ment lag. Plant receivables have been minimized by this procedure. PASC
has also agreed to pay on this basis. DH has provided an average distribu-
tion margin of PRs 52/ton by using a two-tier price system based on dealer
distance from the plant.

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
The Fauji Foundation Urea Project
Fauji Foundation is a non-profit charitable trust set up in 1953 and
operated by ex-military personnel. It is active in sugar, cotton, textiles and
food production.  It has received Government permission to set up an ammonia/
urea plant based on Mari natural gas at Goth Macchi in the Punjab Province,
about 40 km from the Sind/Punjab border. Initially it was intended for the
plant to be a virtual duplicate of the Dawood Hercules anmonia/urea plant near
Lahore (i.e. 620/1,l10 tpd) but a more economical larger sized plant of up to
1,000/1,700 tpd ammonia/urea is now being considered, provided the necessary
financing can be obtained. On the invitation of IFC, U.S. Steel has expressed
an interest, in principle, in making an investment ir the project and providing
technical and marketing assistance. Based on the market forecast detailed in
Annex 3-2,no urea oversupply should be created in Pakistan if Fauji were to build
the envisaged larger plant and commence production around 1977/78. In mid-1973
project costs were estimated at US$95.3 million including all offsites, financ-
ing charges and working capital for the (smaller) 1,100 tpd urea plant (the
similar D-H plant completed at the end of 1971 cost US$84.6 million).

FAKISTAN
MULJTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
SPONSORS AND MANAGEMET
A. WEST PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (WPIDC)
WPIDC, the owner until March 1974 (when its fertilizer business trans-
ferred to the newly created National Fertilizer Corporation) of tLa present
natural gas fertilizer facilitie- at Multan, is a government-owned and contrcKled
corporation established in 1962.1/ The main functions of WPIDC have been pro-'
motion of the economic and industrial develo-pment of Pakistan through operation
and management of completed projects and planning new schemes in accordance with
the targets laid down in the overall development plans of the country.  The
authorized share capital of the Corporation is PRs 10 million divided into 100
shares of PRs 100,000 each, of which 45 shares have been issued and subscribed
in full by the Government of Pakistan.
WPIDC has established and managed enterprises in various industries
including sugar, cement, fertilizers, chemicals, textiles and mining. As of
June 30, 1973, WPIDC had completed 59 industrial projects (including 33 projects
inherited from its predecessor, PIDC) at a capital cost of PRs 1,230.4 million.
Under the Government's August 1973 decision to reorganize the public
industrial sector with a view to making the sector more efficient,  WPIDC is
being restructured. Five new corporations have been set up to take over and
manage WPIDC projects in the fields of heavy engineering and machine tools,
fertilizers, cement, heavy electricals and chemicals. In fertilizers, the NFC
was established to take over WPIDC's share of Pak-,nerican Fertilizers Ltd. at
Daudkhel, the Multan Factory and Lyallpur Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd.
WPIDC had a total staff of 22,406 as of June 30, 1972, of whom 1,228
were at the head office at Karachi and the rest at branch offices and completed
plants throughout the country. As a result of reorganization tf WPIDC announced
in August 1973, some of the WPIDC staff are being reassigned to NFC.
B.  ABU DHABI NATIONAL OIL CORPORATION (ADNOC)
ADNOC was established in 1971 as an autonomous government company to
explore and exploit oil; search for natural gas; and refine, transport and sell
oil in Abu Dhabi and abroad. ADNOC's authorized capital is Bahraini Dinar 20
million to be provided by the Government and it is empowered to borrow up to
three times its capital. The Company is tax exempt and obliged to pay 55% of its
annual profits to the state. ADNOC's headquarters are in Abu Dhabi and it may
establish branches and agencies in other countries.
1/ Its predecessor, the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC),
was created in 1952 and divided in 1962 into WPIDC and the East Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation (EPIDC). Its successor in the fertilizer
business (NFC) is a GOP owned, private company with an authorized share capital
of PRs 1,000 million.  It was incorporated in August 1973 and WPIDC's ferti-
lizer business was transferred to NFC by order in March 1974.

PFL has selected Mr. A. U. _,oan to be Managing Director and Mr. Z.
A. Khan to be General Manager (Project) as shown in the attached organization
chart. The existing facilities will be managed by the General Manager (Plant)
Mr. Hafizullah under the direction of the Managing Director.NFC has the right to
appoint 8 board members and ADNOC 4. The initial Board of PFL is composed of
WPIDC and NFC executives, Government of Pakistan officers and representative of
ADNOC. Further appointments including outside directors are to be made. A
list of present Board members is attached. The Managing Director has been with
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. since 1967; most recently as the senior
technical officer. He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Punjab
University and has received training at institutions in the United States,
United Kingdom and Canada in Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering. Mr. Loan's
experience with IBRD projects and his familiarity with gas transmission should
be valuable to PFL. He is known to Bank staff and considered capable of
directing PFL's operations in concert with the consultants, technical advisors,
and engineering contractors.
The General Manager. (Project),Mr. Khan has 20 years experience with
WPIDC plants and will be responsible for site supervision of the Project. He is
a graduate engineer from the Punjab University and has received training and
visited plants in several European countries, the United States and Japan.
Mr. Khan's experience in construction and operation of WPIDC's plants and
familiarity with the Multan plant should complement Mr. Loan's exDerience.
Mr. Hafizullah's qualifications include degrees in engineering
from the Puniab University and training in France. He has been with WPIDC
for 20 years including over 10 years at Multan.
All three executives are in their mid-forties and have demonstrated
their abilities. With the assistance of outside project and management ad-
visers as provided as well as suitable departmental heads they appear to be
the nucleus of a satisfactory management team.

ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
The high cost of production has been overcome by artificial means and the
uncompetitive product (which is being remedied by ongoing investments) has
only been successful in the years 1970/71, 1971/72, and 1972/73. Due to
the lack of ammoni-, one of the two ammonia units being frequently out of
operation, the operating cost per ton was substantially higher than inter-
national levels.
The unfavorable situation in production was reflected in NGFF's
balance sheets and cash flow statements. T.le inventory reached the level of
more than a year's sales in 1970/71, and the average during the past six years
was eight months' sales. Accounts receivable were also at high levels,
reaching in 1969/70 to seven months aales and averaging about four months sales
for the past six years. These high levels of current assets kept the average
current ratio at a high level of W:1, reaching its highest of 7:1 in 1970/71.
Deficiencies in financial aspects derive from various reasons.  The
basic ideas applled in the financial management of NGUF were those of a
government agency, not of "commercial" corporations.

PAKISTAN
MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
The Agricultural Sector in Pakistan
1. Overview
Agriculture is the main industry in Pakistan and the largest single
contributor to the national income, accounting at present for about 38% of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 40% of export earnings. Including animal hus-
bandry and natural fibers, it also directly and indirectly provides work for
some 70% of the entire labor force. Current annual increases in population and
GDP of 2.8% and 5.8% respectively, plus a national policy to improve living
standards further emphasize the reliance of the country on an e#panding agricul-
tural sector.
During the mid-1950s, the provinces of Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan and
the North West Frontier (NWF)I/, changed from a food exportersto a food impor-
ters due to an increasing population and insufficient attention being given to
agriculture. More recently, substantial corrective measures were taken and
virtual self-sufficiency in food grains was achieved in 1969 and 1970. In fact,
0.5 million tons of grain (mostly high-grade rice) were exported in 1970/71.
In the period 1971/72 to 1972/73, wheat production rose by 9% to 7.4 million
tons and sugarcane output increased by 7.2% to 21.1 million tons. Rice produc-
tion declined slightly from 2.23 to 2.2 million tcns and cotton output fell by
0.8% to 3.95 million bales, largely due to the pest problems. However, in
August 1973, the agricultural sector suffered severe losses due to floods which
ruined about 600(,000     tons of stored wheat plus substantial quantities of
other commodities. Furthermore, these floods are likely to have adverse effects
on many 1973/74 crops. Consequently, large amounts of food grain imports will
be required during the next year or so, not only to replace these losses but
to make up deficiencies in domestic production, which amounted to 1.5 million
tons of imported wheat in 1972/73.
To achieve higher agricultural production, the Government has en-
deavored to increase the availability of major inputs such as water, fertili-
zers, better seeds and pesticides, farmer credits and education. The private
sector has also assisted in making available more fertilizers and other agri-
cultural needs. In the main farming areas, the country has extensive irriga-
tion systems, including 10,000 miles of canals and 100,000 tubewells. Out of
a total cultivated area of about 45 million acres, 33 million or 73% are
irrigated. Fertilizer use increased over tenfold in a decade, from 4l,000
nutrient tons in 1962/63 to 437,000 tons in 1972/73, while imports in 1972/73
were about 180,,000 nutrient tons or 41% of consumption. The Govermnent has
encouraged fertilizer use by heavy subsidies to farmers which have recently
increased considerably due to rising international fertilizer prices. Also,
the Government has supported a distribution program of high-yield seeds;



Annex 3-1
Page 2
consequently, areas under IRRI-PAK rice and MEXI-PAK wheat have increased
significantly in the last few years. Laznd reforms were announced in March 1972
to improve agricultural productivity and living standards of lower income far-
mers, whereby ceilings on individual ownership were reduced respectively from
1,000 and 500 acres of non-irrigated and irrigated land to 300 to 150 acres.
Holdings greater than these ceilings were distributed, without compensation,
among landless and below-subsistence cultivators. Some concessions to owners
of orchards, hunting lands and stud farms have also been withdrawn.
Another important factor in Pakistan agriculture is land utiliza-
tion. Out of a geographical total of nearly 200 million acres only some 23%
is cultivated and 20 to 22% of this acreage is left fallow. (However, about
10% of the cultivated acreage is cropped more than once). This low utiliza-
tion is mainly due to lack of rainfall and corresponding large barren areas.
Only a small region has more than 20 inches annually (the minimum needed to
sustain a wheat crop); consequently, more than 75% of the cultivated area
depends on irrigation. The major agricultural region is in the Province of
Punjab, which contains about 25 millfon cropped acres, equivalent to 659 of
the country's total. The province is highly irrigated and only 4 million
acres or 161 of its total cultivated area relies on rainfall. Major crops
include wheat, high-grade (Basmati) rice, cotton, maize and sugarcane. By
1979/80, Punjab cropped land is expected to increase by about 10% to 27.2
million acres, to give the following crop acreage pattern for the country:
Punjab        63.0%
Sind          25.21
NWFP          10.3%
Baluchistan    1.5%
100 .0%
2. Soil Conditions
Pakistan contains several mountain systems with intervening val-
leys and deserts, plus the alluvial plains of the Indus River System which
are by far the most important agricultural areas, particularly in the
Punjab. Soil properties vary widely in the country and thus influence fer-
tilizer application, as well as agricultural patterns. These differences
are briefly summarized below.
In the NWF Province, forest soils, sub-mountainous and valley-
plain types exist. In the forest areas of Hazara, soils are loamy, rich
in organic matter and fertile, unless overcropped. Sub-mountainous soils
vary from gravelly to sandy or clay loans, resulting from weathering of
underlying rocks. They are usually deficient in the major plant nutrients
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P205) and Potassium (K20). Valley-plain soils
vary from sandy loams to clay loams and in the Peshawar Valley they are
heavy textured due to fine silt. This region is fertile and the most im-
portant agricultural area in the Province.



Arirn;x s-1-
Page 3
The Punjab Province contsins the Himalayan region and sub-mountainous
tracts, plus the arid plateau of the Salt Range and the arid South-Western
Plains, as well as the eastem portion of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The most
important agricultural areas are the arid South Western and the Western Indo-
Gangetic plains. These soils are mostly alluvial deposits containing 10 to 15%
of clay, to a depth of 10 to 15 feet. They are usually alkaline and often
contaminated with sodium salts, as well as exchangeable sodium in the clay
complex. Consequently, large areas may remain barren until "sweetened" by
appropriate means.  These soils may also contain nodular calcium carbonate and
other calcareous minerals.
Sind soils are beyond the reach of the south-west and north-east
monsoons. Thus, since rainfall is sparse, sodium and calcium salts are abun-
dant and may be found as incrustations over large tracts of land or in barren
patches among cultivated areas. In general, therefore, Sind soils are alkaline.
Much of Baluchistan comprises tertiary rocks covered by little or
no soil or vegetation. Typical soil characteristics include high clay contents
plus appreciable quantities of sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and calcium
carbonate. Due to high summer temperatures, orgpnic matter is low and some
areas may be lateritic. Therefore, most Baluchistan soils give a low crop
response and the Province is only a minor contributor to Pakistan agriculture.
3. Water Supplies
Water is vital to efficient fertilizer use and crop growth. The
natural distribution pattern in Pakistan varies widely and has been greatly
modified by irrigation. Major sources are surface water, ground water and
rain, which ranges from none in some desert areas to 50 inches annually in
sub-mountainous districts such as Muree and Rawalpindi.
Precipitation in the Indus Plains ranges from 0 to 30inches annually,
the average being 7.5 inches. However, most rain occurs in July to September
and, except for a few but important winter showers in some areas, the remainder
of the year is dry. Irrigation is thus an increasing necessity for an expand-
ing agricultural sector. Dry farming is only undertaken in areas receiving
enough rain for specific crops and soils and usually in the Rabi (Winter)
reason when evaporation is low.
Main sources of surface waters in the Indus Valley are the six
rivers - Sutlej, Bias, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus. Except for the Bias,
all flow through Pakistan, with a total average run-off of 164.5 million
acre feet (maf). Historical usage in Pakistan is 83 maf and this is expec-
ted to rise to 112 maf when the Tarbela dam is commissioned, but this will
allow only 32 maf to flow to the sea in the monsoon months. It is anticipated
th.t this dam will not begin filling before 1974, nor become effective until
1976/77. A major factor for future development and extension of agriculture
in Pakistan is water storage in dams and subsequent higher irrigation rates
in winter months, rather than additional distribution networks. Therefore,
until the Tarbels basin is filled, additional crops grown in the Rabi season
(and ultimately dependent on this water source) will hsve to rely on fpvorable
winter rains.



PAge 3-1
Page 4
Water from the Indus Valley rivers is controlled and diverted by dams
and barrages into a complex system of irrigation canals feeding the dependent
agricultural areas, especially in the Punjab. Out of a total irrigated area
of some 33 million acres, about two-thirds are fed by canals. However, ground-
water under the irrigated areas of the Indus plains constitutes another large
source and at least 30 million acres of land are known to contain underground
water supplies. Experience has shown that large-capacity tubewells can be
constructed virtually at any location in the central Punjab and also in some
areas of the Sind. These underground reservoirs have been formed mainly by
seepage of irrigation water from canals fed by Indus Basin rivers. At present,
16% of irrigated land in Pakistan depends largely on tubewells fed by ground-
water sources. It has been estimated that near tubewells will supply an addi-
tional 2 maf each year during the next few years. Some of this water will go
to intensive cultivation and some to creating an additional half million acres
of farm land annually, to give a possible total cropped area of 43.1 million
acres by 1979/80.
4. Cropping Patterns and Practices
Pakistan has two cropping periods - the Kharif or summer season (April
through September) and the Rabi or winter period (October through March). The
usual cropping pattern is:
Kharif                   Rabi
Cotton                  Wheat
Rice                    Barley

Future National Cropping Patterns and Trends
Wheat acreage is expected to remain about constant, but increased
production is anticipated because of greater use of MEXI-PAK varieties
and more fertilizer. Any surplus would doubtless find ready export markets.
Increased rice acreage is planned, particularly in the Sind where more water
should be available, and the greater use of IRRI varieties plus heavier fer-
tilizer applications should increase the yield per acre appreciably. Some
additional sugarcane acreage is anticipated, together with greater yields
due to use of more fertilizer, and more milling capacity is planned. Cotton
acreage is expected to increase as this fiber is a major export and appreciably
more fodder wLll be needed to meet additional livestock requirements for food
and energy. In genernl, however, present overall crop patterns and rotation
systems are expected to continue, despite changes in acreages and improvements
in yields.
4- Agriculture in the Province of the Puni.ab
General: The location of the proposed fertilizer plant expansion
project is at Multan, a city almost in the center of the Punjab Province which
contains 63% of the entire cropped acreage of the country. Punjab is there-
fore the principal marketing area of the Multan plant and additional agricul-
tural details of this Province will be appropriate.
Water Supplies: From a farming viewpoint, the Punjab can be divided
into two main sections. One is the Potwar Plateau (and adjoining areas above
the Indus River Plain and its tributaries) where crops are largely rain-fed
(barani). The other is the main plains of the Indus and Punjab rivers where,
except for the small Sialkot area in the north-east, crops are mostly fed by
irrigation canals branching from the principal rivers, or by tubewells. As
shown in the following table, the irrigated areas predominate and are mostly
south of the Salt Range. About 69% of this acreage is fed by Government canals,
13% by tubewells and 9% by other wells; the remainder being supplemented by
private canals and miscellaneous sources. Out of a total of nearly 27 million
cultivated acres, the areas relying on rain are only about 6 million acres,
or 23% of the total; the remaining 77% being irrigated.

The largest concentration of irrigated acreage is between the Chenab
and Sutlej rivers, on both sides of the Ravi river. The major agricultural
area is in the Multan and Sahiwal Districts in the Multan division, plus the
nearby Lyallpur District in the Sargodha division. These three districts
account for 7.6 million acres or 37% of the irrigated areas in the Province.
If the irrigated regions to the south in Bahawalpur and to the west in
Muzaffargahi are included, these represent an increase of 4.7 million acres,
to give a total irrigated area of 12.3 million acres or nearly 60% of the
irrigated regions in the Province. Therefore, the existing fertilizer plants
at Multan, Lyallpur (and nearby Jaranwala) are strategically located in terms
of major markets and minimum distribution distances to rain-fed areas, mostly
in the north.
Land Utilization: Because of climatic changes, double-cropping and
other reasons, land utilization varies slightly from year to year. A typical
recent pattern is given in Table 4.7.

1/   Includes areas cropped more than once annually.
Soil Conditions: Punjab soils, south of the Salt Range, are sandy
loams and usually alkaline. Total soluble salts in areas under cultivation
are typically between 1,500 to 5,000 parts per million (ppm) in concentration,
but this can rise to 10,000 ppm in highly saline areas such as Isa Khel. Con-
sequently, prior or periodic leaching and other soil treatment become neces-
sary in such locations before farming can be undertaken. North of Salt Range,
the alkalinity is relatively low (7.4 to 7,5 pH) due to leaching by rainfall.
In the canal fed areas, higher alkanities are found, between pH 7.6 to 8.2
and typically in the pH 7.8 to 8.0 range.
Organic matter is usually low - about 1% or less - and is as little
as 0.3% in the Potwar plateau because of the prevailing arid conditions. In
the mountainous and wooded Murree area, soil organic contents may reach 4%.



Annex 3-1
'Pae 11
Soil textures vary greatly, as they are usually heavier and higher in clay
content when near rivers and more sandy elsewhere. Phosphorus contents are
low (3 to 5 ppm) in rain-fed areas due to gradual leaching, and may vary
between 5 to 12 ppm in canal-fed areas. The prevalence of low organic and
phosphorus contents in many districts and "tehsils" or sub-districts, as
shown in Table 4.9 indicates the need for supplental plant nutrients and
also organic matter.
Cropping Pattern: Major crops are wheat, rice, cotton, maize and
sugarcane. These account for nearly 18 million acres or 67% of the total
cropped area.  The distribution pattern is given for 1970/71 in Table L,.8:

PAKISTAN
MULTAN FERTIL!n!ZM   ANSION PROJECT
THE FETILIZER INDUSTRY IN PARISTAN
1. Overview
As indicated in Annex 3-1, many soils of Pakistan are alkaline
and low in organic and phosphorus content. Agriculture is largely restricted
to areas irrigated by canals or wells fed by the main rivers and is therefore
intensive. As timber for fuel has been scarce, organic materials such as
animal manure, straw, brush, etc., has been burned over the centuries and not
returned to the land. Consequently, a gradual need has arisen to add in-
creasing amounts of fertilizer chemicals to cultivated soils. This need is
now intensifying as newer, high-yield crop varieties, plus a rapidly expanding
population and increasing export markets, make continually greater demands
on limited agricultural areas. Fortunately, in most of these areas, supplies
of water, labor and sunlight are sufficient to ensure a substantial economic
response to correctly formulated and properly applied fertilizers.
An acute food shortage in the early 1950's prompted the first
importation of fertilizer, and consumption grew slowly until 1957, when small
single superphosphate plants at Lyallpur and Jaranwala plus an ammonium
sulfate plant at Daudkhel were built by the Government. These were followed
by another Government plant at Multan in 1961/62 for producing calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN) and urea, an Esso Ltd. urea plant at Daharki in 1968 and a
Dawood-Hercules Ltd. urea plant near Lahore in 1971. However, as the following
tables show, consuwption has increasingly exceeded domestic production requiring
in turn, progressively greater imports. Present-and near-future import require-
ments are large enough to justify constructing more large domestic fertilizer
plants, not only to produce nitrogen compounds but phosphate fertilizers as
well, with proviEions for including potassium and other essential plant food
elements, as required, by specific soils and crops.
Conpared to established fertilizer plant nutrient ratios in many
other countries, addition of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in relation to
nitrogen (N) have been, and are, low. There are several reasons for this,
such as a much greater intial response to N than to P and K and a correspon-
ding preference by farmers for N fertilizers, plus a reliance on residual P
and K in soils, especially those in alluvial areas near the main rivers.
However, increased planting of high-yield wheat, rice and other
crops leads to greater removal of plant nutrients from the soil compared to
traditional varieties and it is generally recognized that P and K applications
will have to increase, in both total annual amounts and in relation to the
annual amounts of N consumed in the country. Nevertheless, agreement by agron-
omists on precise current and projected relative needs for N, P and K in Paki-
stan has not yet been reached. Trend patterns in other countries with longer
experience in fertilizer application give some guidance and suggest the planning
and provision for additional domestic phosphate fertilizer production to be
prudent. Accordingly, the Multan project is designed to produce, in addition
to CAN, a compound fertilizer (nitrophosphate) containing phosphatosequivalent
to 70,000 tons per year of P205. These phosphates will be in a highly water -

soluble form (about 80%, mostly as ammonium phosphate) to give maximum
effec1tiveness in alkaline soils. Other phosphate projecta are also under
consideration in Pakistan to meet enviBaged future needs.  Meanwhile, the
Multan project will help to meet a recognised gap in domestic fertilizer
production.

Growth in Nutrient Consumption
To summarize, past consumption of nitrogen fertilizer in terms
of N has increased nearly tenfold in the last decade to a current level
approaching 400,000 tons annually. About two-thirds of this amount is now
met by domestic production and the remainder by imports. Phosphate fertil-
izer consumption simultaneously rose from a few hundred tons to the latest
estimated figure of about 510,000 tons annually, of which about 16% was
produced domestically. Potassium fertilizer use during the same period
increased from virtually nil to about 2,50o tons in 1968/69, but has since
declined to below 1,000 tons annually and virtually all has been imported.
Because of the very low consumption levels in the6Rrly -ears, it is more
realistic to measure annual percentage growths in consumption over the last
five years for which actual data are available (1967/68 to 1971/72). Corres-
ponding annual growths are given in the following table:

1/ Estimated.
Annual growth rates for N are seen to be positive although erratic,
due to hostilities and other reasons. Annual increases in phosphate con-
sumption ceased between 1968 and 1971, but have subsequently risen substan-
tially, while use of potassium salts have declined from low tonnages in 1967/68
to even smaller current levels.
Nutrient Ratios
These have varied widely in recent years, due to availability and
other reasons. During the latest year for which actual data are available
(1971/72), the ratio of N:Pc05: .K20 for  Pakistan was about 9:1:0.02.  In
many developed and developing countries, the overall actual or target ratios
are of the order of 2:1:0.5. This indicates a likely future need for much
greater actual and relative amounts of phosphate and potassium fertilizers
than is given by simple projections of past consumption of these nutrients.
In recent years, N to P205 ratios used on the major crops were:

AlthOugh these ratios denote severe P205 application deficiencies compared
to many other countries, they are better for Wheat than for sugarcane,
cotton and rice.
Product Trenda
During the last decade, major trends have occurred in product use,
as shown in the table below:

I/ Estimated, based on domestic production plus imports.
The predominant trend towards urea as a nitrogen fertilizer is
evident. The switch to diammonium phosphate as a major phosphate source in
1972/73 is temporary, as this is intended to function as a water-soluble
P205 "seedingt' product for nitrophosphates to be made later at Multan.
Seasonal Fertiliser Application Patterns
Nitrogen
Peak consumption months for nitrogen fertilizers are December and
January, with actual use during this peziod (Rabi) extending from about mid-
October to mid-February.  During the last five years, between 36% and 40% of
all nitrogen fertilizers consumed in Pakistan were applied during these four
months, largely on wheat. The months May through October



ANNEX 3-2
Page 8
represent another high N application period (Karif) especiallv on
sugarcane, cotton and rice.  In the last five years, between 34 and 40% of
all N used was applied during these months.
Phosphates
October to December are the most active  months for phosphate
application (especially November).  This is largely due to heavy seed-bed
preparation for the forthcoming wheat crop. Although recent phosphate con-
sumption has been erratic due to restricted availability and other reasons,
between 40% and 70%  of all P2C5used during the last few years has been
applied in these months. The balance was largely used during April and June
on sugarcane, cotton and rice.
World Comparisons of Nitrogen Fertilizer Consumption
Wide variations in the consumption of fertilizers are found
throughout the world, according to the availability of land, water, raw
materials and other farm inputs, as well as inherent soil fertility, agri-
cultural practices and cropping patterns. A recent comparison is given
below:

It can be seen there is ample scope for increased fertilizer use in Pakistan,
not only in terms of N but, as already indicated, larelative and  actual
greater amounts of P205 and K20 . Corresponding N:P20: K20 ratios for culti-
vated land are given in the following table:

NOTE: Differences in application ratios in kg per hectare and corresponding
nutrient ratios reported by various sources sometimes arise due to double-
cropping and the practice of leaving some land in fallow, especially in some
sub-tropical and tropical countries. Thus, it may be difficult to distinguish
between "cultivated" land and "arable" or "cropped land". The above compari-
sons are made on a reported arable land basis to the extent discernable.
3. Fertilizer Use in the Punjab
As indicated in Annex 3-1, the Province of Punjab represents some
65% of the country's cropped acreage and produces over 70% of its major crops.
Since the Multan expansion project will be undertaken in the heart of the
Punjab agricultural sector, it is relevant to examine the Punjab fertilizer
paLI'tenr in some detail.
Table 3.1 shows the comparative consumption of nitrogen fertilzier
by Province, tonnage and percentage from 1965/66 to 1971/72. It indicates a
450% increase in tonnage, even though this represents a fall from 74% to 66%
of the total Pakistan annual consumption. Tables 3.2 and 3.3 show similar
patterns for phosphates and potash, even though yearly consumptions are erratic.

Overall fertilizer sales in recent years have comprised 65 to 70%
in the Punjab, 20 to 25% in the Sind plue about 10% in the North West Frontier
Province and very small amounts in Baluchistan. Potassium fertilizer sales
have largely been limited to tobacco in the Punjab and the Sind. Sales of
fertilizer nutrients in the Punjab, expressed in tons and also percentages of
total Pakistan sales during recent years are retabulated below, for convenience:

ANNEX 3-2
Pa ge 15-
Table 3.5 shows that the areas around the Multan plant, i.e.
Bahawalpur, Bahawal Nagar and Rahinyar Khan, plus the Multan Sahiwal and
Lyallpur Districts accounted for over 106,000 nutrient tons of N in 1970/71
or 61% of sales in  the Province, and about 147,000 tons of N in 1971/72 or
64% of provincial sales in 1971/72. Corresponding phosphate sales were
11,450 and 16,200 nutrient tons of P205, representing 60% and 64% of total
sales in the Province.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that the existing Multan plant and proposed
expansion project are very well located as regards fertilizer sales to local
districts plus the rest of the Punjab - and also adjoining territories in the
North West Frontier Province and the Sind, should temporary surpluses ever
have to be sold in other Provinces, which seems unlikely.
Crop Responses to Different Fertilizers
Traditional fertilizers in Pakistan have been ammonium sulfate,
calcium amonium nitrate and single superphosphate. Nbre recently, urea
has become the major nitrogen fertilizer and additional phosphate supplies
in the form of diasnonium phosphate and nitrophosphate are now being intro-
duced (see Table 2.6). Because most Pakistan soils are alkaline, ammonium
sulfate and highly waterTsoluble phosphates are logical choices, as confirmed
by trials and experience.  However, the extra price of amonium sulfate on a
delivered-to-farm N basis compared to urea or ammonium nitrate has not been
found justifiable by the slightly higher yield per unit of N.
Numerous experiments by Pakistani and international agronomists
indicate all highly water-soluble phosphate fertilizers such as superphosphates,
diammonium phosphates and modern nitrophosphates (which are mainly combinations
of ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrate) have shown similar results on
wheat - the largest crop using phosphate. In the Punjab, highly water-soluble
1:1 nitrophosphates have given the best results, compared to other sources of
P205,probably because young wheat plants thrive on a basic 1:1 N to P205 ratio
and absorb these nutrients at simultaneous rates. (Subsequent top dressing
is with urea, or ammonium nitrate as CAN).
The results of some recent trials, made under the FA0/Government
of Pakistan Soil Fertility Program, 1969/71, and other programs are given in

In the 70 trials made on each combination listed in Table 3.6,
it can be seen the highest increase in yield was obtained with a nitro-
phosphate-urea mixture, and the lowest yield was when dicalcium phosphate
was used. In view of DCP's low solubility in alkaline conditions, this is
to be expected.
One surprising feature of these trials was that in the Lahore
District, much better yield increases resulted from each treatment when canal
water was used instead of tubewall water - the average yield for all treat-
ments being 54% higher.  Conversely, in the Sargodha District, tubewell water
gave 22% better average yields than when canal water was used. Differences
between using canal water in Bahawalpur and tubewell water in Rawalpindi
amounted to a 36% greater average yield in favor of canal water for the same
treatments. These unexpected influences of water sources on crop yields are
being further studied and may be due to differences in soluble phosphates or
micro-nutrients in the water used for irrigation, plus the influcence of mineral
ion-exchange and associated soil chemistry.

Potassium Fertilizers
While it is generally considered that there is no shortage of
potassium minerals at present in Pakistan soils, trials in some areas have
indicated yields can be substantially improved by K20 additions. One typical
example is given below for the Punjab wheat.

Experimental work is thus needed to prevent intensively cropped areas from
becoming depleted in potasslum. Similar safeguards must be applied to prevent
deficiencies in micro-nutrients such as zinc, sulfur, iron, co?per, etc. from
arising.

4. Projected Fertilizer Demand, Production and Imports
Numerous projections of fertilizer demand and supply have been
made for Pakistan by domestic and international specialists, and their
estimates vary widely. Some have been based on historical data which are
erratic in Towth because of factors unrelated to demand, e.g. hostilities,
weather or foreign exchange availability and the forecasts may be low.
Others have been baEsed on recommended crop dosages or calorie requirements
per capita and have been too high. Accordingly, only those projections
believed to be of the most reaListic nature will be briefly examined and
corresponding conclusions drawn.
Constraints
Water Availability
The majority of farmers are totally dependent on irrigation facili-
ties, or uncertain and limited rainfall Which discourages risking outlays
for fertilizer on crops that may largely fail. Even in irrigated areas water
suppiies xay vary from year to year, because of fluctuations in mountain snow-
falls; during the early months of 1970 and 1971 river levels were the lowest
in 100 years. (However, completion of the Tarbela Dam will help to provide
more regular annual irrigation).   Consequently, farmers have tended to reduce
risks of financial loss by limiting investments in fertilizers. Even many
larger farms do not use more than 60 lbs/cre of N and 10 lbs or so
or P205, compared to recommended applications of 120 lbs and 60 lbs, respec-
tively, on high-yield wheat.
Credit Availability
Whereas many large and medium sized farms are able to pSy cash
or obtain short-term loans without difficulty, milLions of small and subsis-
tence farms have had no access to credit on favorable terms. On the assumD-
tion that small farms make up about one-third of the agricultural compor.ent
of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product), and that these would respond rapidly to
realistic credit availability, it is estimated their annual needs would amount
to about Rs 5,000 million (US$500 million approximately).
Present farm credit availability is only one-tenth of this sum. Hence, lack
of credit facilities must be considered a major constraint that needs amelior-
ating at once.  Of course, only part of this sum wolId be required for fertil-
izer purchases but these would be ineffective without simultaneously providing
credit for other related farm inputs.
Product Availability
In the past, lack of fertilizer availability due to foreign exchange
restrictions and limited local production has placed severe limits on unhampered
market growth. In the next few years international supply/demand imbalances
will adversely affect consumption.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 20
Crop Prices
Large and medium sized farmers producing cash crops, will not
strive for greater outputs and use corresponding additional fertilizer,
unless crop prices justify the extra risk and effort. Consequently, these
price levels must bear a profitable ratio to the cost of fertilizer and
other inputs. However, the Government is acutely aware of the political
overtones induced by increases in crop prices and avoids them to the extent
possible. As a result, agricultural expansion and increased fertilizer use
are gradually retarded until new crop prices are authorited.
Farmer Education
Ignorance of, and resistance to, fertilizer use is eiminishing
due to the spread of education and demonstration campaigns by public and
private sector producers and distributors.  However, much promotional work
rsmaina to be dDne, particularly in the poorer rural areas and increased
emphasis on regular use of recommended dosages will be necessary as more
fertilizer, especially phosphate, becomes available.
Demand Projections by Sburce and Basis
Edwards has made the following projections according to the
basis and assumptions given below:
Basis:  Indicated crop.increases and modified recommended
app_ication rates
Iteat:  Recent annual growth rates of 15% in the use of high
yield varieties (HIV) will continue, and all irrigated
-heat areas (nearly 12 million acres) plus 4 million
rain-fed (barani) acres will be planted to HYV by 1974/75.
Rice:   The whole irrigated area of 4 million acres will be
planted to HYV Basmati seed by 1974/75.
Cotton: Higher prices and increased exports plus more pesticide
availability will encourage raising planted acrease to
5 million by about 1975.
Other   Crop yields and fertilizer  ses similar to those for
Cropss  wheat, rice and cotton will result on sugarca;-ie, maize,
oilseeds, fruit, fodder, etc., which represent 20% of
current fertilizer demand.
Recommended Rates
Typical recommended application rates for the major crops are 68 lbs
N and 53 lbs E2(5 per acre applied as a basal (seed) dressing in the form of
DAP or NP or SSP, plus CAN or urea. This is followed by a top dressing of 100
lbs N as urea or CAN, to give a total N:P205 ratio of 3.2:l.

Modified Recommended Rates
In many countries and for most crops, 67 to 75% of the maximum
economic return can be achieved by using 50% of recommended N dosages.
Accordingly, Edwards adopts much lower relative rates for N and also lower
average rates for N plus P205 , to give the following projected modified
needs:

Because of lack of availability, however, it is unlikely even these reduced

(N:P205- 6.2:1)
Regarding N:P205 ratios, Edwards stresses that every effort must
be made to reduce the present high figures to an average not greater than
4:1 and, if possible, 3:1; otherwise, yields of high-yielding variety crops
will soon become seriously retarded.  For example, in 1970 and 1971, these
ratios for wheat were 13:1 and 7.1:1 while for sugarcane, cotton and rice they
ranged from 20:1 to 13:1. The effect of nitrogen application-rate levels on
phosphate intake must also be considered. Recent Esso Pakistan Fertilizer
Ltd. trials have shown that use of phosphates, and in turn, additional N, on
high-yield varieties of Wheat are only economic when niltrogen dosaige is more
than 60 to 65 lbs N per acre. It is likely that responses of other crops are
similar, thus emphasizing the essential need for much greater phosphate use,
to maximize the benefits of adding both nutrients. In many cases, use of N
on MexiPak Wheat in Pakistan is now in the range of 40 to 45 lbs/acre.
Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Ltd. and the Agricultural Development
Corporation have made projections of land use and fertilized acreages, as well
as estimates of typical crop nitrogen dosages for 1979/80. By this time,
greater fertilizer availability and reduced application constraints due to



ANNEX 3-2
Page 22
cited reasons can be anticipated. Moreover, to  make economic use of the
high-yielding varieties of the major crops - wheat, rice and cotton - it
will be essential to use the minimun recommended dosages and an average
4.1 N:P205 nutrient ratio as advocated by Edwards. Combining these projected
land-use and fertilizer-use patterns for 1979/80 and allowing a conservative
5% overall increase for 1980/81 gives the following demand estimate:

Thus, the envisaged demand for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
(P205) fertilizer nutrients by 1980/81 are seen on the above basis as about
875,000 tons and 220,000 tons respectively, assuming a minimum target ratio
of 4:1 for N: P205 is achieved.  By this time, some potassium fertilizer
may also be needed and could amount to at least 25% of phosphate needs, or
55,000 tons per year of equivalent K20.
5. Past, Present and Projected Domestic Fertilizer Production
Past and Present Installed Capacity
Phosphate: Fertilizer production in Pakistan commenced in 1957
when a smalflr 1tp-dsulfuric acid plant at Lyallpur was complemented by a
60 tpd (3,240 tpy P205) single superphosphate (SSP) unit. As phosphate
fertilizer demand slowly increased, WPIDC expanded production by enlarging
the 4yallpur unit to about 18,000 tpy and building another 100,000 tpy
capacity at Jaranwala, 22 miles away. Thus, combined P205 capacity of
0-18-0 SSP would be 118,000 tpy or 20,000 tpy N, providing sulfuric acid
supplies were sufficient.
However, SSP production and consumption in recent years has been
only in the 4,000 to 5,000 ton range, due to much of the available sulfuric
acid being used for other purposes and also, product acceptance.  Discussions
with several farmers have indicated there is little reluctance to use SSP
per se, but they showed a distaste for handling the WPIDC product. This is
because it is bagged in a powdered, semi-cured form and often ar-rives at
the farm in lumpy masses which have to be manually pulverized before use.
Also, even when powdered, the material cannot be spread mechanically on the
larger farms. Production of a well-cured granular product by simple mechan-
ical means (as discussed with plant management) would do much to improve
quality and farmer acceptance. Jordan rock has been consistly used in these
plants and sulfur is currently imported from Poland.
Nitrogen:  In 1957/58, an ammonium sulfate plant of 50,000 tp;
product capac'iy supplied under USAID, came on-stream at Daudkhel in mianwali
District. Initially, it was based on producing 40 tpd of ammonia plus bV-
product carbon dioxide from nearby coal-deposits and using these gases to
convert local gypsum to ammonium sulfate. In 1965, the plant was expanded and
an additional 36 tpd of ammonia produced to yield a further 45,000 tpy of
sulfate. Recently, natural gas has become available via a Sui Northern Pipe-
line from Dhulian and, by 1974, all production should be based on natural gas
instead of coal. Part of the ammonia output in the last ten years has been
used for refrigeration and defense purposes and this, together with plant
modifications plus fuel and other problems, has restricted annual sulfate out-
put in recent yearsto 60,000 tons or so. The plants are old but well-maintained
and when fully on natural gas should be capable of achieving outputs of 90,000
tpy ammonium sulfate (say 19,000 tpy of N).



ANNEX 3-2
Page 24
In 1963, a crystalline urea plus calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
plant, supplied under tied French aid, was started up by WPIDC at Multan
based on Sui natural gas. Plant capacities were 200 tpd ammonia (2 streams)
plus 1W0 tpd (57,000 tpy) urea and 300 tpd (99,000 tpy) CAN using limestone
as a filler to give a 26.6% N product.
The ammonia units have never consistently achieved design capaci-
ties and in 1968, an "Ammonopac" 60 tpd packaged ammonia plant was installed
to remec4 the deficiency but thie, too, has never operated properly. In
1965/66, for example, 41,000 tons of urea and 79,500 tons of CAN were produced,
representing 71% of design production, while in 1971/72, corresponding outputs
were 27,300 and 76,000 tons or 61% of design capacity. While the granular
CAN product is liked by farmers, the crystalline bagged urea now made hardens
into "tombstones" and is often rejected as unusable, despite acute shortages
of N fertilizers.  ( A prilling tower is under construction to remedy this
problem ).
In 1968, Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Ltd. brought on-stream a prilled
urea plant at Daharki in the SLnd based on MaNri natural gas, with an output
of 300 tons ammonia or 515 tpd (170,000 tpy) or urea equivalent to 72,000 tons
of N annually. At times, the plant has demonstrated urea capacities 115%
of design rating, i.e. 83,000 tpy and output haa consistently been high. In
1971, Dawood-Hercules brought into opetration a 345,000 tpy prilled urea plant
(155,000 tpy N) at Chichoki-Mallian, 16 miles from Lahore, based on Sui gas.
Apart from interruptions due to hostilities and one or two mechanical failures,
this plant has demonstrated an ability to operate consistently 10% above
design rating and, like Esco's urea, the product has won ready acceptance by
farmers.
Historical production of fertilizer in Pakistan by source, type
and nutrient total is given in Table 2.2. and is reproduced here for conveniences

Projected Capacity - Expanded and New Plants
Phosphate
As Single Superphosphate:  The two S5P plants at Lyallpur and
Jaranvala should together produce about 108,000 tpy (19,500 tpy P205) if
operated on a three-shift basis and supplied with sufficient sulfuric acid.
Latest plans call for using all of the 20 tpd sulfuric acid at Lyallpur to
make SSP and expanded acid production at Jaranwala from 50 to 100 tpd. This
would produce about 300 tpd or 90,000 tpy SSP (16,000 tpy P20 ) assuming
100 tpd of acid were consumed and 20 tpd were sold. Alternatively, a new
100 tpd sulfuric acid plant might be installed at Jaranwala. 'This would
enable 360 tpd of super to be made in both plants (108,000 tpy product or
19,500 tpy P205), and still leave 50 tpd of sulfuric acid for sale.  In view
of the forthcoming expansion at Multan, however, construction of the smaller
acid plant, to give a total production of about 90,000 tpy SET or 16,000 tpy
P205 is currently favored. This seems surprising as sulfuric acid is increas-
ingly needed in most developing countries, not only for phosphate fertilizer
production but for many industrial purposes.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 26
As Nitrophosphate:  The Multan expansion project described in
this appraisal is based on producing 70,000 tPY Of P205 plus 70,000 tpy N
as a nitrophosphate (NP) containing 22.5% P2C5 and 22.5% N, together with
90,000 tpy of N as calcium ammonium nitrate CAN.
As Other Phosphate Products (Monoammonium Phosphate ( W ) and
MAP Urea Mixtures): In 1968, a company known as Pakistan Fertilizers Ltd.
sponsored by Jaffer Brothers Ltd., placed pro-forua orders idi Pintach
Bamag A. G. (Federal Republic of Germany) for a plant to produce triple
superphosphate (TSP) at Karachi based on imported phosphate rock and sulfur
with a capacity of 150,000 t py (70,000 tpy P205).  This contractor became
bankrupt and a new contract was placed with Mannesman Exports (also Federal
Republic of Germany) but to make monoammonium phosphate (MAP) instead of
TSP, using imported ammonia and phosphoric acid during the first five years.
The MAP would be combined with domestic urea to a granular 28-28-0 product
known as UAP (urea ammonium phosphate) developed by Tennessee Valley Authority
of USA. Permission to proceed was granted by GOP in November 1970 to Jaffer
Bros. who acquired land and assembled a project team but further work ceased
when management control was taken over by the Government under the Economic
Reforms Order in February 1972. This project (Pakferco) was to be aided by
a PICIC loan of about US$2 million, which is still valid.
In mid-1973, the Government again approved the project and following
new tendering, SLnon Carves Ltd. of the UK was awarded the contract by the
now-Government controlled Pakistan Fertilizer Company Limited, for a MAP plant
having an output of about 140,000 tpy (equivalent to 13,000 tpy N and 50,000
tpy P205). The product would be blended by Pakferco and/or others with urea
to produce UAP. Estimated total cost is PRs 100 million or about US$10 million
However, as regular supplies of imported ammonia, phosphoric acid and even
MAP are very scarce and unlikely to be available for several years, the via-
bility of this import-based project appears questionable at this time. The
use of wet-process phosphoric acid to be made at the envisaged Sarhad project
in the North West Frontier Province (described below) has been suggested, but
this availability is also unlikely for several years, if at all. Another
suggestion, if the Sarhad project materializes, is to move the Pakferco MAP
project to Sarhad and ship the product to urea plants in the Punjab and the
Sind to make granular UAP.
Phosphates Made from Ijdgenous Phosphate Rock
Existence of large alluvial tracts is Pakistan have led to specu-
lation that commercial phosphate deposits may exist in the country, possibly
in the Salt Range and Potwar Plateau regions. Surprisingly, in 1969, some
hard blue apatite rock was discovered near Abbottabad in the Hazara District,
North West Frontier Province.  Subsequent exploration in this province has
revealed numerous phosphate deposits, albeit not large ones compared to those
in USA or North Africa, but big enough to be worth considering as commercially
significant for Pakistan.  Some are fairly pure, high grade apatite, which
would need little treatment, apart from grinding, to be used in phosphoric
acid or superphosphate production. Others are low-grade ores contaminated
with dolomite and would require beneficiation before use. The summary of
proven and likely deposits in the Abbottabad-Tarbela-Peshawar region is given
below:

Total                 739                                     1T70
Although apatite outcrops in amall quantities near Abbottabad,
many of the other deposits lie at depths of 200 to 500 feet. Of the proven
reserves, about 1.7 million tons averaging 30% P205 and easily upgradeable
to 32/3h% are available. These could feed a plant of 80,000 tpy P205
capacity for 6 years or a 90,000 tpy  P205 installation for 5½ years, allowing
for processing and handling losses. Afterwards, proven lower-grade deposits
would have to be mined and beneficiated before use and might feed a 90,000
tpy plant for 6 years or so. Possible additional reserves identified to date,
with an assumed average P205 content of 20%, might supply a 90,000 tpy plant
for an additional 35 years.  However, mining and beneficiation costs could be
high since many deposits are scattered and lie at depths from 300 to 500 feet
in dolomitic beds.  Also, as with Rajasthan rock in India, known methods of
easily separating associated dolomite have not yet been commercially developed,
apart from one specific case in Brazil.
Estimates of mining costs for the better and more accessible deposits
vary considerably, but are reported to indicate a probable averaEe ex-mine
price of about Rs 70 (US$7 per ton). Transportation cost-estimates also cover
a wide range but are expected to average about Rs 80 to give a delivered price
to a proposed plant site at Tarbela of about Rs 15C  (US$15) per ton
Therefore, the possibilities of using these domestic phosphate deposits are
appealing, especially as cif prices are over US$h0 per ton.
The extent of proven reserves may be too
small to justify building at Tarbela a phosphate complex consisting of sulfuric
acid, phosphoric acid and diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate
(TSP) units, having a P205 equivalent output of about 300 tpd or 90,000 tpy,
as proposed by the Sarhad Development Authority.  Also, a later switch to
imported rock would involve high transportation costs from Karachi to Tarbela
in the NWFP. An alternative would be to use domestic rock to
the extent possible in the Lyallpur and Jaranwala single super plants and the
Multan nitrophosphate plant - unless substantially bigger reserves are discov-
ered. At design capacities, these fertilizer plants would together consume
about 90,000 tb1 of P205, equivalent to the needs of the envisaged phosphate
complex at Tarbela.  This would avoid risking about US$15 million in capital
outlay at Tarbela or the alternative possibility of having to pay high rock
transportation costs from Karachi to Tarbela, should domestic reserves prove
insufficient or unsuitable.

Therefore, domestic phosphate producti n projections made at
this time -will assume that production equivalent to the plant sactioned by the
the Government  at Karachi, will go ahead and will gradually
produce up to ±3,000 tpy of N and 50,000 tpy of P205 annually as 148.,000
tpy of MAP from 1977 onward, when sufficient phosphoric acid (and ammonia
if necessary)may be available from Mexico, North Africa or U.S.A. Projected
domestic phosphate production on the above assumptions would therefore bes

Note 1: If NWFP phosphate rock proves to be commercially viable, it
is unlikely significant quantities could be made available before 1976/77,
bearing in mind the appreciable mining, transportation and later beneficiation
problems to be overcome. Possibly, 100,000, 200,000 and 300,000 tpy might be
produced and used from 1976/77 onwards. This vould yield substantial savings
in foreign exchange, especially on imported rock prices in the anticipated
US$40 per ton cif range.
Note 2:  Based on anticipated increases in crop dosages shown in Table 4.3;
the corresponding average annual increase in P205 consumption for the period
shown is about 21%.
Note 3: Although the above production figures include 25,000 tons, 33,000 tons
and 45,000 tons P20s for the last 3 years, these represent MAP made from
imported phosphoric acid.
It can be concluded from Table 5.3 and Figure 5.1 that by 1980/81
a wet-process phosphoric acid plant with a capacity of at least 150,000 tpy
or 500 tpd P20< , say, to supply Pakferco and the projected P205 shortage
appears justified.
Mari Gas, Urea Project
A plan to build a 600,000 tpy urea plant in the Sind, operating
on Mari gas, with at least 200,000 tpy comnitted to export sales has been
sanctioned by the Government. This proposed project has encountered financing
problems and it therefore has not been included in the following nitrogen
produaction projections.

Note lt  The projected growth, based on anticipated increases in crop dosages
shown i!n Table 4.3, correspond to an average yearly increased of 11% for the
period shown.
Note 2: If MAP were to be made at Karachi by Pakferco, using imported ammonia,
the equivalent of N needed would be part of the differences shown above for
the last three years. If made from domestic ammonia, the N shortages shown
above would be the same, as some MAP would be substituted for domestic urea
on an equivalent N basis.
It can be concluded from Table 5.5 and Figure 5.2 that, even with
a large Fauji urea plant (910 tpd ammonia and 530,000 tpy urea) on-stream
at 90% of rated capacity, together with the Multan project and existing fer-
tilizer plants, no excess domestic production should arise - based on the
anticipated greater application rates shown in Table 4.3.
6. Fertilizer Bag Supplies
Additional production of some 2,500 tons of fertilizer daily from
MUltan plus the corresponding increase in foodgrains (and the probable later
impact of the Fauji 1,500 tpd urea project) will impose a strain on the avail-
ability of baga. Since jute became largely unavailable after the separation
of Bangladesh, recourse to domestically-produced cotton bags lined with imported
polyethylene has become widespread. Typical price of a 50 kilogram (kg) bag
for urea is PRs 3.20 including PRs 0.60 for the liner, while a 37.8 kg bag for
CAN costs Rs 2.95 including PRs 0.5 for the liner. To conserve domestically-
grown cotton for export purposes, the use of woven polyethylene liner and based
on imported polymers is contemplated.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 32
However, oil shortages in Europe, Japan and USA may drastically
reduce the availability of these polymers. Proposals to make them from
domestically available naphtha or heavier bydrocarbons have been prepared,
but investment costs are in the US$100 million category for a suitable
integrated polyolefinea complex and ultimate availability of bags from this
source, even if approved in the mid-seventies, would be several years hence.
Therefore, attention must be given now to ensure an adequate supply of bags
for the Multan project. This subject has been discussed in detail with NFC's
consultants and possible use of alternative materials for bags, such as paper
or straw, reuse of old bags, bulk handling and other suggestions are being
explored.

portion to the totals for the country have been consumed in the Punjab and
the NWFP
Averae of Last Three Years - 1968/69, 1969/70, 1971/72

P205               66%          10.1%            76.1%
It is anticipated that these proportions will continue.  Thus, for
N and P205 the projected demands in the Punjab and NWF provinces will be
approximately 75% of the totals for the country, as given in Table 5.3 and
5.5. Projected increases in production will all be based in the Punjab, with
the exception of the proposed MAP plant at Karachi, which is anticipated to
be based on imported P205 and domestic N. The corresponding projected N
balance for the Punjab is given in the following Table 5.7:

1980/81         658                 697                39
Thus, it can be seen that in 1977/78, the Punjab wculd be producing
surplus nitrogen fertilizer if the large Fauji  plant were built.  IHowever, as
this plant would be only 20 miles or  so from the Sind, which represents a
large and expanding market, no diffculties for the Multan or Fauji projects
are foreseen as there will be a net N shortage for the country, as shown in
Table 5.5. Furthermore, since Multan is in a prime marketing area of the coun-
try which also consumes about 64% of N sales in the Province, and the envisaged
Fauji plant would be located 200 miles away, no significant competition from
Fauji or vice-versa is foreseen for N fertilizers. The corresponcing situation
for phosphate fertilizers is shown in Table 5.8, based on 75% of total country
P205 and assuming all Pakferco's MAP output is used in the Sind.

Thus, there should be a continued and growing shortage of domestically
produced P205 fertilizers in the Punjab and NWF Provinces, even after the
Multan nitrophosphate plant is built. Further domestic production therefore
is of high priority and during negotiations the Bank emphasized its interest
in closely following Pakistan plans to meet its growing requirements.
Competition
Nationwide:  Based on demand and supply calculations previously
reviewed, except for the possibility of the large Mari gas urea project,
no anticipated major competition is foreseen from any existing or new
fertilizer plant likely to be built before 1980/81, either in terms of N or
P 90.  In fact, these projections show the need for additional domestic
ritgogen and phosphate production capacity in the late 1970's (see Tables
5.3, 5.5 and Figures 5.1 and 5.2).
In the Punjab and NW Frontier Provinces: No significant N or P 0

MJLTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
Fertilizer Distribution, Credit, Prices and Transportation
Distribution
National
From 1967 to October 1973, fertilizers in Pakistan were sold and
distributed either by the producer (e.g. Esso) or via a group of Principal
Agents who have representatives in mandi (market) towns throughout the
major agricultural areas. Major agents are: Dawood Corporation, Pakistan
National Oils and Jaffer Brothers for domestically produced products, plus
the Agricultural Supply Organization (ASO) for imported materials, The
Government establishes the upper limit of allowable marketing expenses as
well as maximum sales prices to farmers, thus retaining control of allowable
costs. Total current marketing cost is estimated to be about PRs 50 per ton
of product. Thus whether Pakarab Fertilizers Limited were to set up its
owmn sales and distribution organization or sell through others, the marketing
margin would be controlled. However, marketing zeal and efficacy would
depend on the ability of the selling organization. From 1964 to 1966, WPIDC
undertook its own marketing and NFC still retains a promotional group that is
now strongly emphasizing the use of more phosphate fertilizers. In the case
of Multan project, the Government has agreed to enable the company to utilize
or establish an efficient distribution network.
Punjab Province
In the Punjab Province, the provincial government re-entered ferti-
lizer distribution in October 1973, and tried to take over full distribution
from the private and public sector plants. One private sector plant (Esso),
located outside the Punjab, is allowed, under agreements with the central
gitovernment, to distribute all of its output itself, including its sales in
t.he Punjab which are about 15% of Esso's production. The other private sector
placnt (DH) located in the Punjab, has obtained a compromise allowing it to
distribute half of its output through its three private agents with the other
half going to the provincial govermment's newly created Punjab Agricultural
Supply Corporabion (PASC). NFC distributes its entire output for the Punjab
through PASC.
Credit
Credit is provided for fertilizer through the system of commercial
banks, agricultural supply corporation, cooperatives and the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan. More-affluent farmers often pay cash for ferti-
lizer and other reeds. Credit is usually available to middle-income farmers via
the local cooperatives, which may borrow from member farmers of the Agricultural
Bank at about 8% and lend to farmers at rates up to 10%. Some cooperatives



ANNEX ^-
Page 2
obtain pledges or loans up to PRs 1,000 in the form of mortgages on chattels
on future crops.  In some cases, free loans may be given for 4 months and
interest charred thereafter. Interviews with several Punjab cooperative
organizatiors in August 1972 indicated defaults are rare, as their committees
are free to extend a loan in genute hardship cases or demand repayment,
according to circumstances.
Thus, subsistence farmers and cultivators in the remoter rural areas
seem to have the most-pressing needs for credit facilities to buy fertilizers
and othe7- inputs.  This has been emphasized by PASC which has promised to bring
not only fertilizer, seeds and other inputs to these communities but also the
credit to purchase them. Some of these loans would be interest-free and secured
by future crops. (It should be mentioned that a similar program undertaken by
a foreunner of PASC some years ago failed because of major defaults on loans.)
Transportation
Until a few years ago, the majority of fertilizer was carried by rail
from Karachi port or the domestic plants to the railhead towns and from these
to the mandi (market) and village godowns (warehouses) by truck or cart. More
recent experience of Dawood Hercules (DH) and Multan shows that road transport
can be speedier and cheaper if the distance is under 150 to 200 miles. As
typical distances between Multan and major godowns will be 90 to 100 miles, it
is estimated that some two-thirds of the output will go by road and one-third
by rail. Average road freight charges for DH are PRs 0.17 per ton/mile or PRs 17
per ton of fertilizer. Rail transport is expected to cost more, as distances
will be longer and typical freight rates are anticipated to be about PRs 20 per
ton.
Multan has a big truck depot where many empty vehicles are readily
available and truckers are always anxious to secure additional loads. The
city is located 35 miles south and 60 miles north of two of the largest
make-up yards in the country, which should help the availability of empty
wagons and expedite turnarounds.
Discussions with the Department of Railways in October 1973 indicated no
anticipated difficulties in handling either phosphate rock and "seeding" ferti-
lizer imports from Karachi to the Multan area, or subsequent bagged fertilizer
from the plant to the railheads in the mandi towns. Mr. Abdul Qadid, Chief
Operating Superintendent was fully aware of Multan's additional transport needs.
He plqns to run a "unit" rock train every other day from Karachi to the plant
and will assemble unit loads of fertilizer at the plant that will be made up
into mixed traffic at major junctions for dispatch to the railheads. All key
agricu1tural areas are adequately supplied with railroad freight service and
even towns more than 150 miles from Lahore or Multan are scheduled to get at
leas-t one freight train daily. Furthermore, agricultural materials are second
priority only to military traffic.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 3
Assuming 50% of Multan's production or about 1,400 tons per day
were moved by rail, this represents only one, or at the most, two trains per
day and as main line traffic does not go through Multan, no bottlenecks are
foreseen. As much as 16,000 tons per day of fertilizer and wheat has been
handled in and out of the Karachi port yards. At Multan, the plant sidings are
managed and maintained by the Department of Railways, and the costs billed to
the plant. Only minor additions will be needed to accommodate the additional
production.

The sale price of urea includes a "development surcharge" of
PRs LOO per ton, payable by the producer to the Government, to be used
to subsidize imports that exceed the PRs 1,100 charged. A corresponding
surcharge of PRs 300 per ton for NP has been assumed in this project
appraisal on the basis that ex-factory prices would be similar (46% of
total nutrients). It can be argued that, as there would be no need to
import for the time being significant amounts of NP once the Multan pro-
ject is producing at high capacity, the logic of the surchbrge being used
t.o pay ror phosphate imports would be lost. However, it is likely GOP
m;y continue to apply thLi development surcharge to help pay for nitrogen
Fertilizer imports too, as long, as thoy are brought in at prices higher
than t.ho;e ror dome;stically produced materials.

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Facilities
The project consists of the modernization and expansion of the
existing nitrogen fertilizer plant known as the Natural Gas Fertilizer
Factory (NGFF) in the Province of Punjab at Multan. Major items include:
(a)  Design and construction of a 910 metric ton per day
(tpd) ammonia plant that will derive feedstock and
fuel from natural gas supplied from the Sui gas
fields by the Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd.
(b)  Design and construction of a nitric acid plant in
two identical streams having a capacity totalling
1,200 tpd (100% nitric acid basis).
(c)  Design and construction of a nitrophosphate plant of
1,020 tpd capacity as prilled NP fertilizer, con-
taining 22.5% Nitrogen (N) and 22.5% P205, with pro-
vision for adding potassium salts, as required, to
make NPK grades. The products will contain phosphates
having at least 80% water solubility.
(d)  Design and construction of a calcium ammonium nitrate
plant to produce 1,500 tpd of calcium ammonium nitrate
(CAN) containing 26.5% N. Part will be made by
separating calcium nitrate (CN) from the nitrophosphate
and coverting it to ammonium nitrate (CAN) and part by
directly reacting ammonia and nitric acid. The two
solutions will be mixed together with by-product chalk
from the CN conversion step and prilled to form a solid
CAN product.
(e)  Integration of the above new plants with existing urea,
ammonium nitrate limestone (ANL) and nitric acid plants
and their utilities.
(f)  Construction of offsites and utilities including a
power plant to supply all of the above units, to pro-
vide maximum reliability and independence from outside
sources, plus lower utility and operating costs.
Existing offsites such as housing, storage, maintenance



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
and office buildings, will be used to the optimum
extent and integrated with the new facilities.
(g) Provision for the continuing employment of local con-
sultants (Chemical Consultants Ltd., Pakistan), who
have made major contributions to the concept, design
and detailing of the project as well as to marketing
and cost studies.
(h) Provision for employing a team of Technical Advisors
to assist and advise on the construction and subsequent
operation of the expanded plant until average production
of the Project is 90% of rated annual capacity.
(i) Provision for training technical personnel in plants
using technology similar to those to be employed in
the project.
Proaucts mentioned in (a) and (b) above are product intermediates and
will not normally be sold to others.
Production Flow Chart
Integration of existing and new process units, which are all
fed from a new ammonia mother-plant is shown diagrammatically in Annex 4-2.
It should be mentioned that some flexibility has been designed into the
complex by providing a direct-neutralization ammonium nitrate plant slightly
larger than the process material balance requires. This is to ensure' that
when the NP or other units are taken off-stream for periodic cleaning or
unscheduled stoppages, the ammonia plant need not be upset by reducing its
output sigriificantly.
The material balance indicated gives last ammonia priority to
the existing ammonium nitrate-limestone ANL (CAN) unit, which will
operate to the extent of available ammonia. In practice, there may be
sufficient reserve capacity in the new NP and CAN units to use all
available ammonia. The existing CAN granulation plant will be retained
for occasions when the new CAN units are off-stream and also for making
granulated mixed fertilizers to special formulations.

Future Provisions
Heavy-Water Production
Discussions have been held between NFC and the Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC) on extracting heavy hydrogen from the reformed
gas at Multan, prior to ammonia synthesis.  AEC will pipe the gas to an
extraction unit locate outside the Multan fertilizer plant and return
it to the synthesis section after removing the heavy hydrogen. Provisions
for installing this unit have been made in the early design stages of the
project to avoid interruptions in the amonia plant.
N-P-K Compound Fertilizer Production
As mentioned in Annex 4-1, provision will be made in the new
nitrophosphate plant to incorporate potash salts for producing prilled
N-P-K grades, when required.  Also, as indicated in Annex 4-3, the
existing ANL granulation unit can be -adapted to produce a wide variety of
granular N-P-K fertilizers, according to specific agronomic needs.
Methanol Manufacture
Possibilities of modifying at least one of the existing ammonia
units to produce methanol for plastics manufacture and other purposes
are to be studied.
By-Product Recovery from Pollution Abatement Units
As mentioned in Annex 4-6, the commercial prospects for reducing
nitrogen oxides emitted by the nitric acid plants by caustic washing and
selling the resultant sodium nitrite are under review. Also to be investi-
gated are possible markets for fluosilicate or fluoride salts produced from
fluorine-containing gases scrubbed from the nitrophosphate plant.
Use of By-Product Chalk for Cement Production
It is planned to stockpile this material as feed for an envisaged
cement plant to be built near the 14ultan fertilizer factory.
Additional Fertilizer Production
Ample space exists inside and outside the factory boundary to
accommodate an additional ammonia plant and downstream facilities, if
these be found justified in the future. In determining final layouts of
the expanded plant and offsites, these future possibilities will be
borne in mind.

PRODUCTION PROCESSES
Process Descriptions
(a)  Ammonia Production
Anmonia manufacture in large modern plants involves simultaneous,
large-scale steam production to provide maximum use of supplemental fuel
and also reaction heat evolved in the process. The four major plant
sections are:
Natural Gas Purification and Reforming: The Multan plant will
use Sui aatural gas for both feedstock and fuel purposes. The gas at
about 40 atmospheres or 600 lbs per square inch (psi) line pressure will
be catalytically treated to remove traces of sulfur compounds and then
reformed by treatment at high temperature with steam over a nickel catalyst
in a tubular furnace, followed by further catalytic action by air in a
second reformer. In this way, methane in the feed gas is mostly converted
to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and the requisite amount of air is admitted
to provide the desired ultimate nitrogen to hydrogen ratio of 1:3. Large
amounts of heat are recovered as high-pressure steam from this plant section
and subsequently used to drive turbines for centrifugal gas compression,
thereby contributing greatly to the efficiency of the entire process.
Gas Shift Conversion and Purification: Carbon monoxide is con-
verted (or "shifted") to carbon dioxide and hydrogen using appropriate
iron and copper-based catalysts. The carbon dioxide (C02) is removed by
"scrubbing" with a suitable reagent such as potassium carbonate solution
which is subsequently heated to remove the C02 and regenerate the solution
C-
.Lor repeated use. The 002 can be used as a raw material for other processes;
in the l4ultan project, it will be used to produce urea and ammonium nitrate
fertilizers.  Small residual quantitie.s or carbon oxides in the ammonia
synthessis Egas are catalytically converted to methane and water which, along
with other small contaminants such as argon are purged from the system.
Wdhen required, argorn can be commercially recovered for welding and other
purposes,
Synthesis Gas Compression and Conversion to Ammonia:  Whereas
the t'oregoing steps are undertaken at about 40 and 27 atmospheres pressure
re:.pectively, ammonia synthesis is performed at much higher pressures
- usually in the 1140 to 315 atmospheres range according to the process
usedi. After compressing in a turbine-driven centrifugal machine, the
"syngas" is passed over an iron-based catalyst and part is converted to



ANNEX h-3
Page 2
ammonia (NHT3) which is liquefied by cooling and bled from the synthesis
loop as product.  Unconverted gas is recycled to the catalytic converter
by another conpressor until conversion is complete. The syngas must be
brought to a high temperature (about 5000C) as well as a high pressure
before being catalytically converted.  As the synthesis reaction produces
a large amount of heat, the temperature of the syngas can be suitably
raised and the hot, partially converted gas, cooled simultaneously by-
passing both gases separately through an appropriate heat exchanger. In
some plants, was-te reaction heat is used to produce additional steam for
energy purposes.
Nitric Acid M4anufacture from Ammonia
Nitric acid production from ammonia takes place in two main
stages - conversion and oxidation-absorption. In the first stage, lique-
fied ammonia is vaporized, mixed.with.the correct proportion of cleaned
air and converted to nitrous oxides by burning over an assembly of platinum-
rhodium alloy screens. The nitrous oxides are converted to nitric oxides
by the appropriate admission of air or oxygen and these gases. absorbed by
water in a tall column to produce a nitric acid solution containing 57 to
6o'fOl HN03. The conversion reaction produces much heat, which is used to
raise steam for driving a turbine which powers several gas compressors
used in the process.  After absorption of most of the nitrogen oxides,
proces; gas leaving the column is heated by transferring heat, via a
suitable exchanger, from other in-process gas and expanded in a gas turbine
to produce additional compressor power.
The turbine exhaust is normally diluted with air to yield a
stack gas containing 200 to 300 parts per million (ppm) of nitrogen oxides
(NOx) before release to atmosphere. In some heavily-populated areas of the
world, waste gases from nitric acid plants are catalytically reduced with
mnethane or another fuel to produce low levels of nitrogen oxides (200 to
400 ppm) of nitrogen oxides plus oxygen. This results in a colorless
effluient gas and one which is much less likely to contribute to smog by
reactiing photosynthetically with hydrocarbons emitted by automobiles and
other sources.  Recently, a caustic wash treatment process for reducing
N0x pollution from nitric acid plants has been developed and installed
in Germany.  This produces sodium nitrite and nitrate as by-products,
which have commercial value.  Both the catalytic method and the caustic
wash method are presently under study by the selected contractor (Uhde)
for possible use at Multan.
There are numerous designs of nitrid acid processes available,
mostly depending on the operating pressures chosen for the different
steps.  High pressures result in lower capital cost but increased power
needs and platinum losses. The designer endeavors to optimize these costs
according to circumstances. The MIultan plant will employ a combination of

Nitrophosphate and Calciurm Ammonium Nitrate Production
NitropAosphate Manufacture - General
Nitrophosphates are mixtures of ammonium phosphates, ammonium
nitrate and a small amount of dicalcium phosphate. Thus, they are com-
binations of conventional fertilizer or salts and are not unique
chemical compounds. They are made by dissolving
phosphate rock in nitric acid instead of sulifuric acid and
separating the undesired calcium as useful calcium nitrate crystals
insteac! of waste calc~ium sulfate (gypsum) prior to ammoniation.  A more
appropriate name would be ammonium phosphate-nitrate instead of nitro-
phosphate which is misleading.  Some earlier nitrophosphate (NP) processes
made fertilizers with low phosphate water-solubility that gave slower
responses under certain soil and crop conditions. Modern processes such
as the one to be instnlled at Multan (Dutch State Mines)
produce ammonium phosphate-nitrate mixtures, containing about 23% N and
23% P205 with P205 water solubilities of at least 80%. These give crop
yields at least as good as those obtained with other nitrogen and phosphate
Lertilizer; (see Annex 3-2) and millions of tons annually are produced and
used in Europe.
By-product calcium nitrate from the NP plant can be converted
to a solid prilled or granular product.   Or, it can be reacted with
ammonia and carbon dioxide to produce ammonium nitrate (AN) and by-product
calTium carbonate. The AN is usually converted to solid granules or prills
corntaining 35;W N, or combined with some by-product calcium carbonate before-
hand to produce fertilizers containing 26% to 33% N, as desired.  The by-
prodtuct calcium carbonate can be used as a soil dressing, or as a "chemical
chalk" in chemical and cement production, or simply discarded. Throwing
away unwanted calcium carbonate compared to discarding gypsum from phosphate
plants using sulfuric acid, represents a much lower economic loss. The
chalk represents merely unwanted calcium from the phosphate rock and by-
product carbon dioxide from the ammonia plant.  Discarded gypsum contains
all of the sulfur purchased to make sulfuric acid. No sulfur will be used
in the Multan NP process, as phosphate rock will be solubilized by nitric
acid made from ammonia produced from indigenous natural gas. Reliance on
imported sulfur will be eliminated and corresponding foreign exchange
savings will be considerable.
The Process
Phosplhate rock containing about 35% P20 is digested with nitric
ac',id and ammoniated. Reaction products include phosphoric acid, ammonium

phosphate, ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate. The reaction liquor is
centrifuged or filtered to remove insolubles and then chilled with brine
to crystallize the calcium nitrate (CN), which is separated by centrifuging
or filtration. The CN crystals are washed, melted and converted by
reacting with ammonia and carbon dioxide to anmmonium nitrate plus preci-
pitated chalk, which is filtered off and can be used as outlined above.
The ammonium nitrate liquor is evaporated prior to prilling and
is supplemented by ammonium nitrate made by direct reaction between ammonia
and nitric acid in a separate unit.  The two highly concentrated solutions
or rrmelt,3n are mixed with an appropriate amount of by-product chalk and
prilled by spraying from the top of a large cylindrical tower and the solid
spheres or prills cooled, coated with a moisture resistant agent and bagged.
The TNP liquor, after removal of CN, is also evaporated, prilled, cooled,
treated and bagged. Present plans call for making a CAN product at Multan
containing 26.5% N but this may later be increased to 33% N by adding less
chalk. The NP product will contain about 23% N and 23% P205 but provision
will be made to add a potassium salt at a future time to make N-P-K grades.
If desired, AN and NP liquors can be combined before prilling to give
different ratios of N and P205 in the NP product.  Design capacities are
1,020 tpd of NP 23-23-0 and 1,500 tpd of CAN (26.5% N), but actual CAN
production will depend on the net amount of ammonia available after supply-
ing the NP and existing urea and CAN plants.
Existing Plants
Existing production units at Multan comprise:
Two, 100 tpd ammonia units based on natural gas;
One, 60 tpd ammonia package unit based on natural gasW/
One, 200 tpd nitric acid and high pressure unit;
One, 180 tpd tpd crystalline urea unit;
One, 330 tpd ammonium nitrate-limestone unit, (ANL) unit.
The ammonia units have never attained design capacity and will
be shut down. Possibly they may be converted to produce methanol
at a future date. The existing urea unit is being converted to make a
prilled product and the tower is now under construction. (Prilled urea
is much more suitable than a crystalline material,which sets quickly into
a hard mass in tropical climates.) The modified plant should produce at
least 220 tons per day. The existing nitric acid and ANL (CAN) units
will be retained and used to supplement the new plants, and granular CAN
will be made to the extent of ammonia available. The economies and
other considerations regarding the continued use of the existing units
are reviewed below, and the integrated plant flow chart is depicted in
Annex )4-2.

Economic and Other Considerations Regarding the Continued Use of Existing
Urea, lNitric Acid and CAN Units
Urea Plant
This is an Inventa (Swiss) plant of the recycle type and was
designed to produce 180 metric tpd of crystalline urea. It has been
critically inspected by specialist contractors such as Humphreys and
Glasgow,and Stamicarbon, who both have pronounced it to be in good operating
condition, with many more years of additional life. They have recommended
several modifications, plus the addition of a prilling tower, to enable it
to produce up to 220 tpd of prilled product, when sufficient ammonia is
available from the new ammonia plant. These alterations and the construc-
tion of a suitable tower are now being undertaken in conjunction
with Stamicarbon engineers.
The plant is virtually fully depreciated and the
loan on it has been repaid. Under these conditions (but including depre-
ciation on the new equipment), the following estimated comparison on a
battery-limits basis with a large new stripping plant and using Multan
utility costs, is of interest.

ANNEX 4-3
Page 6
It is of interest to note that the reported current cost for
bagged urea mTde in the Dawood-Hercules plant in Pakistan is about
PRs h13/ton.L
The above comparison indicates it is expedient to re-;ain and
operate the existing urea plant after suitable modification, as the extra
costs per ton due to slightly less-efficient operation and smaller size,
are more than offset by the high depreciation and interest costs incurred
by a large new plant. Furthermore, the product will find a ready sale,
as prilled urea is popular.
Nitric Acid Plant
The existing 200 tpd unit was designed and supplied by C & I Inc.
of the USA, and is reported to be virtually trouble-free and good for many
more years of service.  It is aliTmost   fully depreciated and the
loan has been repaid. Since it will use the same ammonia,
utilities and other services as the two 600 tpd units planned for the
expansion project, it is very probable that comparative production costs
will be of the same order as those calculated for a small, depreciated
urea unit and a large new one. Recent evaluations indicate a probable
battery-limits cost of PRs 186 per ton nitric acid (100%) for 600 tpd
units using ammonia at PRs 350 per ton and corresponding nitric acid cost
from the existing units about PRs 180 per ton.
Further considerations in wishing to retain the existing unit
instead of scrapping it and installing two new 700 tpd units (instead of
two 600 tpd ones) were transportation problems and also the limited
experience of contractors in building such large plants overseas.
ANL Plant
The present plant was supplied by the French ENSA group and
has proved reliable. It was designed to produce 330 tpd of granular
product, but has shown it can easily do 15% more. The likelihood is
that a small depreciated plant of this nature, can produce for about the
same or slightly lower cost than a large new one (about US$38 per ton)
using the same raw materials, utilities and other services. Furthermore,
it is a rule of thumb in the fertilizer industry that granulation usually
costs at least US$1 less per ton of product than prilling for outputs
up to about 750 tpd. Also, granulation plants are more flexible and for
this reason, it is wished to retain the unit for probable future produc-
tion of granular mixed fertilizers based on urea, NP and other materials.
1/ This operates between 100% and 110% of design capacity.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 7
In addition, it will be a useful back-up unit when the main CAN plants are
stopped for maintenance and cleaning.
There is the additional probability that sufficient reserve
capacity will exist in the new CAN direct ammoniation and calcium nitrate
conversion units to absorb all surplus ammonia and nitric acid remaining
from nitrophosphate production. Under these circumstances, any doubts
regarding higher costs in making the granular product would not arise.
In fact, projections indicate in 1976/77 (the first on-stream year), if
priority is given to other products, no ammonia will be available to make
any granular CAN.
Utilities and Offsites
Main additional utilities required for the new process plants are:
Electrical  Generators              - Two, 10 MW (Steam) sets
Steam Boilers                       - Three, 60 tph units
Cooling Towers                      - Two, with a total capacity of
30,000 cubic meters per hour
Boiler Feedwater Installation      - Two, 125 tph units
Instrument and Plant Air            - Two, 100 normal cubic meter sets
Water Decarbonation Unit            - One, 1,100 cubic meter per hour
No process or patent fees are required to be paid for purchase and use of
these utility units.
These new utilities will be integrated with existing utilities
and offsites to the optimum extent which include cooling towers, product
and material storage buildings, offices, maintenance shops, laboratory,
garage, railroad track, sewers, roads, boundary fences and gatehouses,
plus a nearby housing colony for 600 families. Two existing gas-fired
boilers each of 25 tph capacity will be placed on standby.

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
RAW MATERIALIS
Natural Gas
RIeserves: The Multan plant currently has a contract with Sui
Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) to supply 12.5 million standard
cubic feet (M2scft) of gas per day from their system. In addition, the
plant now purchases about 18,000 to 20,000 kw per hour from a nearby
power station, for which 5.7 M2scft of corresponding gas are required
daily. Thus, present direct and indirect gas needs for Multan amount to
18.2 M2scft per day. Feedstock and fuel needs for the expanded project
operating at 100% capacity will be 50 M2scft/day, including all energy
requirements, which will be generated within the plant. Additional
gas needs, including 10% contingency will therefore be about 35 M2scft per
day whirh, during the next 15 years, are equivalent to about 0.18 trillion
soft (M4scft). Latest estimates of Sui reserves are 8.9 (M4scft) out of
which 4.9 M4scft are already dommitted.  Therefore, the expanded Project
will make a demand of 0.18 M4scft on uncommitted reserves of 4 AM'scft,
i.e. only about 4.5Y,which can be met easily.
Transmission:  The existing SNGPL line capacity between Sui
and Multan must be enlarged by installing short loops totalling 28 miles
to meet Multan's expanded needs. SNGPL has developed a two-phase plan
known as Project 4 to provide additional gas to Multan and other customers.
Phase A covers Multan's extra needs up to 38 M2scft/day is scheduled to
be ready by June 1976. This would give a total system capacity of 3L41
M?t2scft/day. Phase B is scheduled to be ready by December 1976 and
wouLd increase system capacity to 393 M2scft/day, to meet anticipated
growth in demand up to 1978. Phase A would cost about $6.7 million in foreign
exchange plus US$4.1 million equivalent local currency; about US$6.1 million
would be for a 18-inch pipe and installation, and US$h.7 million for a
100 M2cft/day purification unit if needed.
Completion of Phase A by early 1976 is believed realistic, provided
a turnkey contract for the design, supply and installation of Phase A can be
awarded in mid-1974. SNGPL does not anticipate a Bank loan for Phase A but
will do so for Phase B.



ANNEX 4-
Page 2
AsSurances have been obtained from GOP and SNGPL that the required additional
gas for the Multan expansion will be availableon an uninterruptable
basis by the end of June 1976, and according to requisite pressure
and purity specifications. (Gas delivered to the plant should not
contlain more than 35 parts per million of sulfur and it sometimes
contains as little as 10 ppm).
Price:   Future prices of gas delivered to the plant will vary
according to consumption rate and cost increases are projected to be:
Consumption
Plant Operation as % of Total Capacity        100%          90%           75%
Gas Consumption as % of Maximum               100%          92.5%         77.5%

*This is subject to further review in light of the IBRD Loan Agreement covenants.
Phosphate Rock
About 220,000 tons of phosphate rock will be needed to meet Multan's
reauirements at 100% of capacity. Investigations show favorable contracts can be
made with Jordan which has suDnolied annuallv about 35,000 tons of rock to the two
single-superDhosphate plants in Pakistan over many years. This rock contains an
average of 34.35% P205 and less than 0.1% chlorides, as required for the nitro-
phosphate plant. The rock would be shipped to Karachi and after bulk unloading
sent via rail to Multan in "unit trains," and discussions with the Department o
Railways have indicated no problems should arise in moving this relatively
small amount of additional material. Recently, phosphate rock deposits
have been found in the Hazara District of the North West Frontier Province,
but it is not yet known if the quality and quantity are adequate for
Multan's needs. Therefore, it will be assumed that all phosphate rock will
be imported. The future estimated landed and delivered prices are:

MULTAN FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND SAFETY
There are presently no gaseous, liquid or solid effluent standards
established for the Province of Punjab. Therefore, typical acceptable
levels in developed countries will be used as a basis for pollution control.
New Ammonia Plant
Gaseous effluents from this plant vented to atmosphere are flue
gases (water vapor and carbon dioxide (C02)) from the refor*ier furnaces
and waste C02 from the syngas carbon dioxide stripper unit. These are
harmless. Liquid effluents will be boiler blow-down and process conden-
sate; the latter will be used as process and cooling water make-up. No
use of toxic heavy-metal compounds in gas scrubbing, process cooling or
effluent water treatment is planned.
New Nitric Acid Plant
The contractor       (Uhde) has made provisions for the nitrogen
oxides concentration (NOx) in the stack gas to be below 200 parts per million
(ppm), by use of efficient absorbers and final dilution with air. The
possibility of installing a caustic wash and selling the resulting sodium
nitrite to others is under study. The 200 ppm NOx level is the acceptable
level for plants in built-up areas of most developed countries and should
therefore be quite suitable for Multan.
New NP and CAN Plants
Gaseous effluents will be mostly water vapor from the prill
towers, possibly containing very small amounts of fertilizer dust. It
is planned to minimize the latter for economic reasons by installing
exit-air baffles and filters. (Any small amount of dust escaping from
the towers would benefit local farmers in the form of free, non-burning
fertilizer.) Phosphate rock used in the NP section will contain 3% to
4% fluorine and about 25% of this will pass to the vapor lines of the
reaction and evaporation sections. These gaseous effluents will be
washed with water in highly efficient scrubbers before release to
atmosphere, to remove gaseous fluorides. Scrubber liquors will be
treated with lime to fix fluorides as insoluble calcium fluoride before
being pumped to settling ponds, and accumulated solids will be periodically
dug out and dumped in local ravines, along with small amounts of sand



ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
separated from the reaction system. The effluent system will be monitored
and controlled by chemical analysis. Possibilities of recovering fluorine
as sodium fluoride for sale to others, as well as recovery of rare earths
in the phosphate rock are to be studied. Surplus calcium carbonate will
be stockpiled for envisaged cement production in an adjacent plant.
New Utility Plants
Effluents from these plants will be mainly cooling-tower bleed
and backwash from the water-treatment units. The cooling tower effluent
will contain no toxic components and will considerably dilute other waste
streams. Acid and alkali wastes from the water-treatment units will be
used to neutralize each other to the extent possible and any excess
acidity will be removed by limestone treatment before discharge to the
effluent pond. Evaporation will keep pond levels to a minimum and greatly
reduce or even eliminate overflow to a nearby canal. The final pond over-
flow, as well as inflows, will be routinely monitored by chemical analysis
to ensure effluent treatments are adequate.
Existing Plant Units
Gaseous effluents are mostly water vapor and carbon dioxide from
the boilers, ammonia units and downstream production units. Gas-purification
effluents from the existing ammonia plants will be eliminated, as these units
will be shut down. The nitric acid unit produces a colored tail gas, and
this will be reduced to about 200 ppm, NOx content by improved absorption
and increased dilution (and perhaps caustic washing if a market for sodium
nitrite can be found). Dust from the new urea prill tower will be minimized
by filters for economic reasons and simultaneously reduced to acceptable
limits. Dust from the ammonium nitrate-limestone unit will be considerably
reduced as the use of by-product "chemical" chalk will eliminate the need
to grind limestone.
General
All solids-conveying equipment and bagging machinery will be
under suction and these sytems will be provided with filters, for both
economic and dust-prevention reasons.
The Multan Expansion Project has therefore been designed to
meet pollution levels acceptable in typical developed countries.



ANNEX 4-6

Safety and Precautions
The new plants will be designed with full recognition of operator
safety and also environmental protection against spills and other hazards.
These measures, as well as fire protection and first-aid facilities will
be of the same standards as are used in developed countries and will be
extended to existing plant units, if found necessary.

The figures in this estimate are based on review of the Kellogg and
UJhde cost estimates prepared in February 1974 and discussed in London at a
round table meeting in March 1974. Rupee costs were revised in Pakistan in
March 197h.
For the purposes of this table: (a) the ADB is to finance all items
related to the nitric acid and NP/CAN plants (except the down payment for the
first 20% for engineering and know-how); (b) the IBRD is to finance all items
related to the ammonia plant and offsite utilities (except the down payment for
the first 20% for engineering and know-how); and (c) the equity paid in by NFC
and ADNOC is to finance, with foreign exchange, the first 20% for engineering
and know-how of all items.
All costs that are not specifically labelled "fixed" are indicative
estimates as of March 1974.

ANNEX 7-1
Page 3
The opportunity cost of natural gas and its effect on the economic
return of the project presents a special case in view of rapidly changing
petroleum (including natural gas) supply conditions and prices. Ihe price of
natural gas, delivered and suitable for fertilizer feedstock, can range from
about US$0.30-0.50/MCF (US$10-17/ton fuel oil) for surplus gas currently being
flared (as in the Persian Gulf); to about US$0.50-1.00/MCF (US$17-35/ton fuel
oil) as feed to an export liquified natural gas (LNG) or urea plant; to
US$1.40-2.00/MCF (US$54-70/ton fuel oil) as a substitute for domestically con-
sumed petroleum for fuel purposes. The above range of gas prices compares to
US$0.32/MCF used in the financial return. The opportunity cost of natural gas
varies considerably more than that of liquid petroleum since the conversion
cost of gas to other useful products (such as LNG or urea) and its transporta-
tion costs (by pipeline or as LNG) vary over a much wider range than that of
oil. As a result, the opportunity cost of gas (or gas products) for export is
usually much lower than for domestic consumption. Therefore, for this project,
since the products are for domestic use and the natural gas, at least in part,
displTces domestic liquid fuel consumption, an equivalent heating value of fuel
oil and gas has been used in determining the opportunity cost of gas. The
economic return is based on a gas price of US$1.40/MCF (equivalent to US$54/ton
heavy fuel oil or about US$7-8 per barrel. If petroleum prices in world trade
continue at a relatively high level of US$6-12/barrel (US$42-84/ton), equivalent
to a natural gas price of about US$1-2/MCF, then the economic price of fertilizer
products must increase also. At the higher price levels for gas, alternative
fuels such as coal and lignite on a world-wide basis, are likely to become
economic feedstocks for nitrogen fertilizers. Numbers in parenthesis are equi-
valent prices for heavy fuel oil based on heating value, and are included for
information only, not to impute a corresponding opportunity cost of oil.
