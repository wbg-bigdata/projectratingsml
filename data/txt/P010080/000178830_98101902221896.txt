INTERNATIONAL BAuNK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO PAKARAB FERTILIZERS LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR THE
MULTAN FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Pakarab Fertilizers Limited (PFL) with the guarantee of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$35 million to help finance
a project for expanding the Natural Gas Fertilizer Factory at Multan. The
loan would have a term of 15 years, including 4 years of grace, with in-
terest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. Pakistan would charge PFL a guarantee
fee of 2-1/4 percent per annum on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan,
bringing the cost of the loan to PFL to 9-1/2 percent per annum. In
January, 1974, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) made two loans to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, amounting to US$27 million for the project.
One loan of US$19.25 million is for 15 years, including a 4-year grace
period, and bears interest at 7-1/2 percent per annum; the other loan of
US$7.75 million, is for 40 years, including a 10-year grace period, and
bears interest at 1 percent per annum. The ADB loans are to be relent
to PFL for a period of 15 years, including a 4-year grace period, with
an interest rate of 9-1/2 percent per annum.
2.        The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), an agency of
Abu Dhabi, a state of the United Arab Emirates, is also partipating in the
project with a 30 percent subscription to the share capital of PFL equivalent
to US$11 million. The remainder of the financing would be provided by the
Government of Pakistan in equity (US$27 million equivalent) and loans
(US$6.4 million equivalent) on terms satisfactory to the Bank.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
3.        The most recent economic report "Economic Situation and Prospects
of Pakistan" (74-PAK, dated February 16, 1973) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 2, 1973 (R73-76). An economic mission visited
Pakistan in November 1973 and its report is expected very shortly. A
country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
4.        The economy of Pakistan (the former West Pakistan) grew rapidly
during the Second Plan (1960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7 percent per
annum. This high growth was spearheaded by an industrial growth of 13.1
percent per annum. However, agriculture grew by only 3.7 percent per annum.
West Pakistan's overall economic growth slowed down somewhat during the
Third Plan (1965-70) to about 6 percent per annum. The industrial growth
rate fell to 7.6 percent, but agricultural output grew at 5.6 percent
annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice varieties, reducing,
but not eliminating, the food deficit.



- 2 -
5.        Though it is hardly apparent in these figures, Pakistan's econo-
mic development began to encounter a number of difficulties after 1965.
Import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that time be-
came permanent as the shortage of foreign exchange and budget resources
persisted, owing to higher defense expenditure, rising foreign debt service,
and decreased nonproject foreign aid. Both net capital inflow and domestic
savings declined, and investment fell from about 22 percent of GDP in
1964/65 to about 17 percent in 1969/70, and to only 11 percent in 1971/72.
The slowdown in industrial growth, along with urban population growth rates
of more than 5 percent, led to a rapid rise in urban unemployment. In
rural areas, it was the larger farmers of West Pakistan who got most of
the benefits from the new "green revolution".
6.        The economy underwent severe strains during 1970/71 and 1971/72,
reflecting both political events and a prolonged drought which virtually
halted the increase in agricultural output. In 1972/73, however, the eco-
nomy showed signs of revival. With a recovery in industrial production and
a record wheat crop of 7.4 million tons, GDP is estimated to have grown by
about 6 percent. Devaluation in May 1972 has been successful in making
Pakistani exports more competitive in international markets, in increasing
incentives to produce for the local market, and in bringing about a much
more liberal system of import control. Because of flood damage to the cotton and
rice crops and increased prices and quantities of imports, however, the trade gap
is expected to widen considerably in 1973/74. The State Bank's net fore:Lgn ex-
change reserves, which doubled to US$360 million in the year ended June J973, are
expected to decline by US$100-150 million this fiscal year. In 1974/75, however the
trade deficit is projected to be as much as US$250 million less than in 1973/74.
7.        The floods which occurred after the monsoon last year were a
set-back for the reviving economy, which the Government expected to grow
by 8 percent in 1973/74. The floods caused damage to standing crops of
cotton, rice, sugar and animal fodder. There were also substantial losses
of wheat stocks and cattle, and damage, in some areas, to farm equipment,
homes, transport, telecommunications and canal networks. Nevertheless,
intensive efforts to repair flood damage, replant damaged acreage, and
otherwise maximize output are expected to result in a 5 to 6 percent
growth rate. A mission from the Bank and the United Nations visited
Pakistan last October to assess the flood damage and the need for external
aid. Based on its report, a credit for flood rehabilitation was approved
on March 12 this year.
8.        The major problems now facing Pakistan are to stimulate output
and employment, to control inflation, to increase public and private saving
and investment, and to improve the distribution of income. Despite
reasonably rapid growth in 1972/73, the domestic supply of essential
consumption goods is still inadequate. Together with the increased income
resulting from the strong rise in exports, this has been an important factor
behind the rapid rise in prices. Wholesale and consumer prices increased
20 percent or more in 1972/73 reflecting both these domestic pressures and
sharp increases in international prices for Pakistan's principal exports
(cotton, cotton textiles, and rice) and imports. Since attempts to contain



inflation through increased subsidies and price controls were having but
limited success, the Government last summer took strong measures to curb
demand. The flood caused a sharp increase in prices in August and September
but since then the cost of living index has been rising at considerably less
than the pre-flood rate.
9.        The present high prices of Pakistan's major exports may well
decline, with adverse effects on the balance of payments and public finances.
Recorded investment in real terms has not increased much in the current year,
but there is evidence that unrecorded investment in small-scale industry and
agriculture has been substantial. If the necessary saving and investment
are forthcoming, Pakistan's growth prospects are good. Exports seem limited
more by supply constraints rather than lack of demand (with the important
exception of the textile quotas in importing countries).
10.       Water from Tarbela Dam will probably be available from the end
of 1974 and the increasing participation of small and medium-scale farmers
in the "green revolution" could mean that agricultural growth in the next
5 years will at least match the 5.6 percent annual rate of the 1965-70 Third
Plan period. Capital goods, light engineering goods, and agro-based indus-
tries also have good growth prospects. The recent rise in the oil price
will obviously be a constraint on Pakistan's growth but the economy does
have certain strengths which make it less vulnerable to the oil shortage
than most developing countries. Electric power production is derived
roughly equally from hydro resources and natural gas, with only a very
small proportion based on oil. Furthermore, new hydro-power will soon
become available; by 1976, hydro-electric power generation is expected to
be double its 1973 level, which will add about 50 percent to total output.
Pakistan's exports are expected to increase in 1974/75 by more than the
added costs of petroleum imports. Provided therefore that Pakistan can
obtain foreign capital and generate domestic savings sufficient to
finance the necessary investment, there are reasonable prospects
that economic growth could average about 7 percent annually over the next
several years.
11.       Pakistan's external public debt at the end of December 1972
amounted to US$4.8 billion equivalent, of which US$870 million was undis-
bursed. Pakistan's debt service, as presently scheduled, would rise from
US$180 million in 1972/73 to about US$400 million by 1975/76. This rapid
increase reflects the debt rescheduling operations which were arranged in
May 1972 and June 1973; it would mean a rise in the debt service ratio from
18 percent in 1972/73 to around 30 percent in 1975/76. However, it is not
likely that Pakistan will be called upon to repay as much as this; countries
which are members of the Pakistan Consortium have agreed that, after
July 1, 1974, Pakistan will not be asked to service debts on account of
projects visibly located in Bangladesh. Moreover, Consortium countries
have agreed to consider providing further debt relief to Pakistan on a
long-term basis. The Bank has prepared a study on this subject and the
matter is now under consideration by the Consortium.



- 4 -
12.       While such relief would certainly ease Pakistan's debt burden,
it will still be desirable for assistance to Pakistan to be on terms as
concessional as possible. For this reason, the major part of the Bank
Group aid to Pakistan is provided by IDA. However, some Bank lending to
Pakistan is justified. Until December 1973, when the Bank approved a
$25 million loan for industrial investment, no Bank loans had been made
since June 1970, and consequently, the volume of Bank loans disbursed
and outstanding has been declining over the past few years. On June 30,
1973, it amounted to $316 million equivalent, or less than 8 percent of
Pakistan's total external public debt. Including undisbursed balances,
Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 22 percent of
its external public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio might increase to
about 24 percent. The share of the Bank Group in total debt service is
now about 17 percent and is expected to decrease to about 10 percent in
1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
13.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for East and West) between the start of operations in 1952
and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had committed $1.2 billion to the
country, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank and one-half by
IDA. Of this amount, one loan and 19 development credits, totalling US$4.7
million and US$168.1 million, respectively (net of cancellation), were for
projects located wholly within what was then East Pakistan and another 10
loans and 8 development credits involved expenditures in both East and West
Pakistan.
14.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA,
and it was agreed that Bangladesh would take over liability for credits
made for all projects in its territory, which were not completed. Accord-
ingly, 11 such credits in an aggregate amount of US$151.4 million have
since been made to Bangladesh. Of this amount, US$44.1 million has been
used for the notional repayment of amounts disbursed under the correspond-
ing previous credit agreements with Pakistan. Bangladesh has recently
agreed to enter discussions with all members of the Pakistan Consortium
concerning the assumption of liability for debts on account of projects
visibly located in Bangladesh. The Bank, too, has started discussions
with Bangladesh with a view to the taking over by Bangladesh of liabi-
lity for the remaining amounts which were fully disbursed for the
benefit of what is now Bangladesh under Bank loans and IDA credits to
Pakistan.
15.       Of the US$1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East and West), West
Pakistan received about 72 percent. During its long association with
Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy. Until 1972, 38 percent of the total commitments were for the
public services, 29 percent for agriculture, 22 percent for industry,
10 percent for industrial imports, and 1 percent for education. Lending



- 5 -
for public services amounted to some US$325 million and included loans
and credits for railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port,
highways, telecommunications and water supplies. A large part of the
lending for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for
industry has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Invest-
ment Corporation (PICIC). For all the projects for which loans and credits
are now being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactorily.
The principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by the
public services have not kept pace with the inflation and hence some
utilities are not earning the returns w:iich they need, and that some
borrowing agencies have financial problems arising from the loss of assets
in the former East Pakistan. Annex II c:ontains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of February 28, 1974 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
16.       Lending operations will in future have two main objectives.   The first
is to continue to improve the institutions which are responsible for the prin-
cipal public services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past,
namely, the Port of Karachi, the Telegraph and Telephone Department, the Water
and Power Development Authority, the Pakistan Railways, and the Sui Northern Gas
Pipelines Company. In all these, institutional improvements are being made with
technical assistance financed by the Bank and, in some cases, major reforms are
likely in the near future. The second objective is to expand lending operations
in other fields and, for this purpose, a number of missions have visited Pakistan,
or will shortly do so, in order to examine the problems and possibilities
of preparing projects in other sectors. A mission to review the drainage
and irrigation sector has just returned and has identified a number of projects
in the field of irrigation, salinity control and land reclamation. Another
mission has been studying the results of a UNDP-sponsored technical assistance
project for a master plan for the city of Karachi. Other missions which
will visit Pakistan in the next few months will study the Government's plans
for rural development and for the encouragement of small industries. Bank
Group assistance will also be continued for the industrial sector by
financial assistance for the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation (PICIC) and the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP).
17.       For the current fiscal year, two operations have already been
approved, a Bank loan of US$25 million for industrial investment to be
administered by PICIC and a credit of US$35 million for rehabilitation
after the flood of August 1973. A credit for the provision of an oil
terminal for the Port of Karachi will be presented to Executive Directors
shortly. A project for telecommunications is under consideration, and
projects for highway improvement, for the expansion of the natural gas
transmission system and for seed multiplication are being prepared.
18.       In addition to its lending operations, the Bank will continue
to serve as Chairman of the Pakistan Consortium. The next meeting of the
Consortium will be held in Paris on May 14 and 15, at which a new economic
report prepared by the Bank will be considered.



19.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million by
equity participations. (They are shown in Annex II). About US$14 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
General
20.       The Government of Pakistan attaches great importance to the
continued rapid growth in agricultural output, particularly the production
of food and export crops. To this end it is endeavoring to increase the
availability of major inputs such as water, fertilizers, improved seeds,
pesticides, farmer credit and information services. About 45 million
acres, or 23 percent of the country's total area is cultivated. The main
crops are wheat, cotton, rice and sugarcane. About 33 million acres, or
73 percent of the cropped area, are irrigated by an extensive system of
canals and tubewells. The province of the Punjab, the major agricultural
region with about 25 million cropped acres, has a particularly well developed
irrigation system.
21.       The Tarbela Dam project, which will be the largest earth and
rockfill dam in the world, is approaching completion and water will begin
to become available by the end of the year. To make effective use of the
increased amount of water, major increases in the application of fertilizers
will be necessary.
Fertilizer Market
22.       The substantial growth in agricultural output during the Third
Plan period (1965-70) was accompanied by rapid increases in the use of
fertilizers, although the application rate is still low compared with many
other countries. Most of the fertilizers used are nitrogen based. The
use of phosphorus (P20 ) and potassium (K) fertilizer is still very low
(about 11.1 percent ana 0.1 percent respectively of the total nutrients
consumed during 1972/73). In one decade from 1962/63 to 1972/73, fertilizer
use increased tenfold from 41,000 to 435,000 nutrient tons in 1972/73.
23.       During the last five years, consumption of nitrogen and P 0 has
grown from 203,500 to 386,000 nutrient tons and from 38,600 to 48,1805
nutrient tons respectively. But for the shortage of foreign exchange,
and more recently, the scarcity of fertilizers on world markets, coupled
with unprecedented price increases, even more rapid increases would have
occurred.
24.       Consumption of nitrogen fertilizer has greatly exceeded domestic
production, with the difference made up by imports. P205, however, began



- 7 -
to be used in significant quantities only since the mid-1960's, up to
which time demand was less than the-capacity of Pakistan's two small
superphosphate plants (about 8,000 tpy of P20 ). At present, Pakistan
has six fertilizer plants with a total capacity of 316,000 tons of
nitrogen and 8,000 tons of P20 per annum. The largest of these are the
Esso plant at Dharki in Sind province and the Dawood-Hercules plant near
Lahore in the Puntab. Both plants produce nitrogen in the form of urea.
The Esso plant started operations in 1968/69 and Dawood-Hercules began
production in 1971/72, raising domestic production of nitrogenous fer-
tilizers to 254,000 nutrient tons in 1972/73. However, in the same year,
imports of nitrogenous fertilizer and P 205 amounted to 132,000 and 40,700
nutrient tons respectively.
25.       Based on likely crop patterns and crop forecasts, Pakistan's
demand for nitrogen is estimated to double from 430,000 tons in 1973/74 to
875,000 tons in 1980/81, while over the same period the demand for P20R
is estimated to rise 3.5 times, from 60,000 tons to 220,000 tons. Takfng
into account the Multan project and another proposed urea project sponsored
by the Fauji Foundation, local production of nitrogen and P205 is projected
to grow from 281,000 tons and 9,000 tons respectively in 1973/74 to
697,000 tons and 124,000 tons in 1980/81. In other words, substantial
quantities of fertilizers will still have to be imported throughout the
period. To meet this need, Pakistan is considering other nitrogen and P 205
fertilizer projects.
26.       In 1968, the Bank and IFC helped to finance the Dawood-Hercules
(DH) urea project, a private sector joint venture between the Dawood Group
(Pakistan) and Hercules Chemicals (US), with a loan of US$32 million and
an equity investment of US$2.9 million respectively. The largest fertilizer
producer in Pakistan, the DH plant has a capacity of 620 ton per day (tpd)
of ammonia which provides 1,100 tpd of urea. It started commercial opera-
tions on schedule in November, 1971 and in its first year produced 282,500
tons, achieving 82 percent of capacity. In the first nine months of its
second year, production reached 104 percent of capacity but a temporary
reduction in the transmission of natural gas, the principal feedstock, kept
the plant's output for the year slightly above 100 percent of designed
capacity. The Dawood-Hercules plant was completed at a cost of US$84.6
million equivalent, compared with the appraisal estimates of US$78.2 million.
The overrun was caused mainly by increased customs duties and other govern-
mental levies. During the year ended October 31, 1973, the company made
an estimated profit of PRs 49 million, representing a return on 1973 share
capital of 33 percent or of 17 percent on the share capital revalued to the
original US dollar equivalent.
27.       The Fauji Foundation, a charitable trust established in 1953 for
the welfare of ex-military personnel, and operating sugar, cotton, textiles,
tobacco, food and liquefied petroleum gas enterprises, has received govern-
ment approval to set up an ammonia/urea plant in the Punjab about 40 km.
north of the Sind border. Provided the necessary financing can be obtained,
a 1,000/1,700 tpd ammonia/urea plant has been proposed. IFC is considering
a participation in the project. At IFC's invitation, U.S. Steel has expressed



- 8 -
an interest in making an investment and providing technical and marketing
assistance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed loan would help finance the expansion of the Natural
Gas Fertilizer Factory (NGFF) located in the heart of the main agricultural
region of the Punjab at Multan, now operated by the National Fertilizer
Corporation (NFC - a wholly government owned corporation) 1/. Before
approaching the Bank in 1972, WPIDC commissioned several studies by U.K.,
U.S. and Pakistani consultants on the Pakistan fertilizer market and the
expansion possibilities of the Multan plant. All indicated the need to
produce more P205 in addition to nitrogen. The project was appraised in
September/October 1973 and the Appraisal Report (No. 373-PAK) is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held
in Washington in early March, 1974. The Government of Pakistan was
represented by Mr. Aftab Ahmad Khan, the Borrower by Messrs. A.U. Loan and
Sharaf El Din and the National Fertilizer Corporation by Messrs. S. Babar
Ali, A.K. Qureshi and A. Shahnawaz. Attached as Annex III is a loan and
project summary.
Scope of Project
29.       The NGFF, with the assistance of bilateral financing, started
production in 1963. The plant comprises ammonia units with a capacity
of 260 tpd, and units for making 180 tpd urea, 200 tpd nitric acid and
300 tpd ammonium nitrate limestone. The ammonia units have never functioned
properly, thereby limiting the plant's output. The expansion project would
provide capacity for the simultaneous production of both nitrogen and P205
using natural gas from the Sui gas field and imported phosphate rock as
the main raw materials. Recently discovered domestic phosphate rock is
being evaluated and may provide the Multan plant with sufficient domestic
supplies. The existing, inefficient ammonia units will be shut down and
replaced by one large, modern 910 tpd plant that will feed a new 1,020
tpd prilled nitrophosphate (NP) unit, a new 1,500 tpd calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN) unit, and the existing urea and ammonium nitrate limestone
(ANL) units (which are being modified to produce 220 tpd prilled urea and
330 tpd granular ANL). On the basis of the ammonia plant achieving 90
percent of annual capacity, the expanded Multan plant would produce about
275,000 tpy of NP (22.5 percent nitrogen and 22.5 percent of P205), an
additional 30,000 tpy of urea (46 percent of nitrogen) and 425,000 tpy of
extra CAN (26 percent nitrogen), equivalent to about 187,000 tpy nitrogen
and about 63,000 tPy P205.
1/   In August 1973 the Government announced the reorganization of the
West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (WPIDC), the sponsor
of the Multan fertilizer project, in six separate groupings, including
a new corporation, the National Fertilizer Corporation of Pakistan
Limited (NFC). WPIDC's fertilizer operations, including the existing
Multan plant, have now been transferred to NFC.



-9-
Project Implementation
30.       The project will be implemented by a newly established company,
Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. (PFL) in which NFC has 70 percent and the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) 30 percent of the share capital, with
the assistance of a Technical Advisor team from Stamicarbon (Netherlands)
with experience in large-scale production of ammonia and nitro-phosphate fer-
tilizers. The engineers for the ammonia plant (Kellogg-U.K.), and those for
the nitric acid, NP and CAN units (Uhde-Federal Republic of Germany) have
been selected and approved by the Bank and the ADB. The Managing Director
and the General Manager (Project) of PFL have been appointed. Design started
in early 1974 and construction is expected to be completed by the end of 1976.
31.       The existing Multan plant is well-located in relation to raw
material supply and product off-take and has good road and rail communica-
tions with the rest of the province and the country. It has ample room for
expansion and is already served by a gasline from Sui (which will be
increased in capacity to 55 million cubic feet/day (MMCFD)) and the Government
has undertaken to provide the financing required for this purpose. The
management, supervisory staff and operators are experienced in most of the
technology used in the project. The plant has a labor force which cannot
be reduced because of the present labor laws, and the expansion of the plant,
while not creating additional employment, will absorb most of the present
surplus labor.
Cost Estimates and Financing
32.       The project is estimated to cost about US$94 million equivalent,
including contingencies and working capital, of which US$72 million will be
in foreign exchange. In addition, interest during construction is estimated
at US$8.0 million, of which US$6.0 million will be in foreign exchange,
bringing the total new financing required to about US$102 million equivalent.
These estimates exclude customs duties and taxes. At present, imports of
most fertilizer equipment and materials are exempt from import duties. The
proposed Bank loan and the ADB loans will meet about 60 percent of the total
financing of the project. The existing plant, which will continue to be
operated by NFC for the time being, is to be transferred to PFL by July 1,
1976. The transfer of the fixed assets included in the plant, which have a
value of US$4.7 million equivalent, forms part of NFC's share subscription
in PFL.
33.       The Bank loan of US$35 million will finance the foreign exchange
costs of Kellogg's and Stamicarbon's services and equipment for the ammonia
plant and utilities. Foreign exchange payments made before the loan is signed
will be met from share subscriptions. The loans from the ADB amounting to
US$27 million will be used for the foreign exchange cost of engineering,
erection and imported equipment for the nitric acid and NP/CAN plants. Other
expenditures will be met from the share subscriptions and local loans. All
orders over US$25,000 to be financed by the proposed Bank loan will be pro-
cured by international competitive bidding under the Bank's guidelines,
except proprietary equipment estimated at US$1 million equivalent and critical

estimated at US$4 million equivalent.   Critical items will be recommended
by Kellogg based on their experience, delivery times and competitive prices.
Domestic equipment suppliers wilL be allowed a preference of 15 percent or
the rate of duty applicable to a non-exempt importer, whichever is lower.
It is estimated that contracts amounting to about US$2 million may be won by
local firms. The loan will finance the full ex-factory cost of such
contracts.
34.       Current retail fertilizer prices in Pakistan, which are controlled
by the government, are substantially lower than world prices. Urea and
nitrophosphate sell to the farmer at US$110 equivalent per ton and CAN at
US$49 equivalent. About 35 percent of the retail price goes to the govern-
ment as a "Development Charge" to meet part of the cost of imported fer-
tilizers. Production costs for the major products of the expanded Multan
plant, including depreciation, financial charges and bags are estimated at
US$70.7/ton for nitrophosphate, US$34.8/ton for CAN and US$38.5/ton for urea.
Applying the agreement regarding the rate of return as described in para-
graph 35(a) below, a 90 percent capacity utilization reached in the second
full production year and a 12-year operating life, the project is estimated
to show a financial return after taxes of 17 percent on total project costs.
Financial and Other Covenants
35.       To assure the financial viability of PFL, the government and PFL
have agreed that:
(a)  Prices would not be set at levels which would prevent
PFL from being able to earn at least 15 percent per
annum on its paid in capital and retained earnings,
assuming efficient operation and production at
90 percent of plant capacity. PFL itself is under
obligation on its part to take all necessary action
within its power to meet this return (Section 5.09 of
Loan Agreement and Section 2.05 (b) of the Guarantee
Agreement);
(b)  Pakistan and PFL would take all necessary action to
ensure that:
(i) PFL would have a current ratio of 1.5:1 on a
defined Project Completion Date and maintain a
ratio of at least 1.2:1 thereafter;
(ii)  PFL's debt/equity ratio would not exceed 65:35
on the Project Completion Date (Section 5.09 (a)(i)
of the Loan Agreement and Section 2.05 (a)(i) and
(ii) of the Guarantee Agreement);
(c) PFL would limit further investments in fixed assets to
US$3 million equivalent a year (Section 5.06 of the
Loan Agreement);



- 11 -
(d) PFL would not incur additional long term debt if the
debt service coverage were less than 1.5 times (Section
5.05 (a) of the Loan Agreement);
(e) PFL would limit dividends to prior earnings and a current
ratio of 1.5:1 after declaration (Section 5.08 of the Loan
Agreement); and
(f) PFL would engage experienced consultants not later than
Deceniber 31, 1974 to design and implement a cost control,
accounting and management information system (Section
4.02 of the Loan Agreement).
36.       In October 1973 distribution of fertilizer in the Punjab was
taken over by the Punjab Agricultural Supplies Corporation (PASC), a
newly established, wholly government owned corporation. However, this does
not apply to Esso which has an agreement with the Central Government to
undertake its own sales, while Dawood-Hercules has obtained a concession
to distribute through its agents half of its urea production. The Govern-
ment recognizes the need for an efficient distribution network and it was
agreed that the Government would enable PFL to utilize or establish an
efficient network for the distribution of the Multan Plant. It was also
agreed that the performance of the distribution network should be periodically
reviewed by Pakistan, the Bank and PFL (Section 3.04 of the Guarantee
Agreement).
37.       To ensure farmer acceptance of nitrophosphates, a seeding program
throughout the construction period will be necessary. The Government will
use its best endeavors to import increasing quantities of nitrophosphates,
beginning in 1974, rising to 150,000 tons in 1976 when the project is expected
to be completed (Section 3.07 of the Guarantee Agreement).
38.       Large quantities of bags will be needed to distribute the project's
output. For other industrial projects in Asia it has been found difficult
to ensure that packaging materials are available in sufficient quantity.
As jute is presently not available in Pakistan, plastic-lined cotton bags
are used by the existing Multan Plant and other fertilizer plants. However,
this may not be a satisfactory permanent solution because of the
vastly increased quantities needed and possibly better alternative uses
of cotton. The Government has to make arrangements to ensure such supply
and, for such purpose, to cause a study to be undertaken, with a view to
establishing a bag-making project to supply PFL as well as other producers
of bulk products (Sections 3.05 and 3.06 of the Guarantee Agreement).
39.       To ensure that natural gas will be available in time and in the
required quantities it is a condition of effectiveness that the borrower
and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) enter into a 20-year gas
supply contract on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and that
SNGPL and the Government have made arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
for the construction of the necessary facilities to supply the expanded
Multan plant with the required gas. The Government has undertaken to provide



- 12 -
SNGPL with the necessary funds for these facilities. It is also a condition
of effectiveness that PFL enter into arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
for the supply of phosphate rock (Section 9.01 of the Loan Agreement and
Section 2.07 of the Guarantee Agreement).
40.       At present Pakistan has not yet set standards for maximum acceptable
pollution levels. However, the design of the project will complyvwith
requirements of populated areas of Europe or the USA. PFL has agreed to
adopt satisfactory standards and the Government will monitor the application
of these standards (Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.08 of
the Guarantee Agreement).
Economic Benefits
41.       The project would provide an additional source of fertilizers
which are essential both for the government's policy of self-sufficiency
in food and for continued agricultural growth, and it puts one of Pakistan's
major resources, its natural gas, to a most productive use.
42.       Since 1971 the world market situation of nitrogenous and phosphatic
fertilizers has changed dramatically from the depressed conditions of the
1960's to a situation of rapidly rising prices and shortages. Very high
price levels and severe shortages are expected to prevail during the next
few years, and the continuing rapid growth in fertilizer demand in the
developing countries expected during this decade make it imperative to
expand installed capacity substantially and as quickly as possible. This
is particularly applicable in countries like Pakistan, which has both the
major raw material and a rapidly expanding market. The project is estimated
to save Pakistan over US$50 million a year in foreign exchange and the
foreign exchange investment of about US$78 million would therefore be
recovered in less than two years. It is most probable that the economic
return would exceed 30 percent and it is unlikely to fall below 20 percent.
In addition, the project would also have unquantifiable economic benefits
in the form of building up management and training of technical personnel
at all levels.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Pakarab Fertilizers
Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(the Guarantor) and the Bank, the draft Shareholder Agreement between the
Bank and National Fertilizer Corporation (NFC), the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article Ill, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       It is proposed that the Loan should be made to the newly
established Pakarab Fertilizers Limited (the Borrower), which is to be
owned as to 70 percent thereof by NFC, an agency of the Guarantor, and as



- 13 -
to 30 percent thereof by Abu Dhabi National Oil Companty, an agency oi Žsu
Dhabi, a state of the United Arab Emirates.
45.       As mentioned in paragraph 35 of this Report the Loan Agree.c-. makes
detailed provisions as to the financial operations of the Borrowero inclLding
limits on borrowing, capital expenditures and dividend distributioi&s, provision
for the maintenance of a current asset/current liability ratio and of an
initial debt/equity ratio. In addition, the Loan Agreement provides tnat
the Borrower should take all action within its power necessary to meet o     f ox
its net sales revenues its full expenses and earn a return of 15 percent on
its equity share capital.  As mentioned in paragraph 39, the Loan Agreeme,.
contains certain conditions of effectiveness, including the mnaking of arrag-
ments for the provision of natural gas and phosphate rock, the main inputs
required by the Project facilities.
46.       Under the Guarantee Agreement the Guarantor, in addition to giving
the assurances as to the 15 percent return on equity referred to in pararvraph
35 (a) hereof, gives a full performance guarantee of the obligations of the
Borrower under the Loan Agreement and undertakes to meet any overrun in the
expenditures required for the carrying out of the Project. As mentiorned
in paragraph 38 the Guarantor also agrees to make arrangements for the
supply to the Borrower of fertilizer bags.
47.       The Shareholder Agreement (Section 3.03) requires NFC, as
majority shareholder of the Borrower, to ensure that the Borrower carries
out its obligations under the Loan Agreement. It provides for the transfer
by NFC to the Borrower of the existing fertilizer business at Multan on or
prior to Project Completion Date and for the management of the existing
plant at Multan by the Borrower in the interim (Section 3.01). Pending
transfer, NFC is required to restrict its capital expenditures at Multan
(Section 3.02). Lastly, since the National Fertilizer Corporation also
engages in other fertilizer operations in Pakistan, the Shareholder Agreement
contains a guarantee of the Loan in favor of the Bank (Section 2.01).
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. Projects in Execution!/
Loan No. 266       Indus Basin: US $90 Million Loan of September 19,
1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completod.
Some minbr remedial works have still to be finished and settlement remains
to be made on a number of claims. Further disbursement of this Loan (main-
ly for Tarbela Dam), which was interrupted in 1971 by agreement with the
United States in order to disburse first the loan contribution of the United
States to the Indus Basin Development Fund, has now resumed. Work on the
Tarbela Dam project is proceeding on schedule. The original Closing Date
of September 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 50         Education: US $8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project suffered initial delays due to administrative
difficulties, shortages of building materials, lack of local funds, the
1971 war and, more recently, extensive floods. The pace of implementation
has improved but problems of equipment procurement and shortages of building
materials remain. All construction contracts have been awarded, of which
about 76 percent are completed.   Equipment installed at the agricultural
university represents about 80 percent of the total allocation and at the
technical institutes, 90 percent of the total allocated.   The project is
expected to be completed by the new Closing Date.
Loan No. 376       Karachi Port: US $17.0 Million Loan of May 14., 196a;
Closing Date: June 30, 197M
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially. The
total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of US $37.5
million to US $47.0 million but there has beern no change in the foreign
exchange component of US $17.0 million. This increase has not materially
affected the economic justification of the project. The project was first
delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves. In 1967
wcrk had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned.   Later, it was found
that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant further
delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the delay.
The difficulties now appear to have been brought under control and the
works are now approaching completion. The dredging operations, although
more than 90 percent complete, are still behind schedule but are now being
expedited. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1969, was extended first
to June 30, 1972, and then to June 30, 197h, the current date.
v/ These notes are designed to inform the Fxecutive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan lNo . 5W      Taroela Dam; US $25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
1      losing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are expecsed until FY 1976.  Good progress is being maintained on
the project. On Septervtoer 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted through
tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage - the constiuction of the
closure section of the darm - to be undertaken.  The main civil works
co:   e-srs have subri-i-.-I-d substantial claims on account of labor costs,
inflation and the 1972 devaluation of the Rupee which are being considered
by a special Government committee.
Cr. No. 145        Telecommunications; US $16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Cr. No. 186        Telecommunications; US $15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
There have been delays in implementing both these credits.  The
original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the two credits of
about US $11.3 million in the former East Wing and US $19.7 million in the
liest. US $5.2 million of the undisbursed balance of Credit 145-PAK was
cancelled in November, 1972 after a telecommunications project to Bangladesh
was approved. The Closing Date of 145-PAK was extended from the original
date of December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1974. The Closing Date of Credit
186-PAXK has been extended from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975; and
the credit proceeds have been reallocated to reflect the increased costs of
imports resulting from the realignment of currencies. This will also allow
GOP more time for the reorganization of the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph
Department, the introduction of an effective accounting system and tihe
completion of installation of equipment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590       Development Finance Company - PICIC; US $40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 196°; Closing Date:
September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 197L, has been extended to September 30, 1975, to enable
disbursements to be made for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621       Rail.wa; US $14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
C'osing.Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead.  The change was based on a
feas-;biit- s. -tv cor!uc-t--d by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France), who indicated
th-.ta new ya-: a"-;i' i WOl.d l:, economically and operationally preferable.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6 pages
The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has been extended by tharee
years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for Pipri yard to be built and
the balance of the loan has been reallocated. PWTI has also reappointed the
consultants for a period of 18 months.
Cr. No. 157        Agricultural Development Bank: US $30.0 Million
Credit of June  6, 1969; Closing Date: December 31,
1974
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the original
schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in lending for
tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical connections were
originally responsible for this delay. The original Closing Date of
June 30, 1972, was first extended to June 30, 1974 2nd then to December 31,
1974.
Cr. No. 177        Development Finance Company - TDBP: US $20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Although IDBP has restored its organizational effectiveness, the
loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching repercussions on its
financial position. Pending a satisfactory solution of this problem, and
to enable IDBP to resume lending to industry, the unwithdrawn amount of the
credit has been converted into a Government owned fund administered by
IDBP as an agent of the Government. The original Closing Date of December 31,
1974, has been postponed to December 31, 1977.
Loan No. 696       Gas Transmission: US $19.2 Million Loan of June 29,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3 percent). The project was
substantially completed in July 1973, but to enable disbursements to be
made for retention payments and some equipment procurement, the original
Closing Date of June 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 206        Engineering Education: US $4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction of the College started in February 1974.
Civil works and equipment procurement will probably be completed before
the Closing Date but the staff development program has been slow to start
and may extend beyond that time.   The cost of the civil works is expected
to increase from Rs 16 million to Es 31 million.   But due to the devaluation
of the rupee, the credit amount will be sufficient to meet IDA's share of
this increase. However, the Government will need to provide an additional
Rs 6.7 million to make up its share.

Cr. No. 213        Power Transmission and Distribution: US $23.0
Million Credit of August 14, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Implementation of the project is now proceeding much more
satisfactorily. Contracts to the value of about US $17.0 million equivalent
have been placed. Orders for remaining equipment are expected to be placed
soon. The first consignments of equipment are beginning to arrive in
Pakistan. Some difficulty has been experienced in acquiring the necessary
sites for substations and the delivery of six 30MVA transformers has had to
be delayed.  WA_PDA is making every effort to speed up_acquisition proceedings.
The original Closing Date ol" December 31, 1974 has been postponed to
December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 398        Industrial Imports II:US $45.0 Million Credit of
