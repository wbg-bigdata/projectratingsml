F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
In the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the project development objective (PDO)
is stated as: #to support the implementation of key reform measures in the Borrower#s
economic reform program, including: (a) improving the balance between public and
private sectors through technical assistance to increase private economic activities and to
reform public sector entities and information systems; (b) improving the social
sustainability of economic reforms; and (c) supporting the implementation of the Hospital
Restructuring Program.# It should be noted that the stated objective in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) was #to accelerate the change in the respective functions of
the public and private sectors in delivering key services in Georgia#. This was followed
by a detailed description of components each of which corresponds to the various parts of
the PDO as stated in the DCA.

 1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

This project was designed in an environment characterized by: political and economic shocks;
civil unrest; armed conflicts; and, economic crisis, which demanded that the fiscal situation be
readjusted in order to re-establish macro-economic stability. Indeed, in the post-independence
period, the country lost preferential access to former Soviet Union markets and large budget
transfers from Moscow. Consequently, output fell by 70 percent and exports by 90 percent in
1989. This was the worst decline of any transition economy, and was compounded by conflicts in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 1993, which left about 750,000 people displaced; significant
physical capital destroyed; important trade routes disrupted; and the Government's authority, in
large segments of its territory, undermined. In addition, the state of a number of key sectors was
characterized by significant constraints and challenges:

  (i) The Health sector: This sector was characterized by a decline in health financing. Thus,
  although there was an increase in the scope of health services, the proportion of the planned
  health budget had declined. This resulted in a perpetual financial crisis, which was compounded
  by a surplus of health providers; high informal payments and a high percentage of unsafe and
  outdated hospitals. According to the Poverty Risk Assessment, the poor were particularly
  affected by these challenges.

  (ii) The Social sector: The social protection system was at the edge of collapse. Specifically, it
  suffered from a number of structural, institutional, policy, implementation and governance
  constraints, and faced a severe shortage of resources. These resulted in both non-payment of
  benefits and, the accumulation of substantial arrears to pensioners and social assistance
  recipients. In addition, the bulk of the poor were difficult to target, with self-selection based on
  corrupt and inefficient definitions of eligibility.

  (iii) The Public Sector: Public expenditure management was weak. This lead to large
  discrepancies between planned and executed budgets. In this environment, there was a need to
  improve the government's public expenditure management performance; anti-corruption
  strategy; public procurement reform; and, deregulation and de-licensing. In addition, although
  information on the Government's economic reforms was becoming more widely available,
  coordination of information across Government ministries and agencies was weak, as was,
  outreach to the provinces.

  (iv) The Private Sector: The scope of privatization was limited to small and medium-sized
  enterprises; and there was no enabling regulatory framework to allow for infrastructure
  privatization. In addition, partly as a result of the Russian financial crisis in 1998, the
  consolidation of the Banking sector had accelerated, and the National Bank of Georgia's (NBG)
  supervisory capabilities was stretched.

It is within the context of the sector-specific problems listed above, and in the light of the Bank
Group's strategy in Georgia, for the period 1998-2000, that the Structural Reform Support Project
(SRSP) was developed. This project aimed to support key reform measures highlighted in the
proposed Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III) and Energy Sector Adjustment Credit



                                                   5

(ESAC). In so doing, this project aimed to address severe public revenue constraints and, failure
of the public sector to provide basic needs such as electricity and health care. Project components,
therefore, addressed three of the four Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives, and were
focused on improving economic efficiency and social equity through: (a) technical assistance
(TA) in private sector development; (b) public sector reform/public information and social
sustainability; and, (c) hospital restructuring. Specifically:
      · the Hospital Restructuring and Social Sustainability components aimed to reduce
          poverty and widen access to social services;
      · the Private Sector Development and Financial Sector component sought to deepen and
          diversify the sources of economic growth; and,
      · the Public Sector Reform/Public Information component supported the CAS objective
          of strengthening public finance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
According to the DCA, the PDO was: `to support the implementation of key reform measures in
the Borrower's economic reform program, including: (a) improving the balance between public
and private sectors through technical assistance to increase private economic activities and to
reform public sector entities and information systems; (b) improving the social sustainability of
economic reforms; and (c) supporting the implementation of the Hospital Restructuring
Program.' As mentioned above in the datasheet, the PAD had a general short objective "to
accelerate the change in the respective functions of the public and private sectors in delivering
key services in Georgia". This was followed by a detailed description of components each of
which corresponds to the various parts of the PDO as stated in the DCA.. The PAD included an
extensive list of indicators. For ease of reference and review, these indicators have been
reorganized in this ICR based on the project's development objectives. Key outcome and their
associated output indicators are as follows:
    (i)   under `improving the balance between public and private sectors through technical
          assistance to increase private economic activities and to reform public sector entities
          and information systems':
                 to adopt laws and regulations, in time to attract foreign investors
                 to establish regulatory capacities
                 to improve the capacity of National Bank of Georgia (NBG) to manage failing
                 banks
                 to improve coordination and quality of information across agencies
    (ii)  under `improving the social sustainability of economic reforms':
                 to review the list of recipients and improve targeting of the poor
                 to improve the capacity available to manage and model the public pension fund
    (iii) under `supporting the implementation of the Hospital Restructuring Program':
                 to decrease the post-operative infection rates
                 to decrease informal payments
                 to decrease the number of public medical facilities (facilities sold as real estate,
                 restructured hospitals)
                 to decrease overall staffing; changed composition of staff; and, shorter average
                 length of stay in hospital

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO and indicators remained the same over the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
Most of the activities financed by this project aimed to provide benefits to the entire population.
In particular, everyone was expected to benefit from: a) improved health care services; b) the
establishment of a well-functioning pension system; c) improved infrastructure resulting from
large-scale investment in telecommunications, energy and transport; and, d) more efficient
resource allocation from a stronger banking sector. Specific advantages would accrue to:
   (i) Health care workers- through an improved working environment and a better funded
         sector (reflected in higher salaries).
   (ii) The socially vulnerable- through better targeting of benefits, and the implementation of
        workfare schemes, where feasible, to lessen the effects of wage losses due to
        unemployment, and
   (iii) The Government and the private sector- better and more competitive public procurement
         processes, together with the development of a delicensing program, were expected to
         reduce opportunities for corruption. In addition, although the original beneficiaries of the
         public sector reform component were: the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Public Procurement
         Department, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) (for licensing law), and Public Information Center,
         in a post-restructuring environment, additional beneficiaries included: the MOF treasury,
         tax and customs departments (who were expected to benefit from the rehabilitation of a
         central MOF building and IT systems) and the Government Chancellery (whose benefits
         would accrue from refurbishment of building and provision of IT systems).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
(a) Component A- Hospital Restructuring (total estimated cost- US$10.0 million): This
    component had two primary objectives: (i) to improve the efficiency of the health care system
    by reducing the number of hospitals and personnel in the city of Tbilisi; and, (ii) to ensure
    that the hospitals that remained in the public sector provided quality services and were
    financially sustainable. This component was designed to support the following key activities:
    the establishment of a revolving hospital restructuring fund (HRF); the introduction of new
    governance, organization, and management structures; and, improved risk pooling of a large
    portion of out-of-pocket spending on health care. This component included 3 sub-components
    (including base costs): (i) Hospital Consolidation (US$8.63 million); (ii) Hospital
    Operational reform (US$1.16 million); and, (iii) Project Management (US$ 0.18 million).
(b) Component B- Private Sector Development and Financial Sector (total estimated cost-
    US$4.5 million): The objective of this component was to address three of the critical
    challenges facing the privatization program and the banking sector by: (i) supporting open,
    competitive and strategic privatization of a few large infrastructure enterprises (through the
    financing of financial, legal and technical advisory services); (ii) strengthening the capacity
    of the energy and infrastructure regulatory institutions to enable strong private sector
    participation; and (iii) strengthening the supervision department and monetary policy capacity
    of the NBG. This component included 3 sub-components (including base costs): (i) Strategic
    Privatization in Large-Scale Enterprises (US$2.6 million); (ii) Regulatory Capacity (US$1.2
    million); and, (iii) Financial Sector Strengthening (US$0.64 million).
(c) Component C- Public Sector Reform/Public Information (total estimated cost- US$2.7
    million): The objectives of this component was: (i) to assist the Government in strengthening
    budget management and the institutional capacity of the MOF, and in developing a medium-
    term expenditure framework (MTEF); (ii) to support the implementation of public
    procurement reforms; (iii) to improve the licensing regime in order to make it less
    discretionary and more transparent; and (iv) to support the program of public information and



                                                  7

    public relations, with regards to economic reforms. This component included 4 sub-
    components (including base costs): (i) Public Expenditure Management (US$0.33 million);
    (ii) Public Procurement Reform (US$0.59 million); (iii) Licensing Reform (US$0.46 million);
    and, (iv) Public Information/ Education (US$1.32 million).
(d) Component D- Social Sustainability (total estimated cost- US$2.5 million): The objective of
    this component was to establish a credible and affordable safety net, through: (i) the
    establishment of a continuous information and monitoring system (capable of both tracking
    the social impact of economic developments and, supporting efforts to confirm eligibility and
    access to social assistance programs); (ii) assessment of the feasibility and desirability of
    workfare as a means of targeting assistance to the poor, including the design and piloting of
    such a scheme; and (iii) assistance to the Government in developing a pension reform
    strategy and building institutional, technical, and human resources capacity for its successful
    implementation. This component included 3 sub-components (including base costs): (i)
    Poverty Monitoring/ Targeting (US$0.25 million); (ii) Workfare Options/ Pilot (US$0.71
    million); and, (iii) Pension Reform (US$1.52 million).

1.6 Revised Components
Given the multi-sectoral and complex nature of this project, together with unexpected events such
as significant changes in the political environment, the scope and scale of several project
components were revised. This however, did not affect the overall DO. Also, no formal
restructuring took place, and no changes were made to the results framework. Thus, indicators
remained the same over the life of the project.

The Component A (hospital restructuring) was revised on 12/20/2004, with an amendment to the
DCA. In particular, approximately US$3.68 million was re-allocated from this component to
component C, in order to the support the new Government's public sector structural reforms of
the MOF and Government Chancellery. This reallocation was due to: poor performance by
component A (including low disbursements); changes in the political environment, and in
particular the Rose Revolution; and, the new post-Rose Revolution Government's distrust of the
previous Government's hospital reform design. In the restructured component C, specific
activities included: a) the reconstruction of a new MOF building to consolidate core MOF
functions such as treasury, customs and tax departments, and modernization of the MOF's IT
system (software and hardware), to include a central database and internal network; b) the
development of an IT strategy for the Chancellery; and, c) the streamlining of internal business
processes though introduction of related software as per the strategy's recommendations.

Apart from this, another sub-component, `Reorganization of the Ministry of Labor, Health and
Social Affairs (MOLHSA)' was added to component A, based on a request from the GoG that the
project's focus should be on: (a) partial rehabilitation of the MOLHSA building and (b)
procurement of equipment for MOLHSA (with the required TA assured from DFID and USAID
funded projects).

In addition, changes were also made to the scope of two of Component B's sub-components:
`strategic privatization of large-scale enterprises', and `development of regulatory capacity'. In
particular, the sub-component on privatization was substantially reduced (from $2,600,000 as
envisaged in the PAD to actual disbursements of $291,147.36) as the planned privatizations of
large-scale enterprises were delayed beyond the initial time span. In contrast, the sub-component
on development of regulatory capacity was substantially increased (from $1,200,000 as envisaged
in the PAD to actual disbursements of $3,231,632.84) in order to further support the development
of the regulatory framework. These changes were considered a necessary pre-requisite for large-
scale privatizations, expected at a later stage.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
The original closing date of this credit was 04/01/2002. This was formally extended (4 times) to a
revised closing date of 6/30/2007, due to a number of factors.
        Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, the original timeframe of this project was
        extremely ambitious- 2.5 years; this was a key reason underpinning the first extension
        from March 2002 to March 2004. This short timeframe was compounded by the Rose
        Revolution; a number of external factors, namely the Russian crisis and the bursting of
        technology bubble; the pace of reform efforts; and, low capacity in the new Government.
        Thus, for example, privatizations which were expected to occur in 1999, were delayed
        until 2005/ 2006.
        The main reasons for the second extension, from March 2004 to March 2006, was the
        political situation, coupled with an 2003 earthquake, which made it necessary to find a
        new building for the National Centre of Tuberculosis and Lungs. These factors
        significantly delayed the implementation of a number of project activities.
        After March 2006, two further short extensions occurred (from March 2006 to Dec 2006
        and, from Dec 2006 to June 2007) because of a number of delays. For example, the
        public sector reform/ public information component faced delays which were initially due
        to: a) turnovers in the beneficiary organizations, particularly at the management level
        following the 2003 Rose Revolution, and b) a lack of implementing capacity. The latter
        contributed to delays in fulfilling procurement procedures. Also, with a change in
        Government after the Rose Revolution, Government performance under the public sector
        component shifted dramatically. Specifically, activities were restructured to focus on both
        civil works improvements for the MOF and Chancellery and, the upgrading of IT systems
        for these institutions. Although the Government took ownership of these new activities, it
        quickly became evident that it lacked the capacity necessary for their timely and efficient
        implementation. Thus, civil works were delayed, and the procurement and installation of
        IT systems took much longer than expected because of the Government's inability to
        prepare a clear strategy for implementing IT reforms.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
This project directly supported major Government and CAS objectives and hence was
strategically relevant. Also, given the strong link between SAC-3 and ESAC, the activities
envisaged were well coordinated with other IDA-financed activities. Brief background
information on the project, including relevant sector work, and the project's design are discussed
below. This will be followed by a brief summary of the project's preparation, design and quality
at entry.

(i) Background: Project Preparation
The design of this project was based on SATAC I and SATAC II funding, and included a risk
assessment; a considered evaluation of alternatives; and, secondary data from reports such as the
`perceptions of health reform' stakeholder analysis, in order to assess the social impact of reform
efforts. This was complemented by the decision to use existing expertise in implementation
arrangements, as discussed in sub-section 2.2 below. In addition, this project also built upon
previous sector work and TA in areas closely related to project activities. Specifically:



                                                 9

       · The Georgia Health project provided a good foundation for work on hospital
          restructuring, and much of the preparatory work was funded through prior TA credits.
       · The Bank had done significant work in the energy sector, and had worked closely with
          EU-TACIS       and    USAID,     in    examining     options   for  privatization of   the
          telecommunications companies and Poti port. In addition, the Bank had also worked
          closely on banking sector issues, through for example, ongoing sector work and TA in
          response to the Russia crisis.
       · Previous TA and policy advice helped to frame the discussion on key issues in the anti-
          corruption action plan, such as procurement and licensing reforms.
       · A Poverty Assessment carried out in 1998 helped to shape the Government's thinking
          on the need to focus on the socially vulnerable.

(ii) Project Design
Four alternatives were considered for the project's design. These however were rejected, and a
design was chosen which focused on four key sectors- the public and private sectors, the social
sector, and the health sector. Specifically, the alternatives considered were:
     a) To split this `project' into 2 credits (hospital restructuring, and a stand-alone TA credit)-
        this was rejected on the grounds that it would reduce ownership both horizontally and
        vertically amongst implementing agencies.
     b) To implement hospital restructuring in regions other than Tbilisi- this was rejected on the
        grounds that restructuring is both slow and difficult. Hence, it should proceed in a phased
        manner, starting in Tbilisi.
     c) To restructure other types of facilities (ambulatories, polyclinics, and san-epid stations),
        instead of hospitals- this was rejected for 2 reasons. Firstly, it was held that since
        hospitals consume a large share of resources, they are better candidates for efficiency
        gains. Second, it was posited that hospital rationalization can help to solve the problem of
        excessive service delivery. In so doing, much needed funds would be provided for capital
        investments.
     d) To leave large scale privatization to other donors- this was rejected because of the
        Government's desire for the Bank to `take the lead', and coordinate with other donors.

In this design, although the PDO was clearly linked with project components, these components
were diverse, and had little or no relation to each other. The result was a complex and ambitious
project design, which was prepared within a tight timeline of 2-3 months, in order to retain the
IDA fund allocation. Unsurprisingly, little attention was placed on M&E. This is reflected in the
absence of baselines and targets for a number of indicators; the imprecise definition of a number
of indicators, coupled with loose linkage between indicators and component activities; and, the
establishment of inadequate monitoring arrangements.

These shortcomings in the project's preparation and design were compounded by the project's
unrealistic timeline of 2.5 years; this can help to explain some of the implementation challenges
and project extensions which subsequently arose. Also, although a number of potential risks were
considered, the potential for opposition to the hospital restructuring component, from political
parties, and/ or the general population, was not highlighted as at least a significant risk. This
might have encouraged active thinking on possible risk minimization and mitigation strategies.

(iii) Summary
No formal quality at entry assessment was done by the Bank. However, this ICR rates the
project's design, preparation and quality at entry as moderately unsatisfactory. Although, the
design of individual components was supported by a significant amount of previous sector work,



                                                  10

coupled with risk assessments, and careful consideration of alternatives, the project suffered from
its omnibus design; short preparation time; and its overly optimistic timeline.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

This project's implementation was plagued with delays (as noted in sub-section 1.7 above), and
was also affected by two key factors which were beyond the remit of the project. Firstly, and
perhaps most importantly, the domestic political environment became increasingly difficult, and
as a consequence, weakened support for the overall reform agenda. For example, when hospital
restructuring became a very politically sensitive issue, a proactive decision was made to move
restructuring outside of Tbilisi. Second, the global economic downturn from 2001 onwards
reduced interest in economic reforms such as the privatization of large-scale enterprises. This had
a direct negative impact on the private and financial sector component, where interest in areas
such as telecommunications and energy waned.

In exploring this project's implementation, three key areas will be briefly discussed: (i)
implementation arrangements; (ii) the project's restructuring and, (iii) the findings of the project's
MTR. This will be followed by a brief summary of factors affecting implementation and
outcomes.

(i) Implementation Arrangements
Two agencies were responsible for managing different aspects of this project: (a) the Health
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was responsible for the largest component- Hospital
restructuring; and, (b) the SATAC Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the Ministry of
Trade and Foreign Economic Relations was responsible for the other three components. This
implementation arrangement was designed to make the best use of existing institutional
resources, and, build ownership. For example, the PCU was considered to have a comparative
advantage in: procuring medical equipment, hospital civil works and TA for hospital specialists.
Meanwhile, the PIU had already successfully implemented the Institution Building Credit (IBC),
which closed in June 1998, and was also responsible for managing SATAC II, and two IDF
Grants. In spite of this, however, two key challenges faced by both agencies during project
implementation was a lack of adequate capacity and, coordination problems between these
agencies and their respective Ministry counterparts.

(ii) Mid-term Review
The MTR was originally scheduled for 2001, but was postponed to 2002 due to Sept 11th events
in the US and Government reshuffling in the Fall of 2001 in Georgia. During the MTR, only one
component- hospital restructuring, was rated as unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, the performance of
activities under component B was deemed to be positive, and most of the activities relating to
component C were assessed as being `on track'. That said, the Bank declined the Government's
request to extend the funding of the Economic Reform Public Information Center (under
Component C), on the grounds that it was inappropriate. Also, although the pension reform
activities (under component D) were carried out, it was decided that the implementation of the
associated pension reform plan would require a project extension. In addition, the delivery of the
beneficiary assessment was postponed, and the Bank accepted the Government's proposal that the
workfare sub-component (a key activity under the social sustainability component) should be
transferred from the SRS project, to the Social Protection Reform Project.




                                                11

(iii) Project Restructuring
In the post-Rose Revolution environment (post-2002), the change in Government resulted in a
change in the focus of a number of component activities. For example, under the hospital
restructuring component, focus shifted largely from hospital restructuring towards: (i) the revision
of the Hospital Master Plan (HMP), and its implementation strategy; (ii) rehabilitation and
equipping of 2 TB hospitals, and (iii) implementation of a public information campaign, which
was aimed to both inform the general public and healthcare providers about the goals and
progress of reforms in the hospital sector, and build support among key beneficiaries. Under the
public sector component on the other hand, although most of the priorities remained unchanged,
the new Government decided to use funds, which were reallocated from the hospital restructuring
component, to support new activities that were not envisaged under the original component
design. This was previously noted in sub-section 1.7. Despite these changes in project design, no
changes were made to the results framework.

(iv) Summary
No QAG assessment of supervision was done during project implementation. However, this ICR
rates the project's implementation as moderately unsatisfactory. Indeed, although the expertise of
existing agencies was exploited, these agencies were unfortunately constrained by limited
capacity. This had a significant influence on the delays experienced by a number of activities. In
addition, one key flaw during implementation was failure to modify the project's results
framework to reflect changes in the scale and scope of project components. M&E during
implementation is discussed further in sub-section 2.3 below.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(i) M & E Framework and Design
The PAD identified 17 outcome and output indicators that could be used to measure project
success; these were organized by component. For 50% of these, no targets were set. Whilst most
indicators reflected project objectives, some indicators were found to be loosely aligned with
project activities. Thus, there was no clear results chain between inputs and outputs/ outcomes.
This was compounded by the fact that several indicators (associated with the hospital
restructuring and private sector development components in particular) were poorly constructed,
in the sense that they were unclear, difficult to measure and/ or multi-directional.

For example, under the private sector sub-component, one indicator aimed to: `improve strategic
investment in sectors.' Although the PAD makes reference to the intended benefits of this process
(to sustain long-term growth in sectors such as telecommunications, transport, energy), the scope
of this indicator was too broad to be effectively monitored. Conversely, the indicator to: `improve
capacity of NBG to manage failing banks' captured only a narrow aspect of the intended
objective, to improve the capacity of the central bank's supervision department. In addition, while
it is difficult to directly attribute the change in indicators such as hospital infection rates and
informal payments, to specific hospital restructuring project activities, indicators such as `change
in the composition of staff' or `decrease in staff' were vague in the sense that they did not
expressly articulate the staff being targeted.

(ii) M& E during Implementation
Challenges in the scope and the design of a number of indicators were compounded by limited
tracking of indicator-data in a systematic manner. Thus, with regards to the health restructuring
component, for example, it was assumed that component-activities would improve health services
and quality of care, and, as a consequence, have a positive impact on indicators such as `hospital
infection rates'. Direct indicator-monitoring, therefore, was deemed to be unnecessary. On the


                                                  12

whole, it was not until the mid-2005 supervision mission that some indicators were actively
monitored.

Apart from this, following the informal restructuring of the Project (and significant reallocation of
funds from the hospital restructuring to the public sector component), no change was made to the
M&E framework. For example, although there was a movement away from actual hospital
restructuring activities, as previously noted in sub-section 1.6 above, no change was made to the
framework. Instead, the original output and outcome indicators remained in-tact, despite changes
in the direction of the post-Rose Revolution Government. This is problematic since an overall
assessment of the M&E framework may have provided the task team with important information
(and leverage) to assess performance, and resolve delays (or cancel activities) in a more efficient
manner.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(Focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Adequate safeguard and fiduciary compliance mechanisms were put in place and, during
implementation there were no procurement or FM issues/ problems. In addition, all audit reports
were unqualified, and, project accounting and internal controls were adequate.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The GoG is currently implementing a radical optimization plan, which involves some elements of
the original HMP. This plan, which involves the privatization of about 70-80% of hospitals in the
country, along with the construction of 23 new hospitals in Tbilisi (100 in total in Georgia, with
those older than a certain age being sold), has been significantly influenced by the experience of
the SRS project. Apart from this, a number of other operations and lending instruments have
followed the SRS project, and are in place to support the health sector, the public sector, and the
socially vulnerable. Specifically, three successive PRSO annual operations (which began in 2005)
support the implementation of the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP or
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program). For operational purposes, the PRSO
program is focused on improving four key areas of reform: (i) public sector accountability,
efficiency, and transparency; (ii) electricity and gas sector services; (iii) the environment for
private sector development; and (iv) social protection, education and health care services. In
addition, a PRSO IV operation will soon be submitted to the Board, and will focus on, inter alia,
the targeted social assistance program.

Also, with regards to the Public Sector Component, the implementation of the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was initiated under the 2006 budget, and is supported by a
Public Sector Financial Management Reform Project. Public sector activities therefore, such as
procurement reform, through the strengthening of the independence and effectiveness of the State
Procurement Agency (SPA), remain a priority for the Government. In addition, the Bank
continues to work with the Government to revise and improve the State Procurement Law and the
most recent SPA amendment- strengthened SPA independence, by developing a report line
directly to the Prime Minister rather than to a ministry. This action was recommended by the
Bank's procurement team. In addition, licensing reforms, which were initiated under the project,
have continued and expanded. As a result, there has been a decrease in the activities which are



                                                 13

subject to licensing, and the time needed to obtain licenses (for building a warehouse) has been
dramatically reduced from 282 days to 137 days. This has resulted in a decline in costs of more
than 50%.

In addition, while the Public Information Centre was initially moved from the Chancellery to the
Office of the President, as expected under the project, this centralized office was abolished
following the creation of the new Government. Thus, at present, Government information efforts
are decentralized to the ministry level. In spite of this, however, public access to information on
government policies remains weak.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objective of this project was and remains relevant to the country priorities and Bank
strategies. In particular, the current CAS (2005), and the July 2006 mid-year review, highlighted
major weaknesses in health care delivery, and pointed to the need for optimization. This situation
has underpinned the GoG's current implementation of a radical optimization plan, which involves
some key elements of the original HMP. With regards to component B, although large-scale
privatization is no longer a key priority, following the major privatization thrust in 2005 and 2006,
both privatization, in specific areas such as energy, and, the development of institutional capacity
in public sector institutions, as a key to effectively supporting economic growth, remain priorities
in the CAS. Apart from this, the state program is committed to providing social assistance, and in
August 2006, 85,000 extremely poor households received cash benefits. Moreover, the relevance
of targeting the socially vulnerable groups, and the Government's commitment in this regard, is
reflected by the increase in recipients. In 2006, targeted social assistance was delivered to 85,000
households, while in 2007 targeting increased by approximately 141% to 120,000; this represents
12 percent of total Georgia's households and 38.7 percent of all poor.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The achievement of the PDO will be discussed with reference to the project's three key
objectives:

(a) `Improving the balance between public and private sectors through technical assistance to
increase private economic activities and to reform public sector entities and information
systems'

This objective was monitored by the following 5 outcome indicators:
    (i)    Laws and regulations in place in time to attract foreign investors: this target was
           achieved, as independent regulators were established for both energy and
           telecommunications (telecoms).
    (ii)   Establishment of regulatory capacities: this target was achieved, as both the energy and
           telecom regulators demonstrated regulatory capacity by, for example, adjusting tariffs
           on a timely basis.
    (iii) Improved capacity of NBG to manage failing banks- in the absence of a clear target, it
           is impossible to assess whether this target was achieved. In spite of this however, it is



                                                   14

           clear that this has been positive change. This is reflected by improvement in banking
           supervision, due to both an increase in the number of trained staff; and upgraded IT
           equipment.
    (iv) Department of State Procurement (MOE) fully operational and fulfilling its functions:
           this target was achieved.
    (v)    Improved coordination and Quality of Information across agencies- this indicator was
           not achieved. Although there was some early success, there was little improvement in
           coordination in the post-rose revolution environment.

In summary, envisioned privatization of GEC, TG and Poti Port did take place, and TA activities
have helped to strengthen the institutional and regulatory capacity of key Georgian regulators.
This has contributed towards the DO by strengthening regulatory institutions in order to promote
strong private sector participation. In addition, progress has also been made in consolidating the
banking sector, and, the purchase of IT equipment for the NBG has helped to strengthen the
supervision department and monetary policy capacity.

With regards to public sector activities, in the pre-Rose Revolution period, the reform of public
sector entities and information systems (in order to improve the balance between public and
private sectors) was on course to achieve many if not all of its objectives: (i) public expenditure
procedures were reformed leading to a decrease in arrears and the introduction of the MTEF to
provide more strategic budgeting; (ii) the Public Procurement Department was reformed into an
independent Agency to improve its effectiveness and efficiency (with continuing World Bank
assistance); (iii) the licensing regime was simplified through legislative reform and the creation of
a single licensing window, leading to a significant decrease in both the number of procedures and
the time needed for enterprises to receive required licenses (as measured by the Doing Business
data); and, (iv) the Public Information Center was centralized in the President's office in an effort
to improve operations. With the change in Government after the Rose Revolution, however, the
focus of this component changed in order to reflect the new goals of the post-Revolution
Government. Specific changes included improving facilities and IT systems in the MOF and
Chancellery. Despite delays, however, progress has been made towards the achievement of new
objectives; MOF operations for example have been consolidated into a single building and an
automated document production system has been developed for the Chancellery. In spite of this
however, the new Government has also reversed the centralization of the Public Information
Center. This unfortunately has lead to diffused and uneven provision of public information on
government policies.

Based on the above discussion, the achievement of this objective is rated as moderately
satisfactory. Specifically, 3 out of 5 key outcome indicators were successfully achieved, with 1
indicator partially achieved. Although large-scale privatization was untimely, it did take place,
and the activities funded under component B have made a number of clearly positive
contributions towards increasing institutional capacity, in a number of independent regulatory
agencies in Georgia. In addition, despite delays, a number of clearly positive changes have
occurred under the public sector reform/ public information component.

(b) `Improving the social sustainability of economic reforms':

This objective was monitored by the following 2 outcome indicators:
    (i)    List of recipients are reviewed and targeting improved: This target has been achieved.
           In particular, pensioner lists have been cleared through both the introduction of new
           registration mechanisms and an improved MIS system.



                                                 15

    (ii)   Improved capacity to manage and model public pension fund- This target was partially
           achieved, due to changes in the direction of the new Government.

Under this objective, poverty monitoring and targeting, as reflected by a new Targeted Social
Assistance Program was improved. In particular, support was provided to the State Department of
Statistics (SDS) in order to improve their sampling methodology, their address books and survey
tools. More importantly, the poverty measurement methodology was revised and improved and,
poverty data has been recalculated according to this methodology. Based on this, monitoring
results have been reported on an annual basis, and this information has been disseminated to the
Government of Georgia (GOG), as well as, other relevant stakeholders (NGOs, donors, civil
society).

Also, although by end-2003, the Borrower had taken decisive steps to introduce individual
pension accounts and move gradually towards the Non-financial Defined Contribution (NDC
system), the post-Revolution Government was hesitant to introduce this new system as planned,
despite the development of both necessary institutional capacity in the State United Social
Insurance Fund (Pension Branch) and the existence of approved legislative framework.
Nevertheless, a pension reform strategy has been formulated, and pension arrears have been
cleared, with none accumulated since 2004. In addition, pensions have also been distributed on
time. In addition, although the pension strategy has not been associated with improved capacity to
manage and model the public pension fund, as originally envisioned, this is linked to the fact that
the post-Rose Revolution Government abolished all laws which required pension modeling.

The achievement of this objective is rated moderately satisfactory. In particular, poverty
monitoring and targeting has improved; a pension reform strategy has been formulated, and one
workfare, `on the job training' program has been developed.

(c) `Supporting the implementation of the Hospital Restructuring Program':

This objective was monitored by the following 6 outcome indicators:
    (i) Decrease in post-operative infection rates: this indictor was not monitored, and is not
         associated with either a baseline or target.
    (ii) Decrease in informal payments in Tbilisi hospitals- Although no target was set, this
         indicator shows positive change. Specifically, informal payments declined by 16%, from
         45.5% to 29.5%.
    (iii)Decrease in the number of public medical facilities (facilities sold as real estate,
         restructured hospitals) - This target was partially achieved. Although the number of
         public hospitals declined by approximately 10 % in 2006, the Government started a major
         privatization thrust in February 2007. Currently, all public hospitals are in the process of
         being privatized, and it is anticipated that only 5 hospitals will remain in the public
         domain.
    (iv) Decrease in overall staffing in Tbilisi- Although no target was set, if an assumption is
         made that this indicator refers to doctors and nurses in Tbilisi, then this indicator shows a
         positive change. In particular, staffing decreased by approx 16%.
    (v) Changed composition of staff in Tbilisi: Although no target was set, if an assumption is
         made that this indicator refers to the doctor: nurse ratio in Tbilisi, then this indicator
         shows a negative change; the ratio decreased from 1: 0.93 to 1: 0.79.
    (vi) Shorter average length of stay in hospital- Although no target was set, this indicator
         shows positive change- the ALOS decreased by 33.6% (ALOS decreased from 11.44 to
         7.6 days in 2006).



                                                  16

For all of the indicators above, except one, no target was set. Consequently, it is only possible to
comment on whether these indicators experienced positive or negative changes. With this in mind,
4 indicators experienced a positive change- there was a decrease in the ALOS, overall staff levels,
informal payments, and the number of public medical facilities. At the same time, the indicator
monitoring `changed composition of staff' experienced a negative change and, indicator on post-
operative infection rates was not monitored.

Apart from the status of these pre-defined indicators, it is important to highlight that despite the
target of indicator (iii) above, 62 medical facilities (27 hospitals and 35 PHC facilities) were
restructured between 2000 and 2004, and the Government is currently engaged in a major
privatization thrust. Apart from this, business plans and analytical studies (such as a revised
HMP) have been developed in the post-Rose Revolution period. These are being used as
templates in going forward, and perhaps more importantly, have significantly influenced the new
wave of health sector reform currently taking place in Georgia. Indeed, the activities which took
place under this component, have served as a catalyst in the systematic-thought process towards
the new wave of health services improvement, and hospital optimization. For example, the
original HMP has played a key role in this process, and the HRF, which was developed under this
component, has been integrated into the Georgia Health and Social Projects Implementation
Centre. Thus, it is now responsible for monitoring and implementing the Government's Health
Sector Modernization Program.

In the light of the status of the outcome indicators outlined above, coupled with the positive
externalities of this project, the achievement of this objective is rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Whist there have been no clear efficiency gains from components B, C and D, some efficiency
gains were made under the Hospital Restructuring Component. That said, although the ICR
author could not find any related information on the actual hospitals assisted and restructured
under this project, there have been efficiency gains in the health sector as a whole, in Tbilisi.

Specifically, one aim of this component was to reduce excess capacity, by increasing the bed
occupancy rate (BOR), and decreasing the ALOS. Thus, it was assumed that if the occupancy rate
was increased to 70% (from 36.5% in Tbilisi), a more efficient hospital size of 300 beds was put
in place (taking into account economies of scale and quality of services), and the ALOS was
reduced by 20% (from 11.44 in 1999 to 9.152 days in 2006), then an optimal number of hospital
beds would be 3300. In spite of this assessment, however, it was considered excessive and
unfeasible to reduce capacity by more than 70%. Thus, it was decided that the number of beds in
Tbilisi should be reduced to 4400; these would be spread over 12 hospitals.

In reality, the BOR has increased by 5.7%, from 34.5 in 1999 to 40.2% in 2006; the number of
beds has decreased by about 18%, from 8870 in 1999 to 7197 in 2006; and, reductions in the
ALOS have exceeded expectations, with a 33.6% decrease (from 11.44 in 1999 to 7.6 days in
2006). These changes, although less than expected in the case of the BOR and number of beds,
have undoubtedly had a positive impact on improving overall hospital efficiency.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                  17

Based on sub-sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 above, the overall outcome rating of this project is
moderately Satisfactory.

The PDO of this project was and remains relevant to the country's priorities and Bank strategies.
For example, while the relevance of the hospital restructuring component is clearly reflected in
the GoG's current, radical optimization plan, which involves some key elements of the original
HMP, both privatization (in specific areas, such as energy), and the development of institutional
capacity in public sector institutions, remain priorities in the CAS. In addition, the state program,
and in particular, assistance to the socially vulnerable remains a key priority of the Government.
This is reflected in the Government's decision to increase its targeting in 2007.

With regards to the achievement of the PDO, whilst the first two objectives were both largely
achieved, the third objective was less successful. That said, however, half of these indicators-
ALOS, overall staff levels and informal payments, did experience a positive change.

Finally, with regards to the efficiency of this project, although it can be argued that funds were
not used in a reasonable timeframe, there has been an improvement in the efficiency of health
services.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
This project has helped to strengthen the poverty measurement framework in line with
international standards. Thus, it now provides a more accurate and reliable measurement of
poverty. Based on this improved methodology, poverty data for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005
have been recalculated, and the 2006 data will apply this new methodology. In addition, the new
Government has also succeeded in developing a proxy means test. This was introduced in 2006,
and this targeting mechanism, along with its associated database have been used to identify the
beneficiaries of both the health insurance system for the poor, as well as, subsidies relating to
electricity, transportation, gas and education. Thus, the Government has managed to improve its
social assistance program, and in 2007, the GoG committed 99 million GEL to this program.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Under the hospital restructuring component, business plans and analytical studies have been
developed; these include a revised HMP along with assessments of human resource needs in the
health sector. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, component A activities have
significantly influenced the new wave of Government reform in the health sector, and the HRF is
now responsible for monitoring and implementing the Government's Health Sector
Modernization Program.

Under Component B, a number of regulatory institutions, such as the Georgian National
Electricity Regulatory Commission (GNERC) and the Georgian National Commission on
Communications (GNCC) have been strengthened, at a time when they were considered to be
particularly vulnerable. Meanwhile, under Component C, a number of activities for the MOF and
the Chancellery were improved. That said, the sustainability of these will depend on consistent
budget support to both maintain the renovated buildings and manage the updated software
systems. Annual budget outlays, therefore, will be required to cover the cost of: financial and




                                                 18

human resources; and, either trained IT staff in the MoF and Chancellery or outsourced service
contracts, in order to promote the continued use and maintenance of the new software systems.

With regards to the social sustainability component, institutional capacity has been developed in
the State United Social Insurance Fund (Pension Branch)- necessary equipment has been
procured, software has been developed and tested, and relevant training has been carried out. In
addition, through the development of a proxy means testing methodology, the State Social
Assistance and Employment Agency (SAESA) has been established. This agency was heavily
supported by TA, provision of required equipment and capacity building of human resources. At
present, the SAESA possesses a database of 400,000 poor households, which are evaluated and
ranked based on a welfare score.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Although noted above, it is worth emphasizing that this project has resulted in a number of
positive externalities. In particular, analytical studies and business plans relating to the health
sector has been developed, and the project helped to improve the institutional capacity of the
GNERC and GNCC; the latter outcome was not explicitly envisioned at the time of appraisal. In
addition, the audit of the Agrobank which was funded by the project revealed that the bank was in
better financial shape than was widely believed to be the case. This has helped to ensure its long-
term viability.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Under component A- hospital restructuring, four key workshops related to the project took place;
two of these were held in Dec 2005, and an additional two workshops were held in November
2006. The general objectives of the first two workshops were to present and discuss the results of
the Scandinavian Care report on: `Improvement of Hospital Governance/ Management and
Strategic Planning'. In particular, these were intended to increase understanding in this area;
review a number of governance/ management and steering models; raise awareness of capacity
building needs and discuss how these might be met; and generally brainstorm on key issues in the
Georgian context. The second two workshops aimed to discuss the HMP, and any changes in
methodology which were deemed necessary in order to revise this master plan. In addition,
hospital efficiency (including bed numbers; short, medium and long term care services; staffing
considerations); and different scenarios for revising the master plan, and any associated legal
issues were also discussed. Based on discussions and debate arising from these workshops, key
recommendations were made to the MOLHSA regarding ownership of the revised HMP and the
implementation plan; the role of the regions; medical staffing- the most politically sensitive and
difficult aspect of the Implementation Plan; and the need to introduce an HIS.

Apart from these workshops, no stakeholder workshops took place under components B, C and D.
That said however, under Component D, a beneficiary assessment on the `Impact of the Targeted
Social Assistance' is currently taking place, and the final report is expected by the end of the
year. This survey is being financed from Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) Japan
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grant.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The privatization drive in 2005 and 2006 were both swift and comprehensive. Hence, the risk to
development outcome is low. In addition, there is also a low risk that activities under the social



                                                 19

sustainability component will not be sustained. This is based on the GOG's plans to further fine-
tune the targeting methodology and the formula in order to improve coverage of the socially
vulnerable, as well as, its budgetary allocation for this in 2007.

With regards to public sector component-activities, funding currently exists for the maintenance
of building renovations and IT systems, and the draft 2008 state budget envisages about GEL3.6
million and GEL 23.8 million for the Government Chancellery and the MoF respectively under
the category of "other goods and services"; maintenance is covered under this. This budgetary
allocation is a positive sign that these activities will be continued. Hence, the risk to development
outcome is low.

Finally, although there is significant political will to restructure hospitals in Georgia, as reflected
in the Government's decision to embark on a radical optimization program, hospital restructuring
remains controversial. Indeed, although the Government is now stronger than it was in the past,
there remain vested interest groups (such as clinicians) who oppose the reform agenda. This
opposition, coupled with the absence of proper regulations (of the private market) renders the
sustainability of reform efforts under this component questionable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The design of this project was based upon a fairly significant amount of previous sector work and
technical assistance in areas closely related to project-components. In addition, a risk assessment
was conducted, project alternatives were considered, and existing expertise was employed in
order to implement strategies in an effective way.

However, the overall project design was ambitious (2.5 year timeline) and complex, with
components and activities that were largely disjointed. This design can be linked to the fact that,
in an environment in which Georgia's IDA allocation could be lost, a decision was made to put
money into a `jumbo project'- the SRS project. This complex project design was compounded by
the fact that project preparation was hurriedly done in approximately 3 months. Short cuts were
therefore taken, and these resulted in significant short-comings during project implementation.
For example, as noted in sub-section 2.3, an effective M&E system was not developed. This is
reflected by, for example, the loose coherence between project components and their associated
indicators. Also, with regards to hospital restructuring, there was a significant overestimation of
the political will to effect hospital reform activities, and an underestimation of the potential for
resistance.

In summary, bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as MU because weaknesses in
preparation had a significant impact on project implementation, and in particular, on some of the
challenges that subsequently arose.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




                                                   20

Supervision missions were regular, and staff was very committed to the project. Thus, despite
changes in local counterparts, due to the change in Government after the Rose Revolution, the
team maintained constant policy dialogue, and was very responsive to the needs of the post-
revolutionary Government, in order to push the reform agenda forward. This is reflected in the
PRSOs 1, 2 and 3, along with the proactive identification of opportunities. Under component B
for example, a decision was made to refocus efforts on developing institutional capacity in
independent regulatory agencies, in light of the fact that privatization attempts had effectively
stalled.

Despite this, however, the team composition changed several times over the course of this project.
This served to dilute accountability and continuity. In addition, although the project fell within
the remit of two units- PREM and ECSHD, robust multi-unit supervisions did not take place.
Specifically, given the diverse nature of project components, there was some difficulty
assembling supervision teams, with adequate representation from both sectors, across all 4
components. This situation is reflected by the fact that the two key actions remained the same
between 1999 and 2004, and monitoring was somewhat spotty. Initial supervision for example,
did not include significant review of the public sector component, notwithstanding delays and
problems arising in other components. In addition, since few management comments were made
pre-2005, it can be inferred that there was little management guidance in project implementation
activities. This would have been particularly important post-2003, when the political environment
changed significantly. Despite this, however, it is important to note that supervision reporting
improved considerably in late 2004, and no further delays of agreed action plan under the public
sector component for example were observed, as the team was able to address delays by
beneficiaries, in a timely manner.

With respect to M&E, the quality of supervision was poor. Specifically, an effective M&E
system was not developed and there was little or no use of M&E indicators. This made it difficult,
if not impossible, to accurately assess change over time, and if necessary, to develop effective
mitigation mechanisms for poorly performing indicators. For example, although the hospital
restructuring component changed significantly, post 2004, there was no official restructuring,
despite changes in the direction of the post-Rose Revolution Government. This situation was
compounded by the fact that the speed at which the project was restructured, post-2004, appears
to have limited the team's ability to evaluate the capacity of the institutions involved in
implementing new reforms and activities. For example, the envisioned capacity appraisal of the
new Government's ability to implement new activities, within an agreed timeline, did not take
place. In this regard, although there was cognizance of severely limited implementation capacity,
the team faced internal pressures, within the Bank, to continue all IDA-funded activities in
Georgia. Consequently, the need to complete project activities, provided a thrust towards multiple
project extensions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Bank was very responsive to the needs of Georgia. This is reflected by the fact that the
project developed in the context of the CAS, and was extended 4 times, as previously noted in
sub-section 1.6 above, due to constraints faced during project implementation. In addition,
adequate fiduciary and safeguard mechanisms were put in place.

However, overall Bank performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory, because there was
insufficient attention to detail particularly during project preparation, despite cognizance of
potential risks. This was compounded by an underestimation of the project implementation period
and the importance of political will in areas like hospital restructuring and an overestimation of


                                                 21

Government capacity in, for example, the public sector reform/ public information component.
With regards to the latter, although supervision teams were aware of the existence of severely
limited implementation capacity, following the revolutionary change in government, they faced
internal pressures within the Bank, to continue all IDA-funded activities, because of concern that
Georgia might have difficulty receiving future IDA credits. Consequently, project activities were
continued and timelines extended, despite the fact that initial project results may not have
warranted this flexibility. Finally, as already noted, M&E during project implementation was
weak.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In assessing Government performance, it is important to consider that this project spanned 2
Governments with different goals; these differences lead to informal project restructuring in late
2004. Despite this, however, Government performance in both preparation and implementation is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory. This is based on its performance in the four project
components, which are discussed below.

(i) Hospital restructuring
Pre-restructuring, this project became highly politicized, and was adversely affected by political
opposition to hospital restructuring. As a result, reforms were put on hold in the capital, and the
government took proactive steps to shift the reform agenda outside of Tbilisi. Undoubtedly, this
unfavorable environment was compounded by both the over-ambitious scope of the project, and
an overestimation of both Government capacity and political will. Also, although the Government
was cognizant of the need for `buy-in' from key groups of stakeholders, such as clinicians, the
implementation of a planned communications campaign, did not materialize due to political
opposition, as well as, diminished support for the Government from the general populace.
Consequently, limited objectives were achieved before the start of the Rose Revolution.

In the post-Rose Revolution period, the political party which strongly opposed hospital reform
efforts formed the ruling party. Thus, despite cognizance of the need for hospital reform, their
pre-election promises to stop the reform, as well as their mistrust of the old Government,
informed their decision to: a) revisit the reform design and b) seek innovative technologies, which
it was felt would `guarantee' optimization, whilst at the same time minimize the risk of both
opposition and failure. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, although the overall objectives
of the restructuring reform agenda have been retained, the Government has shifted responsibility
for hospital closures and staff redundancies, from the public to the private sector. Also and
perhaps more importantly, 4 of the 6 outcomes under this component have either been achieved
or show positive change.

(ii) Private Sector Development and Financial Sector
Up to end-2003, there was a lack of progress in the privatization sub-component. This partly
reflected both a difficult external environment, and, limited political will. In contrast, in the post-
Rose Revolution period, the drive towards privatization was stepped-up and a very rapid
privatization program was launched, which included both privatizations that were originally
envisaged under this project, and, capacity building at the central bank.

(iii) Public Sector Reform/Public Information
Prior to the Rose Revolution, the Government made significant progress towards implementing
the activities under this component. Specifically, the procurement office was formalized and


                                                 22

given a level of independence; implementation of the licensing law took place; and the
Information Office was centrally located in the President's office and began to coordinate public
information on government economic reforms. Changes in financial management systems,
however, were `postponed' until the change in government following the Rose Revolution.

(iv) Social Sustainability
Up to end of 2003, the Borrower took decisive steps to introduce widening of pension accounts
and gradually moved towards NDC system. In this regard, although the necessary institutional
capacity was developed, and the necessary legislative framework was approved, the post-
Revolution Government was hesitant to introduce the new system as planned. Rather, the new
Government decided to focus on developing short and medium term plans related to the
improvement of the pension system. In addition, although the `old' Government failed to
accelerate work on improving the targeting of social assistance, the new Government succeeded
in developing advanced targeting mechanisms for, inter alia, poverty cash benefits based on the
proxy means testing. This was introduced in 2006, and resulted in the abolishment of all cash
benefits, which were previously targeted on a beneficiary category basis. As a result, the targeting
of poverty cash benefits was unified. In addition, this targeting mechanism and the associated
database have been used to purchase health care services, together with electricity, transportation,
gas and education subsidies for the poor. In addition, the targeting formula for the inclusion of
poor is also currently being revised based on specially designed survey findings.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

As previously noted in sub-section 2.2 above, project components were implemented by two
agencies- the PIU and PCU, due to the varied scope and nature of project activities. Each agency
was responsible for its own fiduciary and procurement responsibilities.

Although these agencies possessed existing expertise in implementation activities, their efforts
were constrained by both limited capacity, and the highly politicized environment. These factors
resulted in few planned activities taking place in either a timely or effective manner, under the
hospital restructuring component. That said, however, in a post-restructuring environment
however, capacity was less of an issue for the PCU, and new tasks (which were set out by the
post-revolution Government) were accomplished in a timely and efficient manner.

Like the PCU, the PIU also suffered from insufficient capacity within their key Government
counterpart- the MOF. Thus, while initial activities such as public expenditure reform, was
carried out in a timely manner, with satisfactory input and participation from the MOF, the
rehabilitation of the MOF building and the development of IT systems were plagued with delays
and substandard work. The primary reason for this was a lack of capacity within the MOF. An
inter-related challenge therefore faced by implementing agencies, was their `chain of command'
with other key stakeholders. Thus, in the case of the PCU for example, there were often
coordination and communication challenges with the MOLHSA and the Government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
It is clear that the Borrower was committed to this project, and its intention to effect change was
reasonable. This is reflected in the successful achievement of a number of project activities, under
all components. These achievements have been highlighted under sub-sections 3.2, and 5.2(a)
above. For example, under the private sector development and financial sector component,
envisaged privatization did take place; regulatory capacity was improved, and the financial sector


                                                 23

was strengthened through improved capacity. In addition, although health sector optimization did
not have the intended impact on hospital restructuring, post-2004 activities were successfully
completed, and there were positive changes in informal payments, ALOS, the number of public
facilities, and the overall staffing level.

Also, although the activities under the Public Sector Component were on course to achieve many
if not all of its objectives, the direction of change shifted in the post-Rose revolution environment.
Specifically, the goal of centralizing information coordination within the Government was
dropped and an emphasis was placed on civil works and IT systems improvement. Under
component D, poverty monitoring and targeting was improved, and a more focused and effective
pension strategy was developed. In addition, although no capacity was developed to assist in the
management and modeling of the public pension fund, an `on the job training' program was also
developed last year. Finally, although the implementation agencies exploited existing expertise,
they were constrained by limited capacity, and communication challenges with Ministry
counterparts.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

 (i)     Careful project preparation is essential and should not rushed, particularly for
         ambitious and multi-sectoral projects: In projects which aim to strengthen institutional
         capacity, and in which there is significant risk, there is a need to ensure that adequate
         time is set-aside for project preparation activities, such as the development of an effective
         M&E system, and ensuring that projects are streamlined with existing experience.
         Although the PAD for example, highlighted the need to focus on lessons learnt from
         similar projects, and actually listed some of the key issues that should be considered,
         these were not given due cognizance at the design stage. For example, whilst the need to
         avoid overly-sophisticated and complicated projects was noted, the SRS project was not
         only extremely ambitious, but, in some sense, was also experimental in terms of the
         reform agenda proposed.

         With this in mind, and given the dynamics and uncertainty surrounding the
         implementation of public sector reform projects, due cognizance should be taken of key
         lessons learnt from similar projects, and a premium placed on clear and logical designs.
         Indeed, the latter can help to make the sequencing of reform activities and
         implementation strategies more manageable, and in so doing, help to simplify monitoring
         and supervision. This is particularly important in the case of hospital restructuring for
         example, which is accepted as being a lengthy, complicated and politicized process.

 (ii)    Assign adequate resources to multi-sector projects: One of the concerns highlighted in
         this project, was the absence of robust, and coherent, multi-sector planning activities and
         missions. Indeed, although this project was designed as a `jumbo' project, which was
         made up of 4 components, each component operated like a single and independent project,
         once project implementation started. Given this, there is a need to ensure that projects
         which span multiple sectors are linked by a coherent thread, adequate budgetary
         allocations are assigned to individual sectors, and there is clear and accessible leadership
         for the entire team. In addition, the continuity of task teams should be prioritized, in an
         effort to promote both clear accountability and transparency, and to ensure that
         relationships with counterparts are strong and consistent. In the absence of the latter,




                                                   24

       mechanisms should be developed which ensure that institutional memory exists beyond
       the involvement of individual project-members.

(iii)  Prioritize M&E Activities: M&E is essential in order to track indicators and assess their
       performance. In so doing, it will be possible to make necessary changes, such as re-define
       indicator-targets in line with reality `on the ground', or modify indicators so that they are
       closely linked with activities. In order for this process to take place effectively, however,
       outcome and output indicators must be tightly constructed and linked with both baseline
       and target data. In addition, it is also very important that due cognizance is taken of the
       information system that underlies the M&E framework. Finally, supervision missions
       must take their responsibility to monitor and report back on progress toward attaining
       agreed indicators during the life of a project very seriously.

(iv)   Ensure that the Political Mapping is appropriately assessed: In designing projects,
       there is a need to ensure that full cognizance is taken of the political environment
       (political will and political ownership). This will ensure that project outcomes, and
       project designs are both practical and feasible. This mapping is particularly important in
       projects which involve public sector reform, since these are often associated with a high
       risk of political fall-out. This was confirmed by reaction to hospital optimization, and
       also, by the fact that regulatory development in the telecommunication and energy sector
       in Georgia, like in other Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, was found to be difficult,
       complex, and slow. Consequently, there is a need to emphasize the importance of
       political will. Projects therefore should be tempered by local realities, such as the time
       and prerequisites, needed to effect changes such as hospital optimization and large-scale
       privatization.

(v)    Prioritize Public Information Campaigns: In projects which involve public sector
       reform activities, such as hospital restructuring, the importance of effective and far-
       reaching public information campaigns, cannot be underestimated. This is particularly
       critical before the start of reform activities, in order to promote `buy-in' and ownership of
       change activities. In this process, although specific and targeted focus should rest on the
       stakeholders who will be most affected by the change, an effort should also be made to
       obtain `buy-in' from champions in key stakeholder groups.

                             Component A: Hospital Restructuring

Sub-component A1: Hospital Consolidation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Four main activities were to be financed by this sub-component: a) the development of a Hospital
Restructuring Fund; b) remodeling and equipping facilities; c) the development and
Implementation of Human Resources Programs and d) a public Information campaign. Post 2004
however, this was also expanded to include: (a) revision of the hospital master plan, (b)
improvement of hospital governance and management, (c) rehabilitation and equipping of TB
facilities and (d) implementation of Public Information Campaign. Of the post-reallocation
amount, US$3.1 million (93.6%) was disbursed under this sub-component by end-project.

(a) Development of a Hospital Restructuring Fund
The HRF was established in 2000 by presidential decree in order to facilitate privitization, human
resources restructuring, and the investment process. It was expected that this fund would have a
budget of more than US$50 million from the sale of hospitals. Notably, the restructuring was
planned in 3 phases: 2000-03, 2004-06 and 2007-10. In the first phase, which focused on Tbilisi,
the aim was to: lease 7 hospitals; sell 27 as real estate, turn 5 into housing for nurses or geriatric
nurses, and leave 12 as publicly owned hospitals in Tbilisi. In reality, while there are now 46
public hospitals, and 8 have been sold, it is not clear how many have been leased, and none have
been converted into homes for nurses and geriatric houses. That said, it is important to recall that
these results have been influenced by the fact that in a politically tense environment, reforms
moved beyond Tbilisi. On the whole, 62 medical facilities (legal entities) were restructured
between 2000-2004, among them 27 hospitals and 35 primary health care facilities. In addition,
after the merging of medical facilities, staff optimization was carried out in 9 facilities.
Consequently, 801 personnel were laid off and received compensation packages amounting to
801,427 GEL in total. In addition, 2,004,747 GEL was allocated for rehabilitating and equipping
hospitals.

Although liquidation of the HRF was on the agenda in 2003, based on recommendations and
advice from the Bank, it was later decided that this fund should be retained as a key vehicle to
support further hospital sector restructuring, and in late 2006, during a wave of substantial
reorganization, a decision was made by MoLHSA to: (i) merge the HRF with GHSPIC, and (ii)
give it responsibility for the State Investment program, which possesses a budget of 54 million
GEL for 2007.

(b) Remodeling and equipping facilities
The aim of this activity was to rehabilitate 3 facilities: (i) M. Iashvili Children's Central Clinical
Hospital, (ii) Scientific­practical Center of Infectious Pathology, AIDS and Clinical Immunology,
and (iii) National Centre of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases. With regards to the latter,
however, a serious earthquake in 2002, destroyed the building selected for the National TB center
and damaged Center of Infectious Pathology, AIDS and Clinical Immunology, and significantly
delayed the preparation of the architectural and functional designs. In addition, temporarily
relocating facilities and services whilst the TB hospital was being refurbished, proved to be very
problematic. After lengthy discussions, MoLSHA took a decision to add a new ward block of 140
TB beds to the TB Railway Hospital and to carry out a phased rehabilitation and upgrading of the
TB Railway Hospital after moving both patients, and parts of the medical services, temporarily to



                                                 27

the new Ward Block. The World Bank agreed to finance the design and the construction of the
whole project, as well as, the cost of rehabilitation of the TB Railway Hospital, the construction
of a new Kitchen/Laundry Unit and necessary site works. The construction of the new Ward
Block and the supply of medical equipment however, were financed by the Government. Notably,
the World Bank was not supportive of a decision to build new premises for the National TB
Center, given the significant hospital over-capacity which already existed in Georgia.

Apart from this, due to slow implementation of this sub-component, a decision was made by the
new Government to transfer resources, US$3.68 million, under the category "civil works", to
component C. Due to this reallocation of resources in 2004, from $4.13 million to $0.52 million,
the rehabilitation of facilities (i) and (ii) above, was cancelled. The remaining resources were
sufficient only to partially rehabilitate two existing TB facilities- the TB hospital in Kutaisi and
Abastumani. Both of these contracts were completed as planned.

(c) Development and Implementation of Human Resources Programs
The HR component focused on 4 main areas: (i) refinement and selection of the final options for
the transition process; (ii) development of new processes regarding, for example, staff
appointment, transfers, contracts and performance agreements; (iii) assistance with the transition
process (for example, notice requirements and timing); and, (iv) development of an HR strategy
for the sector.

In the first phase of the reform, the consolidation process in Tbilisi aimed to downsize hospital
staff. In reality, 1000 persons were made redundant, with 639,469 GEL was used to provide
severance payments. This amount represented 11.42% of the total revenue of the HRF. For
example, following the lay-off of staff from the Gudushauri hospital, following the merger of the
Institutes of Ophthalmology and Neurology, US$100,000 was provided for the severance
packages of redundant staff. Later, however, hospital restructuring and, in particular, the process
of HR downsizing became a politically sensitive issue and was challenged in the courts. Thus,
post-2003, further activities were discontinued, and the revision of the national HMP by Conseil
Santé included a revision of the HR strategy.

(d) Public Information Campaign
The implementation of the public relations program relating to hospital restructuring, by the pre-
Rose Revolution Government faced great difficulties. Specifically, the information delivered by
the Government was not accepted by the public due to both their major distrust of the government
in general and, anticipated social consequences of the proposed reform, which was fuelled in part
by the Opposition party, who succeeded in highlighting negative consequences of the reform
agenda. Hence, the reforms became highly politicized. In particular, in response to opposition
claims, information on the benefits of the hospital restructuring process was not used to promote
`buy-in' among the general population.

In 2006, however, the GoG re-initiated the PR campaign in order to inform the general public and
healthcare providers about the new wave of hospital reform, in an effort to encourage `buy-in' on
the potential benefits of these changes. In this regard, media materials for two target groups and
two media clips for the general population have been developed.

(e) Revision of HMP
As noted in sub-section 3.2 above, a decision was made to revise the HMP under this sub-
component end-2004, in order to ensure that it was relevant. In this process, a considered
assessment was made of both the challenges faced, and successes achieved under the original
HMP. In addition, this review also involved updating the implementation strategy. This review


                                                 28

was prepared by the consultancy firm, Conseil Santé, and has been accepted by the GoG. Notably,
the original HMP played a key role in this report.

Sub-component A2: Hospital Operational reform
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Although the original amount allocated to this sub-component at appraisal was US$1.16m,
103.6% of the post-reallocated amount- US$0.32 million, was disbursed. There were 2 main
activities envisioned under this sub-component:

(a) Hospital Governance, Organization and Management
At the beginning of the project, USAID and SIDA supported the development of this activity, and
after restructuring, the consultancy firm `Scandinavian Care' was contracted to explore the
`Improvement of Hospital Governance/management in Georgia'. This formed the basis of a
report, which was provided in January 2006 and accepted by the GoG in May 2006. These report
findings, in areas such the improvement of the regulation system, accreditation /licensing system,
and the legal framework have been used during the preparation of documents regarding Hospital
Reform in Georgia.

(b) Improving Equity of Health Care Financing
This activity was not initiated between 1999 and 2004, and post-restructuring, it was dropped.
Instead, emphasis shifted to the PHC Development Project, which was focused on developing the
DRG payment system.

Sub-component A3: Project Management
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Although the original amount allocated to this sub-component at appraisal was US$0.18 million,
90.5% of the post-reallocated amount, US$1.43 million, was disbursed. Notably, project
management was the responsibility of the PIU, which later became the Georgian Health and
Social Project Implementation Centre (GHSPIC). Although adequate fiduciary and safeguard
mechanisms were adopted, this unit was constrained by limited capacity, in terms of quality and
quantity of staff, as well as, the position of the GHSPIC in the `chain of command'. The latter
often meant that this agency had little autonomy to affect changes.

Sub-component A4: Reorganization of the Ministry (MOLHSA)
Rating: Satisfactory
Although not originally planned, US$0.22 million was allocated to this sub-component. Of this
amount, 100.9% was disbursed, in order to facilitate: (a) partial rehabilitation and (b)
procurement of equipment. Notably, the partial rehabilitation of the MOLHSA building, and the
installation of equipment (IT/LAN and other Equipment for MOLSHA) were both completed in a
timely manner, during the first quarter 2006.

                Component B: Private Sector Development and Financial Sector

Sub-component B1: Strategic Privatization of large-scale enterprises
Rating: Satisfactory
The aim of this sub-component was to support the privatization of: a) the Georgia Electrical
Communications (GEC) and Telecom Georgia (TG), through the financing of advisory services
for the Privatization Policy Unit at the Ministry of State Property Management, and b) Poti port.
These outcomes were both achieved.




                                                 29

Sub-Component B2: Regulatory capacity
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The aim of this sub-component was to provide funding for numerous advisory and training
activities, as well as, a limited amount of IT equipment for a number of regulatory bodies mainly
in the energy and communications sectors. These activities have succeeded in strengthening the
institutional capacity of a number of key Georgian regulators:
  (a) Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC) and Georgian International Gas Corporation
      (GIGC)- the GIOC was supported in negotiating agreements with foreign governmental
      authorities, oil companies, pipeline companies and investors, and, helped to finance
      advisors on the legal, financial and economic, negotiations, and technical aspects of the
      negotiations;
  (b) GNERC - this sub-component funded a number of consultants for the GNERC, to
      strengthen and extend its role, beyond electricity regulation towards the regulation of gas
      transport and distribution. Thus, despite great difficulties and strong opposition, GNERC
      was able to maintain its credibility and independence due in part to both strong legal
      underpinnings and the competence and credibility of its directors. In so doing, it was able to
      adjust tariffs in a timely basis, and help ease the overall macroeconomic burden faced by
      the energy sector;
  (c) GNCC- the program supported the recruitment of a legal advisor, as well as the
      development of a national ICT strategy in cooperation with UNDP, and an international
      technical expert. Overall, support for the GNCC took place at a critical time; just after the
      GNCC had been established by the Georgian Law on Telecommunication and Post of 1999,
      as an independent regulatory authority. This helped to establish the GNCC as a credible and
      competent independent regulator.

Apart from the above positive changes, however, it is important to note that there were also minor
shortcomings. For example, whilst the objective of this sub-component was to establish
regulatory capacities and put regulations in place, in order to attract foreign investors, the latter
did not happen.

Sub-component B3: Financial Sector Strengthening
Rating: Satisfactory
This sub-component provided funding in two areas:
a) International auditing of the accounts of Agrobank- although this former state-owned agro-
industry bank (which included 69 branches) was privatized in the mid-1990s, its financial
position was uncertain. Given this, along with the fact that the liquidation of this Bank was earlier
set as conditionality by the IMF, but this was never done, a premium was placed on determining
the true financial condition of this bank. The audit of this Bank therefore was a priority, which
surprisingly revealed that the Bank was in a better financial state than expected. These findings
helped to dissipate doubts about its long-term viability. In this regard, significant benefits accrued
to Georgia as a whole, beyond those that were initially envisaged.
b) Apart from this, IT equipment was purchased for the National Bank of Georgia's supervision
department.

In effect, therefore, the operations under this sub-component achieved their pre-defined
objectives: to improve the capacity of the central bank and to strengthen the financial sector in an
efficient way. This was complemented by a reduction in the number of banks. This decline in the
number of banks was accomplished in a context of increased confidence in the banking sector (as
reflected by rapidly rising deposits) and a strengthening of the balance sheets of existing banks
(as concluded by the FSAP mission in February 2006). In addition, the latest FSAP update



                                                 30

concluded that the financial system is generally sound, and that the performance of banks and the
resilience of the system, as a whole, have improved in recent years.

                    Component C: Public Sector Reform/ Public Information

Sub-component C1: Public Expenditure Management
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The aim of this sub-component was to provide assistance in order to: (a) strengthen the process
and techniques of budget formulation and execution; and (b) strengthen the institutional capacity
of the MOF, in order to enable it to function more effectively, and fulfill its mandate with regards
to the formulation and execution of budgets.

This sub-component helped to improve the allocation and effectiveness of both the budget
management process and, the use of public resources. For this purpose, the MTEF was introduced
by the MoF in 2005, in order to introduce a strategic phase into the budget planning cycle. In
addition, the full refurbishment along with the consolidation (including the integration of the
databases of several divisions) of all structures within the MoF into a single facility, helped to
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal processes and procedures. In addition,
refurbishment works were completed, although these were plagued by delays which led to a
number of extensions of the project closing date.

Apart from this, equipment was provided to: a) the Treasury Service to operationalise the
Treasury Single Account; and b) the Customs Department in order to install the ASYCUDA
World software in the Customs Department. In addition, MoF personnel were also trained in
project management, financial management and procurement issues.

Sub-Component C2: Public Procurement Reform
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The aim of this sub-component was to provide TA, in order to strengthen the Public Procurement
Department under the Ministry of Economy, as well as, extensive training and sensitization
workshops, in order to facilitate and support the rapid implementation of procurement reforms.

In the light of this, this sub-component succeeded in amending the Law on State Procurements, in
order to extend its coverage to state owned enterprises (SOEs), strengthen independence of the
State Procurement Agency (SPA), and streamline procurement procedures. In addition, a national
training strategy and program for public procurement was developed, equipment was purchased
for the SPA, and study tours on the procurement reform experience in Poland, was conducted for
the SPA staff. This was coupled with a working visit to the WTO office in Geneva on GPA
Accession.

Sub-Component C3: Licensing Reform
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This sub-component focused on providing TA to the Ministry of Justice, in order to implement a
new and simplified discretionary licensing regime, based on a new Law on Licensing.

Consistent with the objective of this sub-component, effective licensing was introduced, and the
law on Licensing and Permits was amended, in order to dramatically reduce the activities that
were subject to licensing. In particular, related procedures were streamlined through the
introduction of a `single window' principle. In addition, a study on administrative barriers to
investments was done in 2002. This led to the development of an action plan. In spite of this



                                                31

however, the number of licensing abuse complaints was not monitored. Hence, it is not possible
to assess whether or not this was positively affected by project activities.

Sub-Component C4: Public Information/ Education
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Under the proposed credit, this sub-component was designed to provide assistance (financing of
foreign TA to the Unit; newspaper, television and radio coverage, along with advertising, on a
scaled back basis; and limited training for Georgian journalists) to the Public Information Center,
which resided within the State Chancellery, and which was responsible for developing programs
aimed at improving information dissemination to the population, on economic reforms. As a
precondition for this support, the Government agreed to move the Public Information Center from
the Government Chancellery to the Office of the President, in order to make it a government-wide
department.

Under this sub-component, government communication on reforms was improved through: TV
programs, public opinion polls, social advertisements on the radio, and organized seminars for
journalists on ongoing economic reforms. However, following the Rose Revolution, the new
Government's decision to decentralize government information services, by taking the Public
Information Center out of the President's Office, led to a lack of information coordination and a
decrease in the quality of information services. Apart from this, an IT Strategy was developed for
the Government Chancellery, in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its
operations. This included an automated document preparation system, along with the equipment
needed to operationalise this. In addition, the public entrance area, and main elevators of the
Chancellery, was also refurbished.

                               Component D: Social Sustainability

Sub-component D1: Poverty Monitoring/ Targeting
Rating: Satisfactory
Although the basic foundation of a poverty monitoring system was already in place through the
State Department of Statistics' (SDS) Survey of Georgian Households, this sub-component aimed
to support the continued improvement and implementation of the survey, as well as, greater
outreach and dissemination efforts. In particular, the activities covered under this sub-component
focused on support for: (a) the on-going Survey of Georgian Households; (b) the dissemination of
poverty monitoring results and (c) information collection on the impact of policies through
beneficiary assessment of vulnerability recipients.

The project assisted the Government in developing, and further improving, the regular poverty
monitoring system. In particular, support was provided to the SDS in order to improve their
sampling methodology, as well as, their address books and survey tool. More importantly, the
poverty measurement methodology was revised and improved, and poverty data was recalculated
according to this methodology for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005; data for 2006 is in currently
being done. Apart from this, monitoring results have been reported on an annual basis, and
disseminated regularly to both the Government of Georgia (GOG), as well as, other stakeholders
(NGOs, donors, civil society).

Also, since the new Targeted Social Assistance Program was introduced in summer 2006, the
Government has recently initiated the first monitoring study to assess both the impact of the
targeted mechanisms/formula on the well being of the target population, and, the effectiveness of



                                                 32

the health insurance program on the poor. The results of this study are expected to become
available in late January 2008.

Sub-component D2: Workfare Options/ Pilot
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The aim of this subcomponent was to finance a number of activities, which would assess the
feasibility of using workfare programs (which aim to reduce poverty by providing low-wage
work to those who need it) in Georgia. In so doing, it was hoped that the Government would be
provided with several alternative design and financing schemes. Planned activities included:
appraisal of the feasibility of a workfare scheme; design of key program features including
eligibility criteria for sub-projects and recipients, wage rates, geographical location, financing
mechanisms, institutional and governance structure and evaluation mechanisms; evaluation of
cost-effectiveness of proposed scheme(s) and comparison with other safety net interventions;
assessment of the impact of this scheme on the wage earnings of participants and non-
participants; and, design of detailed action plan for implementation of pilot scheme. Depending
on the outcome, it was anticipated that a pilot program would be launched in the second year of
implementation, with the results of this evaluated at the end of the pilot.

One of the actions taken by the Georgian government to address the problem of unemployment
was the introduction of an on-the-job training program in August 2006. Private businesses were
invited to hire `interns' selected through the program for a three-month period. The internships
were paid for by the state, and took place from September through December 2006. In particular,
from a total budget of 24 million GEL, the program provided interns with a monthly `stipend' of
150 GEL (that is, a total of 450 GEL over the three months of the program). Overall, according to
the Social Assistance and Employment State Agency (SAESA), 4,736 businesses took part in the
program, and offered 68,197 traineeships. Although there were 76,387 applications, 54,303
individuals were matched to businesses. Of these, 44,471 received internship agreement letters.
Notably, most businesses sought to provide training for low-skill and office support positions:
janitors and cleaners, insurance and advertising agents, product distributors, security guards, shop
assistants/sales staff, waiters, heavy lifters, and press distributors.

Sub-component D3: Pension Reform
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The aim of this sub-component was to provide financing for: (i) the development of a pension
strategy, and associated regulatory and supervisory framework, and TA in the establishment of
appropriate institutions, and associated training needs; (ii) development of an information
management system, including a database on the current stock of pensioners and introduction of a
personal identification number/individual account; (iii) TA in developing actuarial modeling and
in the establishment of a pension analysis unit; (iv) support for the introduction of international
accounting standards for pensions, including provision of training and equipment; and (v)
evaluation of disability certification practices and measures to improve these, including if
necessary, assistance in drafting amendments to legislation and implementing regulations.

Under this sub-component, a strategy for long term-pension reform was adopted, and
corresponding legal framework for affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection of the
elderly against poverty was enacted. In addition, the pension system was simplified and
streamlined: a flat old-age pension, payable to all citizens of Georgia upon reaching certain age
was introduced; rules for disability and survivor's pensions were simplified; pension insurance
contributions were abolished and pensions financing transferred to the general budget and special
merits pensions were greatly reduced and capped.



                                                    33

Apart from this, targeted social assistance (TSA) was developed and its payment to beneficiaries
commenced in August 2006. The introduction of TSA marked the completion of the following
major tasks: (i) development and enactment of the legal framework; (ii) development of targeting
mechanism (proxy-means formula), including conducting a special round of a household survey;
(iii) development of implementation mechanism; (iv) establishment of implementation agency
(Employment and Social Assistance Agency); (v) staff training; (vi) introduction of sophisticated,
automated information management system; (vii) design of the benefit delivery system; and (viii)
implementation of the application, eligibility testing and benefit award process. In this regard,
TSA has established a live, automated database containing more than 40% (400,000) of Georgian
households. Each single household was thoroughly examined and accordingly assigned a `score
of need'. This database is being used to target various programs for the poor and vulnerable,
including a health insurance program. In addition, in 2007, the Government is planning to
increase its coverage to about 120,000 to 130,000 extremely poor households in Georgia, with
resources allocated in the 2007 Budget. This number corresponds roughly to the extreme poverty
incidence. As of January 2007, 100,000 households were regularly receiving the TSA. At the
same time, the Government is preparing to evaluate the TSA program, through amongst other
things, a comprehensive household survey beneficiary assessment. The objective of this is to
evaluate the effectiveness of targeting, adjust the formula to the changed social and economic
circumstances (as well as the implementation mechanism if necessary), and define performance

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

(if any)
Under component A- hospital restructuring, four key workshops related to the project took place;
two of these were held in Dec 2005, and an additional two workshops were held in November
2006. The general objectives of the first two workshops were to present and discuss the results of
the Scandinavian Care report on: `Improvement of Hospital Governance/ Management and
Strategic Planning'. In particular, these were intended to increase understanding in this area;
review a number of governance/ management and steering models; raise awareness of capacity
building needs and discuss how these might be met; and generally brainstorm on key issues in the
Georgian context. The second two workshops aimed to discuss the HMP, and any changes in
methodology which were deemed necessary in order to revise this master plan. In addition,
hospital efficiency (including bed numbers; short, medium and long term care services; staffing
considerations); and different scenarios for revising the master plan, and any associated legal
issues were also discussed. Based on discussions and debate arising from these workshops, key
recommendations were made to the MOLHSA regarding ownership of the revised HMP and the
implementation plan; the role of the regions; medical staffing- the most politically sensitive and
difficult aspect of the Implementation Plan; and the need to introduce an HIS.

Apart from these workshops, no stakeholder workshops took place under components B, C and D.
That said however, under Component D, a beneficiary assessment on the `Impact of the Targeted
Social Assistance' is currently taking place, and the final report is expected by the end of the
year. This survey is being financed from Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) Japan
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grant.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

In 1999, the Government of Georgia and the World Bank signed the Development Credit
Agreement to implement the Structural Reforms Support Project for the total project cost of
12,200,000 SDR. The objective of the proposed credit was to a) improve the balance between
public and private sectors through technical assistance to increase private economic activities and
to reform public sector entities and information systems b) improve the social sustainability of
economic reforms; and c) support the implementation of the Hospital Restructuring Program. The
Hospital Restructuring Program is being implemented by the Health PCU. The PIU is involved in
the implementation of structural reforms, which were financed under the total cost of the credit
and presented 6,650,000 SDRs. The following components had been implemented before the
Rose Revolution:

Component A: Hospital Restructuring
This component had two primary objectives: (i) to improve the efficiency of the health care
system by reducing the number of hospitals and personnel in the city of Tbilisi; and (ii) to ensure
the quality and financial sustainability of the hospitals that remained in the public sector. Thus,
the component was designed to support the establishment of a revolving hospital restructuring
fund (HRF); the introduction of new governance, organization, and management structures; and
improved risk pooling of a large portion of out-of-pocket spending on health care. This
component involved 3 sub-components: (i) Hospital Consolidation (US$8.63 million); (ii)
Hospital Operational reform (US$1.16 million) and (iii) Project Management (US$.182 million).
The component mainly supported establishment of the autonomous legal entity of the public law -
Hospital Restructuring Fund (HRF) with the function to facilitate the hospital restructuring
process, mobilize all privatization proceeds from the sale of the medical facilities and invest
resources in publicly owned hospitals. The HRF managed to facilitate some of the hospital
mergers in Tbilisi (TB hospital network, Gudushauri Hospital and Center for Catastrophic
Medicine, HIV/AIDS center and the Republican Infectious Disease Center) and outside the
capital as well as distributed severance packages to the redundant staff of merged and optimized
hospitals. Moreover, the fund has rehabilitated and equipped reformed service providers.
Although the progress of the reform was slow at the beginning of the project, starting from mid
2002, when Georgia entered into the new election cycle, the Hospital Sector Reform has become
a political issue. The opposition political parties managed to stop the reform by suing the
Presidential and Governmental decision to merge services, close excess hospitals and privatize.
As a result of political opposition, the reform has been put on a hold in Tbilisi, while it was
extended by the Government outside of the capital and implemented only in those regions, were
there was an informal commitment of the local authorities and the hospital administrations for a
merger.

After the "Rose Revolution", the new Government decided to revisit the Hospital Master Plan
being prepared by Shevardnadze's Government and the policy document that guided the reform
implementation. The project supported preparation of the revised Hospital Master Plan with
particular focus on the implementation related issues. The document was recommending handing
over the optimization function from public to the private management of the hospital networks.
The Government has used the revised version of the document and made decision to embark on
more revolutionary approach, such as drastic reduction of the hospital bed capacity, privatization
of ownership of over 90% of hospitals and provided that investors in exchange of the privatized
outdated and dilapidated hospital facilities will construct      new western type hospitals. The
privatization process commenced in February 2007 and by reporting period more than 80% of



                                                40

hospitals are privatized. Eventually 100 new hospitals are envisaged under the hospital master
plan, with a bed capacity of 7800 compared to 17000. Investors are required to follow the master
plan in terms of the various departments/services to be available in each hospital Only Five
hospitals in Tbilisi (Gudushauri Hospital, Iashvili Children's Hospital, National TB Center and
Republican Hospital and Gori Military Hospital will remain under the public domain. As the
government has solicited adequate resources to rehabilitate and equip all these hospitals from
other sources, there was no longer a need to use credit proceeds for this purpose as originally
envisaged by the project. Resources form this component was re-allocated to other needs.

Apart from the restructuring of the hospital sector, the Government managed to build some
capacity in operation of hospitals. Availability of grant money from USAID, Swiss Government,
and the DFID allowed the government to spare the credit proceeds and train the core group of
hospital managers, particularly at the project targeted hospitals.       The hospital management
training curriculum was developed and resources for creating the critical mass of trained health
managers made available from DFID and state budget.

The Government also managed to improve the funding of the health services. As a result public
resources are now better targeted to the poor layers of the population to improve access and
minimize close to zero out-of pocket payments for those services covered by the state. Moreover,
in-patient provider payment mechanisms were revisited. Namely per-diem payment was changed
into case based payment system and introduction of the global budgets. While institutional
improvements were introduced in the financing system, the National Health Accounts reveals the
out-of pocket payment still being the main source of funding.

Component B. Private Sector Development and Financial Sector.
a) This component among other considered development of regulatory capacity of GIOC. The
SRS credit has been used to fund several contracts between the GIOC and international
consultants to assist Georgia during negotiations on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Main Oil Export
Pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzrum South-Caspian Gas Pipeline System. The SRS funded the
following fields of the consultancy services:
Lead advisor, legal, technical, economic and financial, tariff advisors and the advisor in transit fee.
The outcome of these assignments is that the involvement of the above consultants in the
negotiation process contributed to the positive results and better terms achieved by Georgia in the
BTC and SCP project agreements.

b) The component also considered financing technical assistance and training in energy utility
regulation to the Georgian National Energy Regulatory Commission. 14 local consultants hired
under the project assisted the Commission in the following areas:
    · Price formation in the field of gas transportation, distribution and supply
    · Analysis of the situation in the electricity generation sector
    · Analysis of the results of reevaluation of main assets of Georgian power industry and its
        influence on electricity tariffs.
    · monitoring of technical economical parameters for transmission-dispatch and distribution
        for electricity sector
    · development of norms for licensing in electricity transmission, dispatch and distribution ,
        electricity generation, import and export fields
    · development of tariff methodology for electricity generated in hydro power plants

Telecommunication sector was envisaged to evolve into a broader information and
communication technology sector with elements of telecommunications, broadcasting and



                                                 41

computing, thus enabling social, educational and medical progress. The SRS considered the
enhancement of the regulatory regime in the telecommunications sector and development of the
regulator. The services of the selected company DETECON included consulting and assisting
Georgian National Communications Commission (GNCC) on the specific legal, economic, policy
and technical issues of developing the regulatory regime in the telecommunications sector,
concentrating on areas of competition, tariff policy, universal service, frequency management,
standardization and certification.

Component C: Public Sector Reform/Public Information
    · (Government Chancellery) One of the project's objectives was to enable strong private
    sector participation. In order to improve the entrepreneur climate in Georgia the commission
    for dealing with investors was set up on December 12, 2000. One of the main objectives of
    the commission was to develop a partnership cooperation between the government and
    investors and development of concrete suggestions aimed at investment promotion. The
    commission in close cooperation with FIAS carried out the diagnostic review of the
    administrative barriers aimed at improvement of investment environment. The SRS project
    allocated funds for the part of the program financed by FIAS and Dutch government. The
    study began in July 2001 and 4 local and 2 foreign consultants were hired. The mission
    visited the Poti port to study the problems faced by the consignors and export-import
    problems in general. The document was prepared in December 2001 and its presentation was
    held in February 2002. The document in detail described the barriers for business
    development and provided recommendations to improve the investment environment. The
    commission in close cooperation with the representatives of private sector prepared an action
    plan which eventually became a basis for the special order of the president of Georgia issued
    on June 8, 2002. The special order considered carrying out number of activities to develop
    and realize a consistent program for investment promotion and development of private
    business.
    · (Ministry of Finance). The project considered assistance to the Ministry of Finance of
    Georgia. The performance of the 10 local consultants who were hired for the Ministry of
    Finance of Georgia from the credit funds contributed to the preparation of favorable base for
    restructuring of external debt of Georgia within the framework of Paris Club. The
    Consultants prepared various schemes and draft agreements used during the negotiations with
    the creditors/donors.
    · (Ministry of Justice). One foreign and 5 local consultants were hired for the Ministry of
    Justice (i) review the legislation governing certification, standardization, and accreditation of
    certifying bodies to identify shortcomings of the legal framework that are to be addressed as
    the first step of the reform program; (ii) review existing institutional set up, policies and
    practices relating to certification and standardization; (iii) on the basis of the above analysis
    the scope and sequence of the reform         agenda to be pursued by the Government was
    identified. The outcome of this intervention is that the government could achieve the
    minimum conditionalities under the adjustment program.
    · (SPA) The part of SRS credit was allocated to assist the State procurement Agency of
    Georgia. The credit already financed a number of training programs and workshops to
    facilitate support and rapid implementation of procurement reform. In addition, the SPA was
    supplied with computer equipment and furniture to ensure the uninterrupted working process
    of the agency and this also benefited to the preparation and issuance to the procuring
    organizations of the booklets containing legal normative acts aimed at introduction of the
    standard bidding documentation for the international tenders. This is the output. The SPA
    hired two foreign experts who assisted the government in formulation and implementation
    of a national training strategy for procurement staff; in establishing of effective coordination



                                                 42

    mechanism with other donors in the judicial training area; assistance to the government in
    preparation of the GPA for accession the World Trade Organization
    · (ICER) From the very beginning the credit supported the public information component.
    the public opinion research assisted the government to more effectively tailor its
    communications activities to respond to public concerns and sentiment

Component D: Social Sustainability
Under the poverty monitoring/targeting component there have been the two main directions: First
the a) household survey and b) consumer barometer survey which were supported and carried out
by the Statistics Department of Statistics under the SRS project. Implementation of these surveys
would have not been possible without availability of adequate capacity at the SDS. Moreover,
results of these surveys have informed the design of the poverty reduction intervention strategy as
well as targeted social assistance strategy and methodology.

Under the same component the SRS credit allocated part of the funds to support the pension fund
reform. The technical assistance was made available for the design and development of the
package of pension laws. Namely, with the project support the laws on: "Mandatory Social
Insurance", "Mandatory Pension Insurance " and "Introduction of Individual (Personalized)
Accounting and Individual Accounts in the System of Mandatory Social Insurance" were
prepared and approved back in year 2003. These laws were prepared with the direct input of the
consultants of pension policy unit financed under the SRS. Secondly, the project supported
supply and installation of computer equipment for introduction of personal identification numbers
and individual accounts for beneficiaries. Considering that over 17% of the population in Georgia
are pensioners, the availability of the IT equipment helped to clean up the pensioner's database
and keep it updated regularly.

After the Rose Revolution the Government of Georgia re-tailored its priorities in the social sector.
Namely, the new approach the government prioritized firstly to cover arrears accumulated in the
pension payments and secondly get away in a short-term from pension insurance and more focus
on the equalization of pensions by paying flat pensions and gradual increase until the fiscally
sustainable new reform strategy is not developed. In summary the package of pension laws
approved by the previous government has been dropped and legislation amended to reflect new
Government priorities. As a result of this shift in the policy, the government managed to clean
arrears, increase flat pensions and from September 2007, introduced differentiated flat pensions
according to the work history.

In addition, to better target the poor layers of the population with the social benefits, the
Government with the World Bank's support through PHRD grant developed proxy means testing
methodology. The latter allows identifying the poor households and evaluating its economic
status. This system has been introduced since June 2006, and the Ministry of Labor, Health and
Social Assistance distributed cash benefits as well as purchases health services for almost 650,
000 poor individuals.

Reallocation of Credit Proceeds
After the Rose Revolution, the Government carefully reviewed implementation progress of the
project with the focus on activities to be implemented, financial resource requirements and
proposed reallocation of funds from one component to another in order to reflect and meet newly
emerged needs. For this purpose the DCA was respectively amended.

Approx.US$3.68 million was re-allocated from the Component D - Social Sustainability to the
Component C due to the changed political environment and GoG priorities, availability of other
funding sources that would have ensured achievement of the same component objectives.

Delays in implementation of the hospital restructuring reform due to the political opposition
before Rose revolution, coupled with the new Government's distrust in both the reform design of
the previous government and their willingness to revisit the hospital optimization strategy, the
remaining funds in an amount (US$3.68 million) was reallocated to component C, in order to the
support the new Government's (following the Rose Revolution) public sector structural reforms
of the MOF and Government Chancellery. In particular, activities included: the reconstruction of
a new MOF building to consolidate core MOF functions such as treasury, customs and tax
departments, and modernization of MOF IT system (software and hardware), to include a central
database and internal network, the development of an IT strategy for the Chancellery, and the
streamlining of internal business processes though introduction of related software as per the
strategy's recommendations.

Upon the request of the Government of Georgia SRS credit funds were re-allocated to provide
more financial support to the Public Sector Management. The part of the re-allocated funds is
considered for modernization of the facilities and equipments in the Government Chancellery and
the Prime Minister's office and development of an ICT and e-government strategy. Based the
new ICT and e-government strategy was prepared the Document Preparation System (DPS) of
the State Chancellery and the Document Presentation, Review and Control System (DPRCS) of
the Government of Georgia. Document preparation system solely operated by Organization
Department of Government Chancellery and used to prepare documents for Government
meetings. DPS allow State Chancellery to achieve the objective of streamlining the process of
document preparation between Ministries and State Chancellery. Document Presentation, Review
and Control System (DPRCS) allow State Chancellery staff to enter (using MS Word, scanning
and other sources) documents prepared in traditional way (without use of electronic DPS) into
electronic form for the review of the Government during the meetings. After implementation of
this system document preparation process (happening in Ministries, Organization and Legal
departments of Chancellery) will be left intact and only Government members will have access to
DPRCS. This allow the State Chancellery to improve document presentation and review
experience for the members of Government and will streamline the process of controlling
Government decisions related to these documents.

Rehabilitation of the Government Chancellery -the objective of the rehabilitation is to
transform the part of the government chancellery into the building satisfying the modern
European standards
The other part of re-allocated funds, besides the Government Chancellery, have been foreseen for
provision of technical assistance to consolidate the various structures of the Ministry of Finance
by introducing a unified database, networks, and analytical centre. Also the part of these funds
was used for the implementation of the big project at the Customs Department of the Ministry of
Finance of Georgia within participation of the USAID, EU, and Government of Georgia. Project
outcome was to upgrade the Customs Department Hardware and Software for up-coming
transition of Customs administration and monitoring system.

For consolidation purposes the MoF will move to a new building together with the customs and
tax departments. The physical rehabilitation of the new MoF's building also was the part of the
project activities. The Ministry of Finance with the assistance of foreign experts have prepared
the Masterplan and Design of the single central database and a reliable internal IT network The
