This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission, which visited
Zaire in November 1984, consisting of A. Ceyhan (Power Engineer, Mission
Leader), J. V. Gontier (Financial Analyst, Consultant) and S. Kalinowski
(Training  Expert, Consultant).   The mission also drew largely on the
findings of Mr. Dubois (Power Economist, Consultant) of the Energy
Assessment Mission which visited Zaire -during the same period.
Institutional and financial analyses were carried out by K. Mikitin and
E. Bundi; the energy sector chapter was written by M. Dyson; and the
economic analysis was reviewed by G. Schramm. Final version of the report
is based on the findings of an updating mission, consisting of A. Ceyhan
and K. Mikitin, which visited Zaire in March 1986.

ZAIRE
SECOND POIWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                   The Government of the Republic of Zaire
Amount:                     IDA Credit SDR 37.3 million (US$37 million
equivalent)
Terms:                      Standard
Cofinancing:                UNDP grant of US$600,000 equivalent.
Beneficiary:                Societe Nationale d'Electricit6 (SNEL)
Onlending Terms:            The Government would onlend SDR 37.2 million
(US$36.9 million equivalent) from the proceeds
of the Credits to ShEL at 8.5 percent interest
with a 20 year repayment period, including five
years' grace.   SNEL will  bear the foreign
exchange risk. UNDP funds would be on a grant
basis.
Project Description:        The project would seek to:
(a) ensure reliability of supply to the main
interconnected    networks,    by      (i)
rehabilitating the existing Ruzizi I plant
and the distribution networks of Bukavu,
Goma, Uvira and Kiliba; (ii) completing
the  rehabilitation  of  the  generation
stations and transmission and distribution
system in the Shaba Region; and (iii)
carrying out urgent maintenance works and
improving operation of the Inga hydropower
complex;
(b) make optimal use of the electric energy
within the Zaire (Kivu)-Rwanda-Burundi
interconnected system by increasing the
transmission and distribution capacity of
the electricity network in that portion of
the   Kivu   region   where   there   is
considerable suppressed demand;
(c) strengthen SNEL as an institution through
better   planning,    rational   pricing,
improved financial policies, and training
of its staff. An urban household energy
study to be supervised by SNEL on behalf
of the Government would determine the
substitutability   of   electricity   for
traditional household fuels.



Benefits and Risks:         The principal benefits of the proposed project
would result from continued use of some of
Zaire' s earlier major power investments and
from optimal use of power supplied through
Zairels interconnected networks. Completion of
the rebabilitation of the Shaba power plants
and transmission system and assistance to SNEL
in operating and maintaining the Inga I and
Inga II hydropower plants would improve
reliability of supply to the main electrified
areas and to the vital mining industry.
Pbysical risks of the project are mnlimal.  A
major risk lies in the Government's lack of
coherent policies for planning and pricing, but
by seeking advice through an Energy Sector
Assessment and committing itself to exchange
views with IDA on these subjects in the future,
the Government has demonstrated its intention
to improve in these areas.    SNEL's lack of
skilled manposer is also a risk, but this is
addressed by the provision of consultants and
training.

I. TH. ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01        Zaire is about 2.3 million square kilometers and is Africa's
third largest country.  The population of about 30.7 million is growing
overall at about 3% per year, but at about 7% in the cities where
approximately a third lives.   About three-quarters of the population
subsists on agriculture. Zaire's GNP per capita, estimated at about US$140
in 1984, is among the lowest in Africa.   Mining and mineral processing
account for a third of GDP and about two-thirds of the country' s export
earnings.
1.02      Zaire has abundant energy resources; particularly hydropower and
forests, but it also ,has some petroleum and coal, both of which are
produced in modest quantities.  Final energy consumption in 1983 totalled
about 8.6 million toe or about 280 kg of oil equivalent per capita.
Biomass energy sources (wood, charcoal, crop and animal residues) provided
for 86% of total energy consumption; about 80Z of which is used as
household energy (cooking, heating and lighting).   About 14% of total
energy consumption (or 39 kg of oil equivalent per capita in 1983) is made
up of petroleum (8%), power (4%) and coal and coke (2%). 1/
1.03      The energy balance for 1983 is given in Annex 1.1 and a summary
of estimated energy production and consumption for 1983 is provided in
Table 1.1.

The main consumer of modern energy forms (petroleum, power and coal) in
Zaire is the mining industry, which accounts for about 39% followed by
transportation (36%) and manufacturing (9%). The remaining 16% is consumed
by agriculture, commerce and private households and the Government (Table
1.2).   Consumption of petroleum products and electricity is expected to
grow at a faster pace than fuelwood, but the latter will remain the
predominant energy source in the foreseeable future.

Energy Sector Organization and Planning
1.04        The DME (D6partement des mines et de 1'energie) has primary
responsibility for formulating and implementing energy sector policy and is
charged with technical supervision of the Societe Nationale d'Electricite
(SNEL - Chapter III) and the Entreprise Petroliere du Zaire (PetroZaire -
para. 1.06); no role has yet been defined for the Ministry with regard to
traditional household energy resources which are de facto being handled by
the Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Tourism and its
agencies.  The Government has a broad involvement in the sector through
ownership in all energy enterprises (the main ones being SNEL and petroleum
exploration, refining, distribution and service companies) and ministries
responsible for pricing (Economy and Industry), investment review (Plan)
and forestry/fuelvood (Environment, Nature Conservation and Tourism).
Petrozaire holds a product processing contract with Societe Zaire-Italienne
de Raffinage (SOZIR - para. 1.07).  It also holds minority shares in the
semi-public petroleum products, distribution, marketing and service
companies (distribution: Zaire Fina, Zaire Mobil, Zaire Texaco and Zaire
Shell;  service: Zaire SEP).   The Department  of National Economy  and
Industry has authority over the prices of electricity and oil products.
The Department of Portfolio administers the Government's holdings in the
energy companies mentioned above.    The Ministry of Environment, Nature
Conservation and Tourism administers Zaire's forestry and fuelwood sector.
The National Reforestation Service (NRS) and the Center for the Adaptation
of Wood Energy Technology (CATEB) are other government units which are
related to the woodfuel sub-sector.



- 3 -
1.0c      The various energy entities have carried out their activities in
isolation from each other with no one of them having access to all the
information required to define sector policies or the capacity to implement
them. To address this problem, the Government created in 1981 a National
Energy Commission (NEC) under the DME and mandated it with coordinating the
work of all sector entities and defining a national energy policy. The NEC
is composed of officials from DME, the Department of National Economy and
Industry, REGIDESO (the water supply company) and the Service Presidentiel
d'Etudes (SeE). Lack of budgetary funds and guidance (an adviser financed
by the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) began his
two-year term in December 1985) have rendered the Commission ineffective
thus far. Definition of a technical support structure and a work program
for the NEC are under preparation and reallocation of extra budgetary funds
is proposed to launch the work of the NEC by Fall 1986.
1.06        PetroZaire was established in 1978 as an internal transport
agent. By 1984 it had acquired 5% share in the distribution of petroleum
products and had become the sole importer of petroleum products and crude.
According to its broad statutory powers, Petrozaire also has responsibility
for monitoring petroleum exploration activities; but up to now has carried
out little of its mandate in this area.
1.07      SOZIR, which is equally owned by AGIP (Italy) and the Government
of Zaire, operates Zaire's only refinery near Moanda/Banana, at the mouth
of the Zaire River. The refinery was built to process 750,000 tons/year of
imported crude but utilizacion has been consistently less.   All locally
produced crude is therefore exported and refined product needs met through
imports. Refinery operations ceased in 1984 because of a working capital
shortage among companies in the supply and distribution chain, and although
the liquidity situation has improved, a period of favorable world market
prices  for products  precluded  re-opening of  the  refinery.    A joint
Government, SOZIR and Bank position on the role of the refinery will be
developed through an IDA (PPF) financed study on the supply and
distribution system and is likely to orient SOZIR toward product unloading
and storage management for which it has facilities and expertise.
1.08       In relation to the hydropower resources it shares with Burundi
and Rwanda, Zaire belongs to two international institutions, Energie des
pays des grands lacs (EGL) and Societe  internationale d'electricite des
pays des grands lacs (SINELAC, para. 2.01).
1.09        One of the most important institutional deficiencies in the
en_rgy sector is the Government's neglect of the rational exploitation of
its biomass resources and tendency to concentrate primarily on the issues
of  petroleum resources and electric power.   In its capacity as  the
coordinating agent for various energy subsector interests, the t.EC would
give special emphasis to the problems of biomass energy.
Bank/IDA Participation in the Sector and Rationale for Involvement
1.10         The Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project (CR 1224-ZR;
April 1, 1982; US$19 milli.n) was the Bank Group's first lending operation
in  the energy  sector.   The project is cofinanced with  the Belgian
Government and CCCE.   The purpose of the project, which consists  of



- 4 -
rehabilitation of the hydrogenerators and transmission system, maintenance
and technical assistance for the Shaba region, is to ensure an efficient
power supply to La general des carrieres et des mines (GECAMINES), the main
copper mining entity, whose operations are located in Shaba in the south of
the country. The project, though initially somewhat delayed, is proceeding
reasonably well.    Although some  important  institution building  e.g.,
management organization and training, and tariff issues are being addressed
through tiiis project, the physical and financial aspects are limited to the
Shaba Region.   During the rehabilitation works, the need for repair and
replacement of equipment surpassed the special contingency provided for
this purpose; additional materials, equipment and works are therefore
included  in  the  proposed  project  to  complete  the  rehabilitation
(para. 4.05).
1.11      With Burundi and Rwanda, Zaire is participating in the Ruzizi II
Hydroelectric Project (CRs 1419-BU, 1420-RW and 1421-ZR, US$45 million,
December 6, 1983). The project is cofinanced by the European Development
Fund (FED) and the Banque de DEveloppement Economique des Pays des Grands
Lacs  (BDEGL).    The project is a joint collaboration  formed  to take
advantage of economies of scale and to lower the costs of power supply to
Burundi, Rwanda and the Kivu region of eastern Zaire. The project consists
of a concrete gravity dam llm high, a power station (2x13 MW and space for
a third), switching station and 15 km of 110 kV transmission line, housing,
consulting engineering, institutional assistance to SINELAC, and a tariff
study.  Works started about one year late on this project and the power
plant is now expected to be operational by end-1988 or early-1989 (para.
2.17).
1.12       A sector review mission which visited Zaire in November 1981 2/
was the Bank Group's first attempt to develop a comprehensive view of
Zaire's energy sector.  Subsequently, at the invitation of the Government
and in close liaison with related institutions, a Bank-UNDP Energy Sector
Assessment mission visited Zaire in November 1984. The report of the 1984
mission was discussed with the Government in March 1986 and its findings
are incorporated in this document.
1.13      The assessment dealt with overall energy institutional issues and
analysed in depth the three crucial subsectors of power, petroleum and
biomass energy.   Principal issues which characterize the power subsector
stem from the existence of questionable past investments and from
institutional  weaknesses  and  include:   xi)  surplus  generation  and
transmission capacity of the Inga I1 power station and Inga-Shaba line
(paras. 2.06, 2.22, 2.23 and 2.24); (ii) inefficiency of existing small
thermal and hydropower stations and lack of a strategy for rehabilitation
and expansion of existing generation and transmission and distribution
facilities (paras. 2.05, 2.09, 4.05); (iii) institutional strengthening of
SNEL particularly in the areas of investment planning and finance (paras.
3.13, 4.05, 5.06 to 5.09); and, (iv) lack of an analytica'lly-based set of
policies and priorities for meeting urban household energy needs (para.
4.05).   IDA's recommendations and actions taken are described in the
2/   Zaire:  Introductory Energy Sector Review. World Bank, December 1981
(green cover).



- 5 -
referenced paragraphs.  The petroleum subsector issues included:  (i) the
shortcomings of the institutional framework; (ii) petroleum exploration and
production; (iii) importation, distribution and marketing of petroleum
products; and,  (iv) the role of the local refinery.   (paras. 1.07 and
1.20).    The  household  energy  subsector  issues  are:    {i)  regional
deforestation; (ii) fuelwood supply in Kinshasa; and, (iii) cooking stove
efficiency (paras. 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24).
1.14          Many of the measures proposed to address the above power
subsector issues are included in the proposed project which was appraised
in tandem with the energy sector assessment, and supports a strategy of
assisting SNEL to ensure reliability of supply and to achieve a balanced
regional and national development of hydropower potential.   The project
proposes to rehabilitate existing power facilities in order to prevent
failure of supply and to make optimal use of the electric energy of the
Zaire (Kivu)-Rwanda-Burundi   and   Inga-Bas   Zaire-Shaba   interconnected
systems.   Its broader power subsector objectives-strengthening SNEL by
continuing  general  management  assistance  and  through  a  long-term
development plan, cost-reflective tariffs, and training--support the Bank's
traditional concerns in the power subsector, primarily better planning and
stronger financial performance. Many of the recommendations on the other
subsectors,  primarily  petroleum  (para.  1.20)  and  household  energy
(para. 1.22) are being implemented by the Government and will be supported
under future energy sector operations.
Sector Objectives and Strategy
1.15      Strategy.  The fragmentation of responsibility among numerous and
diverse agents and the absence of an effective coordinating entity have
hindered  the  formulation  of  a  cohesive  sector  strategy.    Broad  and
ambitious objectives have been stated (integration of areas of low
electricity availability and doubling of connections in Kinshasa area from
60,000 in 1984 to 120,000 by 1987, expansion of petroleum exploration,
rationalization of forestry management) without the well-conceived policies
and incentives to fully achieve them. Progress is nevertheless being made
with the adoption of a liberalized pricing policy to end the uniform
national  prices  of  petroleum  products  and  electricity  which  have
discouraged adequate supply to outlying areas.   Petroleum product prices
are now based on reference prices (similar to landed costs) plus a
distribution cost differential.   Electricitv price structure adjustments
are  gradually  decreasing   the  cross-subsidization  between  consumer
categories which benefit low voltage users, and experimentation is being
tried with differentiated tariffs for diesel and hydro-supplied power.
Quarterly adjustments for petroleum products and semi-annual reviews of
electricity  rates will keep prices in line with actual costs.   Much,
however, remains to be done to ensure reliable low cost supplies of energy
products and allocate them effectively among consumers.  To this end, the
Government recognizes that top priority should be given to strategy and
policy recommendation functions of the NEC (para. 1.05) and is following up
on the recommendations of the energy sector assessment to initiate this
work. Bank Group assistance to develop a sector wide strategy and improve
planning has been requested and is being considered for inclusion in an
energy project under preparation.



1.16  Bank Group Objectives.  The Bank's objectives can be summarized as
follows:
(i) developing the NEC as an effective agent for intra-sector
coordination, strategy development, policy formulation and
planning;
(ii) encouraging adoption of comprehensive policies for energy
pricing, leading progressively to full price-liberalization;
rational production and exploitation for energy of wood
resources; for better defining the respective roles of the
private sector and Government in energy management and
development;
(iii) preparing and agreeing subsector and sector wide investment
programs based on practicable least-cost production and
supply plans;
(iv) improving the reliability of supply, efficiency, and export
earnings of the power subsector through optimal utilization
of existing assets and rehabilitation of infrastructure,
including utilization of the surplus capacity of Inga II for
increased household, industrial and export uses;
Cv) strengthening SNEL in the areas of finance, procurement and
manpower development;
(vi) formulating a least-cost petroleum supply strategy including
the roles of the domestic refinery, transport infrastructure
and the distribution companies; and,
(vii) developing a rational framework for increasing private sector
activity in the exploitation, supply and marketing of
petroleum and wood energy resources.
These objectives are consistent with the Bank's overall strategy for Zaire
and the conclusions of the energy sector assessment (para. 1.13) and are
incorporated in the proposed project where applicable.
Energy Resources
1.17      Zaire's potential energy resources are substantial (Annex 1.2).
Among its largest indigenous energy sources is its substantial hydroelec-
tric potential of 774,000 GWh/yr.   This represents almost half of the
hydroelectric potential for the entire African continent, and about 12Z of
estimated annual hydroelectric production worldwide.   The country also
possesses oil and coal resources which are unexplored except for oil
resoucces at the coast and some coal mines in the Shaba region.  Although
the total national reserves of crude oil are not well established,
commercially recoverable crudes are estimated to amount to about 74 million
barrels. Commercially mineable beds of coal, situated principally in the
Shaba region, are estimated at 720 million tons. The country contains over
50% of the forest resources of Sub-Saharan Africa.  The mixed tropical
hardwood rain forests in the Central Basin (100 million ha) and peripheral



mixed species forests (22 million ha) form the bulk of remaining forest
reserves; however, the former Mayumbe forests (240,000 ha) in the Bas Zaire
region are close to depletion due to excessive felling. Only about half of
the remaining forests are currently accessible for economic exploitation.
Other potential, as yet unexploited, energy sources include shale deposits,
tar sands, the natural gas of Lake Kivu, and solar energy. Zaire also owns
uranium resources which have been exported  for many years.   Finally,
promising sources of geothermal energy and non-wood biomass energy have
been identified, although their full potential and the extent of actual and
potential utilization (in the case of biomass) have yet to be defined.
Energy Demand
1.18       Zaire is a net exporter of electric power (para. 2.11) and an
importer of coal and coke for the copper smelters in the Shaba region. As
shown in Table 1.1 (para. 1.03), in petroleum volume terms Zaire is a net
petroleum exporter, but in value terms the net surplus is insignificant
(para.  1.20).   Zaire currently imports all of its finished petroleum
product requirements since its own crude cannot be processed economically
in the local refinery (para. 1.07). Because of the high cost of refined
imports which increased from 3% of total imports in 1972 to 232 in 1982
(representing about 232 of total merchandise imports), and an inefficient
distribution system, total demand has not been met.
1.19       Firewood, charcoal, crop and animal residues account for about
86% of Zaire's total energy consumption.  Firewood is the major fuel for
rural populations and urban peripheral households, and charcoal for the
urban centers.   A large proportion of urban households with access to
electricity or kerosene prefer woodfuels for cooking at present relative
prices, for both cost and traditional reasons. The pressure of increasing
wood-fuel demand from urban populations is shown by the distance of sources
of supply to Kinshasa (up to 150 km), Kolwezi and Lubumbashi (a radius of
depletion of up to 100 km), and to high density populations in Kivu. About
35 km from Kinshasa, charcoal prices (in 45 kg sacks) are Z3 to Z4 per kg
(about USS60-80 per ton) while in the Kinshasa market they range from Z14
to Z15 per kg (about US$280-300 per ton).  The issues in this vital area
are discussed in paras. 1.22-1.24.
Energy Supply and Related Issues 3/
1.20      Petroleum Supply. In 1983 Zaire imported 44,700 toe of crude oil
and 685,000 toe of refined products and exported over 1.2 million toe of
crude.   Internal consumption is accounted for 63% by transport, i3% by
mining, 11% by other industry and about 7% each by households and
agriculture. Since the late 1970s, petroleum product consumption remained
nearly constant at a level of about 700,000 tons per annum with foreign
exchange scarcity as the main constraint to supply.  Nearly all regions
outside Bas Zaire, the entry point for most product, experienced shortages
because of: (i) uniform national pricing which created no incentive to
transport beyond the Kinshasa market; and (ii) the physical constraints of
the distribution network. To reduce costs and improve supply within Zaire,
3/ Power subsector supply and related issues are detailed in Chapter II.



-8-
measures were introduced in June 1985 which eliminated the import monopoly
of the national oil company, PetroZaire, the fixed market quotas of the
five marketing companies and the uniform national prices for products.
Additional savings could be achieved through market-oriented reforms which
are still needed to encourage entry of new suppliers, price competition
among marketing companies and competitive bidding for product imports.
Product movement is also costly and unreliable because of inefficient
lightering by barges, the deteriorated state of the Matadi-Kinshasa
pipeline, lack of adequate storage, and logistical problems along the
distribution route, particularly on the Voie Nationale on Zaire River.
Some pipeline rehabilitation and storage additions are being financed with
private capital of the marketing companies, and improved product unloading
and other storage needs are also being reviewed.
1.21      Exploration activities have been carried out in the areas of the
Coastal and Central Basins and Tanganyika Graben. The Coastal Basin is the
only area under production, with operations offshore and onshore.
Exploration of the Central Basin, dating from the 1950s, has been
inconclusive, but recent revival of aeromagnetic and gravimetric surveys
indicates renewed oil company interest; this will be pursued further
through  IDA-financed  data  reinterpretations.       Similar  IDA-supported
activities have had positive results for the Zaire segment of the Northern
Tanganyika Graben for which companies have submitted acreage offers.
1.22      Household Energy.   Household consumption accounts for about 80%
of the final demand for energy comprised almost exclusively of wood
products originating from natural forests. Urban areas are associated with
a highly concentrated demand, primarily for charcoal, which results in a
drawdown of wood resources at rates exceeding natural regeneration in the
readily accessible hinterland.   Rural areas have been less affected thus
far because of the dispersed population, relative abundance of woody
biomass, and the traditional practice of gathering wood without felling
trees, but threats to future rural supply are nonetheless present from
destructive agricultural clearing and over-exploitation of forests by
industries. Although in a global context, Zaire's deforestation is not at
the critical level of other African countries, the trend for natural
forests near  to urban areas  is one of accelerated degradation.   The
Government   is  presently  without  adequate  strategy,   policies   and
institutions  for  coping  with  the  issues  of  forestry  production  and
exploitation.    The Government's main attempts to date to address  the
energy-related problems caused by deforestation have been in the Kinshasa
region for which it has plans to accelerate electrificatior: (para. 2.23)
and thus reduce the pressure on traditional fuelwood resources.  This is
optimistically expected to have a major impact on the demand for charcoal
only in the medium term (ten years). A complementary (or alternative) plan
to supply Kinshasa with wood energy through development of fuelwood
plantations on the Bateke Plateau, 150 km from Kinshasa is under
consideration, and the Government has requested Bank Group assistance for
this operation which will include institutional and policy assistance.
1.23       Carefully controlled exploitation of existing forest reserves in
the Cuvette Centrale and new development of plantations on the Bateke
Plateau would address Kinshasa's short and longer term wood energy needs.
Small, monitored projects in the Cuvette Centrale should be carefully



- 9 -
evaluated with a view to supply Kinshasa's charcoal needs in the medium to
long-term.     Such projects could exploit present logging residues  in
existing concessions and harvest some of the non-commercial timber as
well.   The Government,  through the supervisory role for the National
Reforestation Service (NRS), should evaluate the participation of small
entrepreneurs and private industry if such projects are feasible by
granting permits for cutting and re-planting operations, and for on-site
charcoal production. Comparative economic costs would be further defined
and pilot projects proposed along with a household energy planning program
under the proposed project (para. 4.05).
1.24       Supply increases and resource conservation over the next five
years could come from more efficient charcoal production and the wider and
more efficient use of logging and wood processing residues as fuels.
Demand side options to moderate cooking fuel consumption could include
expanded use of electricity and adoption of improved woodfuel, electric and
kerosene stoves.  Lack of reliable data, both on forest and other biomass
fuel resources, and on the level and pattern of household energy demand,
constrain  policy  development,   planning  and  programming.  Technical
assistance is urgently needed for woodfuel resource assessment and project
analysis, household energy demand surveys, strategy planning, investment
programming and policy formulation.   Assistance for a household energy
study will be initiated under the proposed project and followed up under
future energy sector operations which will emphasize planning, programming
and policy formulation.
II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
General
2.01      The power subsector is the responsibility of the DEpartement des
mines  et  de  l'energie  (DME)  (para.  1.04).    The  SociStg  Nationale
d'Electricitd (SNEL), wholly Government owned, is responsible for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Zaire.
A complete description of the organization may be found in Chapter III.
Furthermore, Zaire is a member of Energie des pays des grands lacs (EGL)
which coordinates energy matters on a regional basis with the Governments
of Burundi and Rwanda and is a shareholder with these Governments in the
Societd internationale d'Alectricitd des pays des grands lacs (SINELAC)
which is implementing the Ruzizi II Regional Hydroelectric Project (Annex
2.1).
Access of Service
2.02        Electric power supply is concentrated primarily in two areas:
Kinshasa and the surrounding area of Bas Zaire in the west and the Shaba
region in the south-eastern part of the country.   About 95% of the all
electrical energy is sold in the aforementioned regions. The Shaba region
alone accounts for about 73% of SNEL's total sales, with 57% attributable
to one consumer, GECAMINES, which mines copper and cobalt and whose exports
account for 64% of Zaire's total foreign exchange earnings. In the regions
of Kasai Oriental, Kasai Occidental, Equateur, Haut Zaire and Bandundu,



- 10 -
electricity is available only in small isolated areas from local hydro and
diesel installations. The Kivu region in the eastern part of the country,
is part of an interconnected regional network which serves Kivu (Zaire),
Rwanda and Burundi.
2.03      In 1985 only about 3% of the estimated 30.7 million inhabitants
in Zaire had access to electricit; 4/ this percentage varies from one
region to another, but is very low even in major cities.   The highest,__
percentage is 13% in Kinsbasa, and except for Shaba, Kinshasa and Bas
Zaire, less than 1% of the remaining 19 million inhabitants have access to
electricity. The situation is even worse in the Kivu region, because the
isolated Kivu transmission and distribution network is very limited.
Zaire's average estimated per capita consumption of electrical energy was
144 kWh in 1985, however, consumption in the Kivu region was only 8 kWh per
capita owing to limited distribution and industrial activity in the region.
Existing Generation Facilities
2.04      The total installed capacity in Zaire is 2,599 MW of which 2,482
KW (95Z) is hydro and the remaining 117 MW (5%) is thermal, mainly diesel.
In 1985 supply from the thermal plants was only 0.4% of the total output
(Table 2.1).   Twenty-seven hydro power plants with a total installed
capacity of 80 MW and many thermal power plants of a total installed
capacity of about 59 MW are owned and operated by private companies for
their own electricity needs.   SNEL has a total installed generating
capacity of 2,460 MW of which 2,402 MW (98Z) is hydro and the remainder
diesel (58 MW). A detailed list of all the generating facilities in the
country, may be found in Annex 2.2, and those owned by SNEL are shown on
IBRD Map No. 18989.  Annual generating capability of the SNEL plants is
about 11,300 GWh.  However, in 1985, the total demand was only 1,050 MW and
total generation was 4,800 GWh (Annex 2.3), pointing to a large excess
installed generation capacity (para. 2.06).

Eastern and Southern African countries, and comparable average estimated
per capita consumption of electrical energy for other countries, are

2.05       The largest hydroelectric plants are concentrated in the Bas
Zaire/Kinshasa and Shaba regions. The Bas Zaire/Kinshasa region has the
largest installed capacity including Zongo (75 MW), Inga 1 (350 MW), and
Inga II (1,424 MW) which were commissioned in 1965, 1974 and 1982
respectively.   The four hydropower plants of the Shaba region (Nseke: 248
MW; Nzilo: 108 MW; Mwandigusha: 68 MW; and Koni: 42 MU) are being
rehabilitated under the IDA Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project (CR
1224-ZR; para. 1.10). The Ruzizi I hydroplant in Kivu (28.2 MW) would be
rehabilitated within the proposed project (para. 4.05). SNEL also owns and
operates 5 hydro (totaling 58 MW) and 32 diesel (totaling 58 MW) power
stations which supply the rest of the cities, including some very large
ones, such as Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi, Mbandaka and Kisangani. Most of the
isolated plants date from the 1960's and perform poorly due to lack of
maintenance and spares. Nearly all SNEL's power plants, including Inga I,
Inga II and Ruzizi I, but pn-ticularly the isolated thermal and hydro
plants are in need of rehabilitation owing to limited technical capability
and irregular maintenance during periods of foreign exchange scarcity.
SNEL's present practice has been to meet maintenance needs on an ad hoc
basis without any plan or priorities.         A systematic review of the
rehabilitation needs is being ca-ried out within the power development plan
(para. 3.13).
2.06      In 1974, the Government decided to construct the 1,424 MW Inga II
hydroelectric station, together with the Inga-Shaba transmission system
(SIS) comprising a 1,700 km, 1,000 kV direct current (D.C.) line running
from the Inga II power station in western Zaire to Kolvezi (Shaba) in the
south-eastern part of the country, with converter stations at Inga and
Kolwezi.   Related investments also included reinforcements of the Shaba
region high voltage system with a new 220 kV transmission line and
installation of up-to-date teleconmrmications and control system. Eight
units of 178 NW each and the SIS were commissioned in 1982-1983. The total
cost of this program was about US$2 billion in 1983 prices,5/ primarily
financed by a consortium of banks led by the U.S. EXIM Bank and the
Governments of Italy and Sweden.   However, the load forecast used to
justify the project was based on overly optimistic expectations of the
expansion of the copper mines and smelters, rapid expansion of the economy
and new industrial development in an export free zone (ZOFI; para. 2.22).
Today Inga II generates only about 190-200 MW (about 142 of its capacity)
to supply the D.C. transmission line to Shaba.   The surplus installed

-12-
capacity at the Inga II hydropower station is thus about 1,225 MW with an
annual generation capability of about 7,500 GWh. Its underutilization is a
cause of concern, not only because it involves inefficient use of expensive
capital, but also because destructive cavitation phenomena take place in
turbines operating at low load.   The Government wishes to increase the
utilization of the existing capacity by increasing the demand for power.
Among the alternatives under consideration are:  (i) the establishment of
industries under the provisions of the Zone Franche d'Inga (ZOFI;
para. 2.22); (ii) accelerated expansion of the distribution network in
Kinshasa (para. 2.23); (iii) substitution of gas oil and fuel oil-fired
boilers and furnaces by electrical boilers and furnaces in industry,
particularly in the Kinshasa area (para. 2.25); (iv) power exports to Congo
(para. 2.26); and, (v) increased utilization of the SIS (tapping at Kananga
and exports to Zimbabwe, paras. 2.27 and 2.28).   A variety of proposed
prices are associated with these alternatives and the viability of the
schemes depend to a large extent upon the cost of Inga's surplus power
(para.  2.22).    Further  details  on  the  schemes  are  given  in  the
referenced paragraphs.
Transmission
2.07      The total length of SNEL's transmission lines at the end of 1984
was  4,971  km.   As  SNEL  was  formed  from  several  private  companies
(para. 3.02), voltage levels vary among the various lines (Annex 2.4).
This causes only minor problems because of non-uniformity of spare parts
for the transformers. The transmission system has received sporadic
maintenance but requires only minor rehabilitation.
2.08       More than 34% of the transmission network is comprised of the
Inga-Shaba direct current transmission line (SIS) which connects Bas Zaire/
Kinshasa to Shaba (para. 2.06). The line is capable of carrying the full
design load of 1,120 MW. Present converter station capacity is limited to
560 MW; but, when required, additional units could be installed in two
stages:  840/1120 MW.   Presently the line transmits about 200 MW and
150 GWh/month, or about 24% of its design capacity as two generating units
in the Shaba power plants have been shut down for rehabilitation
(para. 1.10).  The reliability and thus the availability of the SIS has
steadily increased over the months since it was put into service in 1982.
Maintenance and operation of the SIS is carried out by a private company at
a cost of about US$1.2 million per month.   At its current level of
transmission, the cost of transporting energy from Inga to Shaba via the
SIS is about USt0.8/kWh, excluding the capital cost of the line itself. As
GECAMINES is the major consumer served by the SIS, an increase in copper
production would result in greater utilization of the transmission line;
however, this is unlikely to happen over the next five years or as long as
the international copper market remains depressed. Rehabilitation of the
existing hydrostations in the Shaba region, requiring a shutdown of at
least 140-230 MW over a three to four year period, necessitates making up
the shortfall of power supplies through the SIS through 1985-1989. At the
end of this period, the Shaba region would require only nominal amounts of
power from the SIS, making continued use financially unattractive. It is



-13-
proposed that alternative uses for the line e.g. tapping in Kananga (para.
2.27) and exports to neighbouring countries (para. 2.28), be reviewed to
determine the long-term options of the SIS. With financing from the funds
of CR 1224-ZR, SNEL has set up a panel of experts to study the optimal
operations of the main interconnected system (Inga-Bas Zaire-Kinshasa a.c.
system/Inga-Shaba d.c. line/Shaba a.c. system), including immediate actions
to correct maintenance and operating problems which have caused supply
threatening deterioration in the Inga I and Inga II facilities.   The
recommendations of the first phase of the study (Annex 7.1); by the panel
were discussed during negotiations and funds for urgent conservation/
rehabilitation works, necessary materials and spares, and follow up studies
have been included in the proposed project (para. 4.03).
Distribution
2.09      Although forty-eight towns had distribution networks by end-1985,
the bulk of the distribution consumers is concentrated in Kinshasa and
Lubumbashi  (Annex 2.5).   Practically all transmission and distribution
systems and particularly those associated with isolated thermal and
hydroplants need rehabilitation owing to lack of maintenance and technical
expertise, resulting in high losses and unreliable supply. Although some
work is being undertaken (para. 2.13), this has been carried out without
extensive planning and prioritization, and further rehabilitation is
required.   A systematic review of rehabilitation needs of the transmission
and distribution systems would be carried out within the preparation of the
long-term power development plan (para. 3.13). The distribution networks
in the Kivu region require extensive rehabilitation and need to be extended
to meet the present unserved demand and expected growth in demand
(para. 2.16).
Connections and Sales
2.10       At the end of 1985 the total number of consumers was 116,509.
Out of this total, connections to consumers supplied from high, medium, and
low voltages were 9, 1,194 and 115,306, respectively. The sales to various
categories of consumers are summarized in Table 2.2.  Sales to GECAMINES
were 2,520 GWh, representing 57% of SNEL's total sales in Zaire.  Eighty
percent of the medium voltage consumers are located in the Bas
Zaire-Kinshasa and Shaba regions consuming 93% of the power at this voltage
level.   The average annual consumptions per consumer for the MV and LV
consumers are 0.8 GWh and 7,345 kWh respectively. In view of the very low
level of access to electricity the high average consumption of LV consumers
shows that they consist mainly of commercial enterprises and households
with relatively high incomes.  The total ntumber of consumers in the Kivu
region was 8,840 in 1985.  Out of this, SO consumers were supplied from
medium voltage.   Sales in Kivu amounted to 40.4 GWh.  Annual average
consumption for low voltage consumers in the Kivu region was about
2,450 kWh, showing again that mainly commercial enterprises and households
with relatively high incomes have access to electricity.   Summary data are
given in Annex 2.6.

Exports and Imports of Electrical Energy
2.11      SNEL has exported small amounts of power to neighboring countries
(Congo, Angola, Burundi and Rwanda) for several years, but this has only
amounted to 2-3Z of the total sales and fluctuated over the years (Annex
2.6). In addition, since 1976, there have been exchanges with Zambia based
on equalized exports and imports.   Prospects  for future exports are
summarized in para. 2.15.
Losses
2.12      Losses have varied between 5Z and 12Z for SNEL and 8% and 38% for
the Kivu region.  The variations reflect the presence of unbilled and
unmetered connections, and the fragility of the readings and data base.
The rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution networks will
alleviate the technical losses.   For the administrative losses caused by
underbilliug,  it  was  agreed  during  negotiations  that  the  consumer
inventory,'collection improvement program presently being carried out in
Kinshasa an! Lubumbashi (para. 3.16) will be expanded to the Kivu region
with a target completion date of December 31, 1986.
Works in Progre!ts
2.13           EVEL's  construction  in  progress  consists  primarily  of
rehabilitation of its aging hydroTower and transport systems (Inga I, Shaba
network, self-financed repair End replacement to small stations) and
transmission/distribution extensi.n (reinforcement of Kinshasa network, Bas
Zaire electrification, Bukavu-Katana line). In addition, SNEL is in the
early stages of a large and ambitious distribution extension project for
the accelerated electrification of Kinshasa (para. 2.23) and construction
of medium voltage lines and substations to supply electrical boilers and
furnaces; the objective of th4 latter project is to substitute hydro based
electricity for gas oil or fuel oil (para. 2.25).  Works for about 40,000



-15-
connections and the construction of medium voltage lines to supply the
electrical boilers to be installed in many industries are being financed by
loans obtained from the African Development Bank and the Italian
Government.   Although SNEL has recently started  the preparation of a
long-term power development plan to the year 2000 with assistance financed
under CR 1224-ZR (para. 3.13), all the works presently in progress have
been initiated without such a plan. Provision will be made under the
proposed project to continue work on the long term plan and for its review
by IDA.
Historical Demand for Electrical Power
2.14      The total demand for electrical energy in Zaire followed general
economic trends and, in particular, those of the copper industry. Demand
stagnated between 1974 to 1977, and decreased substantially in 1978
(-5.6%), which were the peak years of Zaire's economic crisis; then
increased between 1979 to 1981 as economic recovery gradually set in,and
reached 3,931 GWh in 1981. Details are given in Annex 2.6.

In 1982, total demand decreased once again as the economy stagnated.
However, it recovered in 1983, and in 1984 the increase over the previous
year was 11.3%.   Total sales in Zaire, reached 4,426 GWh in 1985, an
all-time maximum (Table 2.3).   These last increases correspond to the
economic growth under the stabilization program, launched by the Government
in 1983, to GECAMINES' increased productions with respect to that in 1983,



-16-
and also to the progress made under the consumer inventory, billing and
collection improvement program (para. 3.16). The average annual increases
were 4.5% and 4.1% for the 1974-1985 and 1979-1985 periods, respectively.
The total demand in the Goma-Bukavu-Uvira-Kiliba area increased by about
13X per year between 1979 and 1985 from 19.7 GWh to 40.4 GWh owing mainly
to the entry into operation in December 1981 of an clectrical boiler at the
Bralima brewery in Bukavu. Excluding the boiler, the demand in the area
increased at an average rate of 10% per year in the 1979-1984 period,
reflecting Kivu's relatively high potential for growth.
Load Forecast
2.15      SNEL.  Load forecasts available to SNEL at the time of appraisal
were neither homogeneous nor reliable having been carried out for the
various systems and regions, by various consultants, in different periods,
covering varying time periods. Therefore, the preparation of new forecasts
is a priority of the long-term development plan for the power subsector
which   is   being   prepared,   with   assistance   from   consultants
(Tractionel-Belgium),  funded  under  Credit  1224-ZR  (paras.  1.10  and
3.13). The appraisal mission reviewed the available forecasts and SNEL's
revised investment program.  The most important assumption for the three
scenarios ('high', 'medium', and 'low') considered was the commissioning of
ZOFI industries in 1990, 1993 or later, which substantially affected the
supply-demand picture. However, a move toward a more general industrial
promotion role for ZOFI (para. 2.22) will lower considerably forecast
industrial consumption. In this case, the 'low' scenario which is based on
extrapolation of the recent growth in demand into the next decade, seems to
be the most likely.   Details for the 'low' growth scenario are given in
Annex 2.7 and summarized in Table 2.4 on the following page.  Exports to
Congo are projected to be around 90 GWh/year until 1991 (para. 2.26), then
will decrease to about 25 GWh/year as Congo's own installed capacity
increases. Exports to Burundi and Rwanda are projected to decrease in the
1988-1991 period (para. 2.17) when Rwegura and Ruzizi II hydroplants will
be commissioned;  later  these  exports will increase again.   Marginal
increases are expected in the sales to the high voltage consumers (0.5% per
annum over the 1985/2000 year period), with limited demand growth from
GECAMINES. Medium voltage sales are forecast to increase by about 4.4% per
annum during the same period while low voltage sales are projected to
increase on average by about 7.3% per annum.  Overall, the average annual
increase of the total sales in Zaire is estimated at 2.7% p.a. in 1986-1988
period reaching 3.0% p.a. in 1991. The shares of sales from the HV, MV and
LV are expected to change to 41%, 21% and 33% in the year 2000,
respectively.  By that time exports will make up about 2Z of the total
sales.   Fending further analysis as part of the Power Development Plan
(para. 3.13), IDA considers this to be the most likely scenario.

carry out a detailed study of the least cost development of the power
system in the Kivu region, in the light of construction of the Ruzizi II
Regional Hydropower Project, including a detailed review of the load
forecast for the Kivu area in Zaire. The consultants forecast that demand
in the area, including presently unserved demand, would increase from 46
GWh in 1985 to 93 GWh in 1995 at 6.7% per year in the 1985-1990 period and
thereafter at 7.5% per year to 1995.  The appraisal mission reviewed this
forecast and in the light of latest information about the possibility of a
pharmaceutical company installing an electric boiler (6 MW) at its plant in
Bukavu and recommissioning of the cement plant in Katana, introduced
brought some slight modifications with  respect  to  gradual  increments
created by these two projects. It is forecast that demand will increase by
8% per year in the 1986-1990 per4od and by 9% per year between 1991 and
1995, resulting in an average annual growth of 8% for the 1986-1995
period. It is also expected that the consumer inventory/billing/collection
improvement program being implemented in 1986 in the Kivu region
(para. 2.12) will alleviate the administrative losses and create a
relatively high increase in 1986. Details are given in Annex 2.9 and the
forecast is summarized in Table 2.5.

SNELI's sales in the Kivu region to its local consumers are projected to
increase from 52 GWh to 104 GWh during the 1986-1995 period, an overall
average annual increase of 8.0%.  Considering that in the recent past the
demand for electricity in this region grew at about 10% per year excluding
special industrial loads (para. 2.14), and that there is substantial
unserved demand, particularly in Goma, the forecast is reasonable. SNEL
will also continue to export electrical energy to Rwanda and Burundi as
discussed in para. 2.17.
Zaire (Kivu)-Burundi-Rwanda Regional Inzerconnected System
2.17        In examining the electric energy needs of the Kivu region of
Zaire, it is necessary to take the demand for Rwanda and Burundi into
consideration as well.  The interconnection of the electrical networks of
the three ccuntries is being strengthened with the construction of
Ruzizi II Project. A forecast of the availability of supply and demand for
electrical energy in the regional interconnected system 's given in



-19-
Annex  2.10.    The  demand  forecast  for  the  interconnected  system  is
equivalent to an average annual increase in demand of 9.42 during the
1986-1995 period. Review of these supply and demand forecasts leads to the
following conclusions:
A. From the regional (Burundi-Rwanda-Zaire (Kivu)) point of view:
(a) Energy from the Ruzizi II project will be required to supply the
regional needs beginning in 1989 (expected commissioning date
end 1988);
(b) the third unit (13.8 MW) of the Ruzizi II should be commissioned
by end-199?; and
(c) a new regional project would need to be commissioned ioy mid-1995.
B. From the point of view of the Kivu region of Zaire:
(a) following commissioning of the Rwegura (Burundi) and Ruzizi II
(Regional) power stations, the regional interconnected system
-particularly Burundi-is expected to have an oversupply of
electric power from the interconnected system until end-1993; 7/
this will limit exports from Zaire in 1989 and 1990;
(b) however, by 1995, Zaire (Kivu) exports are expected to increase
to a level to use all the surplus capacity; and
(c) Burundi will start using its share of Rrzizi II in 1988 and will
need to use more than its share startl-g in 1994; i.e. it will
become a net importer from Zaire.
2.18        The ability of the three national utilities (SNEL in Zaire,
ELECTROGAZ in Rwanda, and REGIDESO in Burundi) to absorb this surplus by
extending the interconnected grid to other regional towns is limited by the
availability of capital, both in foreign and local currency, and the
economic and financial viability of serving the demand, in all three
countries. The IDA Rwanda Power Prc4ect (CR 1495-RW, approved on June 12,
1984), the IDA Burundi Power Transmission and Distribution Project (CR
1593-BU, approved on May 9, 1985) and the proposed project would each
provide funds to construct new transmission lines and to rehabilitate and
extend the distribution networks, thereby expanding the interconnected grid
power consumption. However, further investment will likely be required as
well as the promotion of electric energy e.g. for cooking.   This will be
addressed in the preparation of IDA-assisted least-cost development plans
for each of the countries.
7/ Without Rwegura, it would not have been possible in Burundi to teet
daily peak demands and the energy requirements from 1987 onwards until
the Ruzizi II Project is commissioned.



-20-
Need for the Project
2.19        Rehabilitation and Extension of the Kivu Network. During the
preparation of the Ruzizi II Project it was found that Ruzizi I was in need
of rehabilitation. Inspections in 1984 and 1985, by consultants confirmed
this and identified works to be carried out.  The consultants determined
that the rehabilitation of the power station was the least-cost method for
the Zaire (Kivu)/Burundi/Rwanda interconnected system of generating the
energy which is now being produced in Ruzizi I.   In spite of excess
capacity in the period 1988-1992, rehabilitation of the power station is
necessary as degradation of the plant will result in its being unusable.
Existing transmission and distribution networks have not been maintained
properly because of lack of funds, both local and toreign, and also because
of the difficult political situation which prevailed in the region
following the independence of Zaire. In addition, consultants also studied
the possibility of extending the system to provide service to potential new
consumers in the areas surrounding the towns of the region and found that
these extensions would be justified (Annex 4.1).
2.20        Supplemental Rehabilitation of the Shaba Network.   The Shaba
Power System Rehabilitation Project was designed based on a 1980 study of
the physical conditions cf the generating plants and network in the Shaba
Region. It was recognized that the study could not predict the totality of
works needed once the units of the four power stations were opened and
provision was made under the project for a fund for unforeseen repairs of
about US$1.29 million. Works are now well advanced and have revealed the
need for supplementary rehabilitation works and replacements in excess of
the original estimate. These works are included in the proposed project in
view of the need to complete rehabilitation as soon as possible to ensure a
reliable supply of power to the mining industry (para 4.05).
2.21          Urgent Repairs and Operational  Improvements  for the Inga
Complex.   The operation of Inga I, Inga II and the Inga-Shaba line as
separate facilities rather than a synchronized system, plus the over design
of Inga II and the Inga-Shaba line have posed technical problems since
their commissioning.   Remedial actions by the original constructors and
efforts by operating personnel have sustained day-to-day operations, but
not without loss of efficiency and reliability, and some deterioration to
the plants.   In mid-1985 IDA recommended an independent study:  (i) to
correct the operating problems and establish rehabilitation and maintenance
procedures which would improve system reliability; and (ii) to develop a
long-term strategy which would eliminate the technical problems of
operation with excess  capacity.    Funds were  reallocated  under  Credit
1224-ZR  to finance  on  an emergency basis  a panel of  experts  for a
multi-phase independent study.   The first phase (urgent and short-term
measures to ensure operating soundness and identification of long-term
studies) was completed during March 1986, and preliminary findings conveyed
in May 1986.  Recommendations included a series of emergency actions and
urgent works which are included in the proposed project (para. 4.05). A
comprehensive  program  responding  to  medium-term  rehabilitation  and
recommendations of additional studies proposed by the panel is being
considered for the proposed energy project under preparation.



-21-
Alternatives Considered by the Government and SNEL to Utilize the Surplus
Generation Capacity at Inga II
2.22       Zone Franche d'Inga (ZOFI).  The Government has unsuccessfully
tried  to  promote  energy-intensive  industrial  development  (aluminium,
ammonia) by offering promotional electricity rates (Annex 7.1). However,
as the Inga surplus approaches full utilization, the promotional rates
offered for ZOFI by the Government would be well below the LRMC and amount
to a subsidy to the consumers. ZOFI's role has been revised to a promoter
of general industrial development with low cost energy as one incentive.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that prices for surplus power
sold from Inga II would be adjusted to reflect long-run marginal cost at
the time Inga's capacity is fully committed and investments in additional
facilities for the supply and delivery of electricity are required.
2.23      Accelerated Electrification of Kinshasa.  One of the stated goals
of the Government is to make electricity available to about 70% of
Kinshasa's population by 1991. The Government expects, with this program,
to alleviate pressure on deforestation due to the concentrated demand by
Kinshasa's 200,000 households market for fuelwood (mainly charcoal) by
substituting surplus hydroelectricity for charcoal for cooking purposes.
As a first stage, the Government proposed to increase the number of
low-voltage connections in Kinshasa from 60,000 to 150,000 during the
1985-1988 period, mostly among low and middle-income families. The initial
phase, comprising 40,000 connections, is in progress (para. 2.13) but has
experienced difficulties due to the high cost of internal wiring (not
included in the program) and the inability of the Government to support the
cost of  subsidized  connections.    Preliminary analysis  indicates  that
substantial cost reductions could be made by decreasing design standards.
The Government has requested Bank Group assistance in reviewing the
technical, economic and financial aspects of the program and this review
will be linked to household energy studies under the project.
2.24       The scale and timing of the Kinshasa electrification program as
proposed by the Government (three years) also appear unrealistic given
Zaire's economic situation and the technical and financial capacity of SNEL
and/or the Government to implement such a program.  During negotiations,
agreement was obtained that during preparation of SNEL's long-term
development plan (para. 3.13), the timing and financial implications of the
accelerated electrification program of Kinshasa on SNEL and the Government
would be examined to determine the optimal phasing of the program and to
limit investment in accordance with that phasing; IDA, the Government and
SNEL would exchange views and agree on the best way to proceed with the
program.   In order to assist SNEL and the Government in determining the
feasibility of assumptions on household electricity use, the proposed
project includes a study of urban household energy needs, supplies and
substitutabilities (para. 4.05).
2.25      Conversion of Gas Oil and Fuel-Oil Fired Industrial Boilers and
Furnaces  to Electricity.   SNEL is also encouraging the conversion of
industrial boilers and furnaces in Kinshasa and other cities served by



-22-
Inga II to reduce the consumption of gas oil and fuel oil and increase that
of electric power. The additional demand for power would be about 100 MW
nationwide (500 GWh/year), most of it concentrated in the Kinshasa area.
SNEL is considering a price which would not exceed either the medium
voltage rate or the equivalent gas oil or fuel oil costs during the period
of boiler investment amortization (six to seven years) and rejoin the MV
tariff in effect after that period. A tariff based on this principle would
exceed the short-run cost of delivered power and also meet long-run pricing
objectives as long as MV power is priced to reflect its economic cost.
2.26       Exports to Congo.  According to current forecasts, Congo will
continue to import about 90 GWh/year from Zaire until 1991, to meet the
demand of Brazzavile until 1987 and the demand of both Brazzaville and
Pointe Noire, thereafter, during the dry season. According to the Congo's
own investment program installed capacity is expected to increase after
1991, limiting the potential for export (decreasing to about 25 GWh/year,
by 1995).  However, the Power Sector Memorandum dated September 1984 for
the People's Republic of the Congo (PRC), recommended that the PRC should
postpone costly investment in new generation projects and take advantage of
the large quantity of energy available from Zaire at an attractive price
(FCFA 5-7/kWh; USt1.3-1.8/kWh depending on the quantity) while maintaining
back-up capacity to preserve a degree of independence, as the power supply
from Zaire appears to be the least-cost solution for Brazzaville.  In 1985,
the two countries initiated discussions on the construction of a 220 kV,
300 km high voltage transmission line from Inga to Pointe Noire, which is
the port and main industrialized area of PRC.  As both countries would
gain, the Bank Group would encourage through its sector dialogue the
expansion of Zaire's exports on the basis of a price for power beneficial
to both parties.
Options Considered by the Government and SNEL to Increase the
Utilization of the Inga-Shaba Transmission System
2.27      Tapping the SIS at Kananga.  The city of Kananga, with a popula-
tion of about 450,000, near which the line passes, and Mbuji-Mayi, 150 km
away from the  line, are most obvious candidates for tapping.   Their
combined potential demand may well be around 20 MW but it is not possible
to estimate it accurately on the basis of present consumption, given the
current suppressed demand resulting from inadequate supply.   This option
would also increase the utilization of the Inga II power station. A major
difficulty, however, is that the tapping technology has not had enough
practical application anywhere in the world.   On the other hand,  for
Kananga, two nearby hydropower sites, namely Katende I (6.6 MW) and Katende
II (24 MW) have been identified, and the increase in demand in Mbuji-Mayi
could be supplied by three additional units of 1.1 MW each to be installed
by SNEL at the Lubilanji II hydropower plant presently being built by a
local mining company. It is therefore recommended that SNEL should execute
a three-pronged strategy to serve the needs of the region: in the short
term, rehabilitate and/or increase the efficiency of the diesel stations
now in operation at Kananga and Mbuji-Mayi; in the medium term, construct
the least-cost of the identified hydro projects; and in the longer term,



-23-
reassess the merits of tapping, based on technological and economic
analyses.    The Katende I Project and the units at Lubilanji II are
presently included in SNEL's draft development plan.  During negotiations
agreement was obtained that the study for the long-term options for the SIS
(Annex 4.1) would also deteruine whether follow up work for a tapping
station would be useful.
2.28       Exports to Zimbabwe.  In theory, exports of power to Zimbabwe,
chrough Zambia, could also increase the utilization of the SIS as all three
countries are already interconnected. However, with the present state of
the very weak growth of demand for electricity in Zambia and Zimbabwe,
existing and projected power surpluses in both countries and the other
supply alternatives available (e.g. rehabilitation of plants in Zimbabwe),
this option appears to be remote, at least in the medium-term. It may be
of longer-term interest, however, and should be considered in the context
of  regional  long-term planning  (Zaire/Zambia/Zimbabwe).    The Bank is
currently working with Zimbabwe on the preparation of its least-cost
development program.
III. TEE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
3.01       The Borrower would be the Republic of Zaire which would onlend
US$36.9  million  equivalent  to  the  Societe  Nationale  d'Electricite
(SNEL), the project implementing agency. US$0.1 million equivalent would
finance a study of urban household energy needs and alternative supply
options; the study would be supervised by SNEL on behalf of the Ministry of
Mines and Energy.
SNEL
3.02      SNEL is a Government-owned public enterprise which was originally
established in 1970 with responsibility for the construction of the Inga I
hydroelectric generating station.   In 1974, the Government dissolved the
six existing private power companies and transferred their assets,
liabilities and responsibilities to SNEL.  SNEL was effectively recreated
in its present form by Ordinance 78-196 dated May 5, 1978, which gives SNEL
the authority necessary to discharge its responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Zaire. In December
1978, SNEL took over the electric generating and distribution facilities
and operations of REGIDESO, the Government-owned water utility which in
addition to its water supply operations also sold electricity to consumers
in urban areas, where it generated electricity for its water supply and
pumping operations.
3.03       SNEL operates under the supervision of three Ministries (Mines
and Energy, Finance and Portfolio) through a ten member Board of Directors
appointed by the President of the Republic. The chairman of the Board is
the Director General (President Delegue General-PDG), a full-time chief



-24-
executive responsible for overall management of the company. The Board is
comprised of SNEL's Deputy Director General (Delgue Genfral Adjoint-DGA)
and technical and financial/administrative directors, representatives of
the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Ministry of Finance, Bank of Zaire, and
REGIDESO and two independent members. The Board meets at least every two
months. Since 1981, when IDA lending to SNEL was initiated, the Board has
taken prompt and effective decisions regarding proposals for tariff
adjustments and restructuring of the organization, both of which were key
elements of  the IDA/SNEL dialogue.   While in principle  the Board is
responsible for all decisions relating to SNEL's operational and financial
performance, tariff adjustments are subject to Government approval and in
the 1970s major investment decisions were taken by the Government without
due regard for their future impact on SNEL (para. 3.14).   A management
committee comprising the PDG, DGA, two directors, and a workers'
representative are responsible for the day-to-day management of SNEL.
3.04       Provision has been made for internal accounting controls, but
these have not been effective except for the policing of cash transactions
in regional offices. The management assistance program (para. 3.16) is in
the process  of establishing an internal audit unit.   A three member
external audit commission (CollAge des Commissaires aux Comptes), which
reports to the Minister of Finance, has the right to examine all of SNEL's
financial  activities  and  operations  and  give  an  opinion  on  the
representativeness  of  SNEL's  accounts.    While  this  follows  standard
practice for parastatals in Zaire, it has not been effective or produced
useful results in general owing to the scarcity of adequately trained
accountants  and  auditors.    SNEL  has  therefore  appointed  independent
external auditors for the auditing of its accounts in accordance with IDA
stipulations (para. 3.11).
Organization and Management
3.05       SNEL's organization chart is shown in Annex 3.1.  The present
PDG, a Zairian national, was appointed to his position in 1980 and has
proved to be competent and effective in working towards improvement in
SNEL's performance.   During the last part of 1982, SNEL restructured its
organization to replace the previous horizontal pattern-in which fourteen
department directors reported to the management committee-with a pyramidal
hierarchy. In April 1985, the general management was strengthened by the
creation of the position of the Deputy director general (DGA), however, the
position is presently vacant.   Three positions are immediately under the
PDG and DGA: two managing directors, one in charge of finance, personnel
and aaministration (an expatriate) 4ncluding sales management, the other (a
Zaire national) in charge of the techiuical orerations and construction of
projects; and, a general manager (a Zaire national) in charge of all
aspects of operations in the seven regions.Compared with the previous
structure  which  was  inefficient  due   to  excessive   diffusion  of
responsibilities, the new structure has improved communication channels 3nd
clarified responsibility.   Further changes in the structure are being
considered to reduce the over-centralization of authority; SNEL has
established  an  Organization  and  Methods  Committee  (OMC)  to  define



-25-
guidelines to identify, train or recruit competent managers for the
eventual decentralization. OMC is being assisted by management consultants
(Sema-Metra, France and Sobemap, Belgium) under the institutional
assistance activities of CR 1224-ZR (para. 3.16).
3.06       SNEL has its head office in Kinshasa and is organized into six
geographical regions (Kinshasa, Western (Bas Zaire), Northern, Central,
Southern (Shaba) and Eastern (including Kivu)) and one administrative
region- manag_ng the operations of the Inga-Shaba transmission system
(SIS).  The organization of the Eastern Region which includes the Kivu
network is typical of SNEL's regional structures in that it comprises a
regional office in Kisangani which is largely autonomous in its technical
management of the operations of the local hydro and diesel plants and
distribution.   However, decisions on personnel and finance are taken by
headquarters.   The Kivu subregion is in charge of the operation of the
Ruzizi I hydropower plant and exports to Rwanda and Burundi.  Financial
control is exercised by the head office in Kinshasa, including accounting
and centralized bank account. The Kivu local staff and management (Zairian
nationals except for foreman in charge of the Ruzizi I-Bujumbura line) are
competent; operations have been carried out without major problems; power
failures, average for a system of that age, have been mainly due to
shortages of materials and replacement equipment requiring foreign
exchange.
Personnel
3.07         The present profile of SNEL staff reflects a low level of
training and skills at the time of recruitment limiting the basic
theoretical knowledge essential for fully effective execution of tasks.
Performance is further constrained by shortages of tools and equipment in
operating units.   Staff motivation has suffered from these constraints,
inadequate remuneration and the perceived absence of career prospects. In
the context of SNEL's general management improvement program (para. 3.16)
which is being financed under CR 1224-ZR, SNEL is reviewing an incentive
system to improve staff performance.   Upgrading of SNEL staff would be
supported through assistance to the Sanga traning center under the
proposed project (Annex 4.1).   Materials and tools to rehabilitate the
center would also be supplied.
3.08        At the end of 1985, SNEL employed a total of 4,697 staff to
supply 116,509 consumers-an average of one employee per 25 consumers. In
view of the diverse nature of SNEL's operations, which include diesel
installations, hydro generating stations and a number of scattered isolated
systems and the geographical dispersion, the ratio of consumers per
employee does not appear to be excessive in comparison with other Eastern
and Southern African countries.   As shown in Annex 3.2, there are 946
cadres (managers and university graduates) and skilled technicians, and
3,751 unskilled workers. The implementation of SNEL's new organizational
structure (para. 3.05) streamlined employment at SNEL by reducing unskilled
staff.   The number of employees fell from 5,200 in 1980 to 4,697 in
December 1985. It is expected that savings being achieved will be utilized
to remunerate staff for good performance thereby creating better incentives
and the possibility of career advancement.



-26-
3.09      The number of expatriate staff declined steadily during the last
10 years from 67 in 1985 to 30 in 1986. Lower technician levels have also
been filled by Zairians while the remaining expatriates are in key
managerial positions in the areas of management of power plants and
transmission lines, and accounting, co-nercial, administrative and computer
operations. However, higher expatriate technician positions have also been
filled by advisers obtained through bilateral technical assistance programs
in form of grants.   Presently 13 advisers, financed through bilateral
assistance programs, are employed by SNEL.8/ SNEL is reliant to a large
degree on c -nsultants, especially for its financial, commercial, project
studies, design and procurement activities. The training of counterparts
has not received adequate attention because of the emphasis by expatriates
and consultants on carrying out day-to-day responsibilities to keep SNEL
operating.   The objective  of progressively decreasing  the number of
consultants and replacing them with Zairians would receive more attention
under the training activities of the proposed project and the management
assistance program being implemented under CR 1224-ZR and the proposed
project (paras. 3.16 and 4.05).
SNEL Performance
3.10       The Bank Group's first operation with SNEL was the Shaba Power
System Rehabilitation Project which was approved on April 1, 1982
(para.  1.10).    This project  supports  rehabilitation of hydroelectric
generators which are the primary power source for GECAMINES as well as
other consumers of the Shaba Region. Because of the emergency nature of
the operation, the project limited its focus on performance indicators of
SNEL's Southern Region (which includes Shaba) and identified general
SNEL management and operational weaknesses for which further study and
direct technical support from consultants were proposed (para. 3.16).
Implementation of the physical works of the project were delayed by with-
drawal of a cofinancier and delays in the contract award, but are now being
executed  reasonably  well.       Institutional  development  progress  is
encouraging  owing   to  the  receptiveness  of  SNEL's  management  to
recommendations on reorganization and streamlining of procedures, although
staff training has lagged behind because of limited resources and
preoccupation with day-to-day operations. The financial performance of the
Southern Region in isolation from SNEL's overall activities has been
consistently good: tariff adjustments have been adequate to meet covenanted
rates of return (4% in 1983, 6% in 1984 and 8% in 1985) and a separate
accounting region was created for the government-financed Inga-Shaba System
(SIS) (para. 3.06).   The Government's decision in 1983 to end separate
treatment of the SIS and transfer the Inga-Shaba line and Inga II
hydrostation to SNEL is supported by IDA in principle, but will have a
negative impact on SNEL's financial situation in the medium to longer
term.   SNEL's recent financial performance and the implications of the
asset transfer are discussed in Chapter V.
8/ Three French advisors, 8 Belgian advisors, one Egyptian advisor, and
one Yugoslav advisor are provided through bilateral assistance program.



-27-
Accounting and Audits
3.11        SNEL's accounting department is under the supervision of the
Administrative and Financial Director. Accounts are kept centrally for the
head office, seven regions (para. 3.06) plus four sub-regions (three in the
Southern (Shaba) region and one in the Eastern (Kivu) region).   In the
context of the Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project (CR. 1224-ZR),
deficiencies in SNEL's accounts were identified resulting from a shortage
of adequately trained staff, the change to a new accounting system in 1979,
and a lack of financial discipline. In 1980, HElios of France, financed by
the CCCE, began working with SNEL to improve its financial management and
to audit its accounts; in 1983 Helios also initiated a revaluation of
SNEL's assets. Additional assistance is being received under the general
management program financed by CR 1224-ZR (para. 3.16) which aims at
strengthening SNEL's operating capability in several areas including
finance. A limitet' audit of SNEL's accounts was carried out in 1980, and
in compliance w'   conditions established under CR 1224-ZR, annual audits
have been and will continue to be undertaken bf an independent auditor
(CHlios) and submitted to IDA. As CCCE's financing for SNEL's audits ended
in 1984, the proposed project will provide the required foreign exchange
for the 1985-1987 audits. SNEL's 1981-1983 audits were qualified; the 1984
audit received certification with qualification and the 1985 audit is
expected to be completed by September 1986. While improvements have been
noted by Helios in the areas of inter-regional coordination, billing of HV
and MV clients and some accounting practices, problems leading to
qualification of the accounts have been cited in the areas of internal
control, inventory management and the qualifications of accounting staff-
Major revisions to SNEL's accounts included in 1984 correction of anomalies
following recommendations of the auditing, and in 1985 the transfer of
major assets at their value in use and a revaluation of all assets (paras.
3.14 and 5.04).  SNEL is making efforts through the general management
assistance program to improve the standards of its accounting practices.
Insurance
3.12       Insurance in the past, apart from statutory insurance, has only
covered freight and transport of goods as required of contractors employed
by SNEL. SNEL's own risks have been covered on the basis of self insurance
without making any provision for an insurance fund. During negotiations,
agreement was reached to review this policy under the management assistance
program with a view to providing suitable insurance coverage for SNEL's
assets. SNEL does not carry or have not carried out systematic inspections
of its dams. However, the movements of the Nzilo dam in the Shaba region
are being studied by Hydro-Quebec International of Canada, financed from CR
1224-ZR. The Ruzizi I dam was inspected within the feasibility studies of
the proposed project (Annex 4.1).
Investment Planning and Programming
3.13      Systematic planning for the power sector was lacking in the past
in part due to a shortage of qualified staff and expertise and also to a



-28-
lack of strong commitment to the planning concept by the Government.
CR 1224-ZR is financing assistance to SNEL for the preparation of a
long-term development plan to the year 2000.  Exchange of views is being
carried out within the supervision of CR 1224-ZR and preparation of a
proposed energy project. In addition to the new projects, the plan will
include a systematic audit of SNEL's diesel and isolated hydro plant
operations  and  recommendations  on:       (i)  rehabilitating  (including
maintenance needs) the existing small hydro and diesel plants which supply
isolated areas; (ii) extending these plants; and (iii) substituting the
diesel plants with new hydro plants.  During negotiations it was agreed
that the draft of the plan would be completed by September 30, 1986 and
furnished to IDA for an exchange of views. It was also agreed that IDA and
SNEL would exchange views annually on the revisions of this plan until June
30, 1990.  Before undertaking any investment exceeding the equivalent of
US$5 million, the Government and SNEL would furnish for the Association's
approval a justification that the investment is least-cost and has an
assured financing plan which spells out SNEL's and Government's obligations
for financial charges, including debt service, operation, maintenance and
depreciation.   Awaiting  the conclusions of the development plan,  the
Government, SNEL and IDA agreed on an indicative investment program which
reflects reasonable growth in demand for electricity, the availability of
local and foreign funds and conforms to the expected macroeconomic
situation in Zaire. The total costs (base costs, and physical and price
contingencies) of this modified investment *program which covers the
1986-1992 period is estimated at Z 59.7 billion (equivalent to US $693
million) of which Z 49.8 billion (equivalent to US $581 million) is in
foreign currency. SNEL's investment program is given in Annex 3.3.
3.14        In the past, the Government has intervened in the planning
process and carried out under its own financing large infrastructure
investments including the Inga II hydroplant, Inga-Shaba line and Shaba
high voltage line.   These investments were based on overly optimistic
demand projections which have not materialized, resulting in the case of
Inga II and the SIS in substantial capacity underutilization (about 14%
utilization for Inga II and about 24% for the SIS). SNEL has operated the
line and the plant on the Government's behalf since their commissioning in
1982/83; however, ownership, debt service and maintenance charges for
the Inga-Shaba line and debt service for Inga II have remained with the
Government. In 1983, the Government decided that the plant and the line
should become SNEL's assets, although no legal transfer has taken place.
Debt service, operating and maintenance costs of these investments could
not be- borne by consumers without subsidy if all associated costs are also
transferred to SNEL.   This would also represent a long-term burden for
SNEL'.; financial situation since capacity utilization is not expected to
increase above 50% for Inga II by 1991 and may even decline in the case of
SIS as demand in the Shaba region is once again served by local hydropower
stations now under rehabilitation (para. 2.08). As revenues generated from
the assets accrue to SNEL, it is proposed that SNEL finance operating and
maintenance costs of the plant and the line and that portion of the debt
service corresponding to the utilized capacity of Inga II. SNEL and the
Government are in the process of defining legal and financial



-29-
responsibility for the majority of the assets now operated by SNEL and it
is proposed that in the context of this agreement the Government finalize
the transfer of Inga II and the SIS based on their value in use: 302 of
replacement cost for Inga II, and zero for the Inga Shaba line for which
there is limited need given the generating capacity already available in
the Shaba region and a lesser cost alternative to increase supply when
existing capacity is fully utilized. Projected financial statements given
in Annexes 5.1-5.4 introduce these assets as revalued and at their value in
use and assume increases in capacity utilization for Inga II to attain 50Z
by 1991. During negotiations, agreement was reached that SNEL's accounts
would be adjusted to reflect the transfer of Inga II and the SIS at their
value in use in accordance with accounting practices acceptable to IDA.
Legal Transfer of Assets
3.15          The only assets to which SNEL has clear title are those
constituting its original capital, i.e. the assets of the seven former
private companies dissolved in 1974 (para. 3.02). Nearly all investments
undertaken since then have been financed by the Government and are being
operated by  SNEL.    In addition  to a lack of clarity in the legal
arrangements, this situation prevents SNEL from setting its electricity
rates to adequately operate, maintain and renew the majority of assets in
the power sector. SNEL has initiated discussions with the Government on an
agreement which would clarify respective legal and financial objectives and
broaden  the  objectives  of  its  tariff  policy.    During  negotiations,
agreement was reached that SNEL and the Government conclude by June
30, 1987 a legal agreement to (i) determine ownership of all assets
financed by the Government but which are operated by SNEL; (ii) establish
responsibility for payment of existing debt service until all outstanding
loans are fulLy repaid; (iii) define the broad objectives of SNEL's tariff
policy such that SNEL can cover from its own resources operation and
maintenance costs and renewal and expansion of its assets; and, (iv)
transfer the Inga II hydroplant and Inga Shaba line to SNEL at a transfer
price based on their value in use (para. 3.14).   During negotiations,
agreement was also obtained that beginning in 1987, SNEL would cover from
its own resources all operating and maintenance charges associated with the
Inga II hydroplant and Inga Shaba transmission line and reimburse over a
ten-year period a portion of the original debt related to construction of
the Inga II hydroplant corresponding to its value in use.
Institutional Assistance to SNEL
3.16          To assist SNEL in upgrading its management capabilities,
substantial institutional assistance has been provided under CR.1224-ZR.
As part of this program, several studies and assistance activities have
been launched including an analysis of electricity tariff issues, a study
of asset revaluation, establishment of a planning unit, and rehabilitation
and improvement of the data management unit and computer system used for
data analyses, accounting and budgeting. The tariff study was completed in
mid-1985; asset revaluation will be completed by mid-1986; and the planning
unit was started in May 1984 (para. 3.13).   The data management study,



-30-
which started in November 1982, was initially intended to be directed
mainly to computer problems, but was extended with IDA's approval to a
general management assistance program.  A review of technical assistance
received recently by SNEL was undertaken by a joint IDA/CCCE mission in
March 1986. In addition to a general evaluation,9/ the mission identified
the major problems SNEL encountered with technical assistance programs and
prepared  recommendations  to  assist  SNEL  in  finding  solutions.    The
conclusion of the evaluation was that many positive results had been
achieved since intensive management and organizational assistance was
introduced in 1982, but that execution of new programs and systems had
experienced setbacks because of a lack of physical and human resources.
Actions taken in the 1982-1985 period are described in Annex 3.4.   The
second phase of the general management assistance which began under CR
1224-ZR will be extended under the proposed project in the areas of
personnel management, procurement and inventory control, accounting and
internal control procedures and will be directed towards two axes: (i)
consolidation of the basic information and management systems; and (ii)
dynamization of SNEL through planning, responsibility, motivation and
training. Intensification of human resource development activities will
also be undertaken to develop a long-term training plan and initiate
manpower planning.   During negotiations agreement was reached with SNEL
that it would: (i) obtain within the proposed project (para. 4.05 and
Annex 4.1) the services of eight qualified experts for a period of two
years; (ii) prepare by July 31, 1986, an interim action plan for the
resumption of training activities for technical personnel as well as
managers, consult with IDA on its results and no later than September 1,
1986, implement the plan as agreed with IDA; and (iii) reinforce the
existing institutional assistance for human resources to develop a Training
Master Plan which will be completed in draft form and furnished to IDA for
comments by November 1, 1986.
IV. THE PROJECT
Preparation of the Project
4.01      Rehabilitation and Extension Needs in the Kivu Region.  Following
the initiation of the Ruzizi II Regional Hydroelectric Project (para. 1.11)
and with the prospect of a significant increase in the amount of electric
power available to the Kivu region of Zaire (para. 2.17), the Government is
proceeding with the rehabilitation and extension of the transmission and
distribution  facilities  and  also  rehabilitation  of  the  Ruzizi  I
hydrostation  to  make  optimal  use  of  power  within  the  regional
interconnected system.   Burundi and Rwanda have taken similar parallel
steps with IDA assistance (para. 2.18).   IDA received and subsequently
approved on May 10, 1983 a request from the Government of Zaire for an
advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF P246) in the amount of
US$440,000 to carry out the following studies in preparation for the
proposed project:
(a) feasibility of the rehabilitation needs of the Ruzizi I hydro-
power plant;
9/  This  evaluation  covered  the  financial  and  commercial  systems,
supply/purchasing, structure and organization, human resources and
training.



-31-
(b) feasibility of the rehabilitation and extension of the transmis-
sion and distribution network in the Kivu region; and
(c) feasibility study for the construction of a wood-fired plant at
Mbandaka in the Equateur (North) region.
SNEL retained the services of ICN which has completed its reports. On the
basis of the consultant's recommendations, the Government requested IDA
financing for the rehabilitation and expansion of the generation,
transmission and distribution facilities in the Kivu region. As a result,
a mission visited Zaire in November 1984 to appraise the proposed project.
In order to expedite the project, the Government requested that the PPF
advance be raised to US$1 million so that it could retain consultants for
the design, call for and analysis of tenders. The extension was approved
on October 1, 1985.
4.02        Wood-Fired Plant at Mbandaka.  During the preparation of the
project, IDA also agreed to include in PPF P246, the feasibility study for
the construction of a wood-fired power plant at Mbandaka in the Equateur
(North) region, because no feasible hydro site has been identified in the
area and a wood-fired station may be the least-cost option. Consultants
(EdF International) concluded in their report dated February 1975
(Annex 7.1) that a 6 MW wood-fired power station was not competitive with
respect to a diesel extension. 10/
4.03       Preparation of Supplemental Rehabilitation for the Shaba Power
System and Emergency Repairs for the Inga Complex.   Preparation was
undertaken during supervision of Credit 1224-ZR and is based on reports of
the consulting engineers (ACEC/Tractionel) and the panel of experts
(HydroQuebec) convened at the request of IDA (para. 2.08 and Annex 4.1).
Project Objectives and Relation to the Sector
4.04      The main objective of the project is to ensure a reliable supply
of electrical energy to the two main interconnected networks of
Inga-Bas Zaire-Shaba and the Kivu region. The project will also serve to
make use of electrical energy within the Zaire (Kivu)-Rwanda-Burundi inter-
connected system by increasing the transmission and distribution cape ity
of the network in the Kivu region where there is much suppressed deand and
to strengthen SNEL as an institutiorn through better management, plann'ng,
rational pricing, improved financial policies and training of it-s staff.
Project Description
4.05        The main features of the project are given in Annex 4.1 and
summarized as follows:
10/ The main reason for the negative conclusion is that the area studied
around the town of Mbandaka is particularly marshy and subject to
flooding. About 70% of the area is hydromorphus soil, unusable for the
exploitation of the natural forest and also for plantation.   This
weighed heavily on the operating costs.

I. Rehabilitation and extension works:
- rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I hydropower plant (complete
overhauling of the generating units, construction of stator
windings, relays, signalization);
- rehabilitation and expansion of the transmission and distribution
network in the Kivu region and interconnection with the Ruzizi II
110 kV tranamission network (rehabilitation of the 6.6 and 15 kV
distribution network and extension of the 15 kV lines in four
towns--Goma, Bukavu, Uvira, Kiliba-i.e. construction of about 83
km of new MV and 150 km of new LV lines; and construction of a 70
kV 17 Ikm antenna line from Ruzizi I-Bujumbura line and 70/15 kV 5
MVA substation for the supply of Kiliba and Uvira);
- completion of the rehabilitation of the Shaba power system
(further repairs to generating units, replacement of speed
regulators, replacement of the shaft of the unit No. 4 (65 MW) at
Nseke, repairs and replacement of the valves at Nzilo and Nseke
dams);
- emergency repairs and operational improvements for the Inga I and
Inga II hydropower facilities (supervision, procurement and
installation  of equipment and  spares  responding  to highest
priority needs over the next eighteen months);
- radio-communLcation equipment for urgent operational needs of
SNEL (high frequency equipment to be installed at Kinshasa, Inga,
Lubumbashi, Bukavu and Kisangani):
II. Technical and institutional assistance to SNEL including studies
(continuation of the institutional general management assistance
in personnel, financial, commercial, procurement, planning;
studies on revaluation of assets, audits, tariffs; preparation of
a contract for the transfer from the Government to SNEL of
ownership rights of assets financed and presently owned by the
Government but operated by SNEL; study on urban household energy
needs; employment of eight qualified experts); and,
III. Assistance for SNEL's training needs (rehabilitation of existing
facilities, continuation of services of the senior training
consultant, advance training of instructors at Sanga or abroad;
installation of equipment for training in the operation and
maintenance of diesel plants; Annex 4.2).
Cost Estimates
4.06        The total project cost is estimated to be US$41.9 million,
excluding duties and taxes, from which the project is exempt, and excluding
interest during construction. The foreign exchange component is estimated
to be US$37.6 million, or about 90% of the total project cost.   The
estimated cost of the principal components of the project are given in
detail in Annex 4.3 and summarized In the Credit and Project Summary.



-33-
Basis for Estimates
4.07      The cost estimates for the consulting services, technical assis-
tance and training have been prepared by IDA, while the costs of the other
components have been estimated by SNEL's consultants, ICM and Tractionel.
These cost estimates were reviewed by IDA and were found to be reasonable.
Base costs are in March 1986 price levels. Physical contingencies of 10%
were added to each component to provide an allowance for unforeseen
increases  in  the  volume  of  work.    The  Bank's  present  estimate  of
international price increases for manufactured goods was used for price
contingencies on foreign costs, as follows: 1986, 7.2%; 1987-1988 6.8%; and
1989: 7.0%. In view of the Government's flexible exchange rate policy, all
project costs have been expressed in US$ and the assumption made that the
progressive devaluation of the Zaire currency would compensate for p. ice
increases in local costs.
Financing Plan
4.08       The proposed IDA credit of US$37.0 million would finance about
88% of the estimated project cost of US$41.9 million and about 98% of the
estimated foreign currency expenses (US$37.6 million) of the project, in
both cases excluding interest during construction, which will be paid by
SNEL in local currency. The UNDP will finance part of the cost of training
activities (US$0.6 million). Interest during construction related to the
IDA Credit is estimated at US$6.5 million and will be financed by SNEL in
addition to all local currency expenditures (US$4.3 milion).   A summary
fundiag plan appears in the Credit and Project Summary.
4.09      The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be onlent to SNEL at 8.5%
for a period of 20 years including five years' grace. SNEL will assume the
foreign exchange risk. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be (i) the
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement 'tween SNEL and the Government;
and,  (ii)  the  execution  of  UNDP's  agi-ement making  the grant  funds
available to SNEL.
4.10          SNEL would finance through cash generation, local currency
requirements of about US$10.8 million equivalent (22% of the project total
cost, including IDC).
Status of Engineering and Implementation
4.11           SNEL would be responsible for the implementation of the
rehabilitation and extension components of the project and would be
assisted by engineering consultants. SNEL has signed engineering contracts
with ICM of Germany (the consultants for the initial feasibilitv studies;
para. 4.01) for rehabilitation of Ruzizi I and rehabilitation and expansion
of the Kivu transmission and distribution network; and with Tractionel of
Belgium for rehabilitation of the Shaba power system.   These consultants
are acceptable to IDA and during negotiations, agreement was reached that
SNEL would continue to employ consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA and in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines for
the  use  of  consultants.    Physical  works  would  be  carried  out  by



-34-
contractors.    The preparation of  the  preliminary  designs  and  tender
documents  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  by  September  1,  1986,
rehabilitation and extension of the Kivu distribution network by end-1988
and rehabilitation of the Shaba power system and the Ruzizi I Power Plant
and by end-1989 as shown on the implementation schedule (Annex 4.4). These
schedules appear reasonable in view of the fact that the work to be
performed does not require construction of major structures.  Bids have not
yet been received.    However,  as  the contracts will  include  commonly
purchased material and equipment, and erection services would be routine in
nature, riskz of having cost overruns are estimated to be small.
Procurement
4.12          Societe Nationale de Trading.   The Government,  aware of
procurement problems in all its public enterprises, sought to address them
through the creation in March 1985 of a central procurement agencv, the
Societe Nationale de Trading (SONATRAD), to serve five large public
enterprises,  including  SNEL.11/       SONATRAD's  mandate  is  to  permit
substantial improvements in procurement through improved negotiation
techniques,   grouping   orders   from   several   public   enterprises,
standardization of common equipment, elimination of certain purchasing
intermediaries, diversification of the sources of supply, and promotion of
competitive local producers. Extensive discussions have taken place since
March 1985 between the Government, SONATRAD, SNEL, GECAMINES and the Bank
to develop SONATRAD into an institution that can eFfectively play its role
of improving the procurement practices of the public enterprises involved
and to clearly spell out in acceptable bilateral contracts the respective
roles and responsibilities of the public enterprises and SONATRAD.   A
Purchasing Agreement (Annex 7.1) signed on April 6, 1986 between SNEL and
SONATRAD and approved by the Government, elaborates SONATRAD's role in the
following areas: (1) to serve as SNEL's purchasing agent for a limited
number of large contracts (above US$3.0 million for 1986) and for contracts
of equipment common to sereral public enterprises and where substantial
savings can be expected from grouping of orders; (ii) to control and audit
SNEL's purchasing practices, with particular emphasis on commercial
intermediaries, sta-ndardization, and monopoly situations; and, (iii) to
advise SNEL on purchasing procedures, knowledge of the equipment market,
and generally upgrade SNEL's purchasing skills. The Government, SNEL and
SONATRAD have agreed to a review of the threshold every six months and for
assurances that it could not be changed without prior Bank's approval. The
Purchasing Agreement between SNEL and SONATRAD is a satisfactory document
which adequately addresses the weaknesses of the present system.   The
parties have also agreed that SNEL will monitor SONATRAD's performance as
its purchasing agent and that quarterly external audits would apprise SNEL
and SONATRAD of the quality of implementation of the Purchasing Agreement.
4.13       General.  Some of the items to be purchased under the project,
particularly for the rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I and Shaba power plants
and at Inga I and Inga II power plants are proprietary in nature and can
only be supplied by the original manufacturer. Thus, it would be necessary
11/ GECAMINES, SNEL, REGIDESO, SNCZ, ONATRA.



-35-
for SNEL to negotiate directly with the original manufacturer for the
supply and guarantee for any installation of these types of equipment. The
total cost of items to be purchased in this manner is estimated to be
around US$5.0 million.   Nevertheless, attempts will be made to obtain as
broad a response as possible for the supply of this type of equipment, and
the possibility of requesting proposals for substituting equipment from
other suppliers will be investigated. This method was approved and applied
under CR 1224-ZR The general contractor for the installation and erection
works for the Shaba Power System Rehabilitation was appointed in accordance
with Bank guidelines.   Other materials and equipment, including erection
services, to be financed by the proposed IDA Credit would be purchased in
accordance with IDA's guidelines for international competitive bidding.
Procurement for cofinanced items of the project would be in accordance with
the colender's normal  practices.    Consultants  would  be  selected and
employed in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA
on the basis of Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants whose
extension of service will be paid from the proposed Credit. Consultants in
charge were all selected in accordance with the Bank guidelines (e.g.
institutional assistance: Sema-Metra-Sobemap-para. 3.16; engineering for
the rehabilitation of the Shaba Power System: Tractionel-paras. 1.10 and
2.20; engineering for the Ruzizi I power plant and Kivu system:
ICM-para. 4.01).    Urgent rehabilitation needs of the hydroplants would
require that contracts be placed and some payments be made in advance of
credit effectiveness.    The  total amount  of  retroactive  financing  is
estimated at a maximum of about US$750,000.   A tabulation indicating the
method of procurement of the various components is given in Annex 4.5.
Disbursements
4.14        The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed over five
fiscal years as follows, to finance:
(a) repayment of the PPF advance (US$1.0 million) for the preliminary
engineering study and detailed design and preparation of contract
documents;
(b) 100% of the foreign costs of the engineering services, technical
assistance and studies (US$10.1 million);
(c) 100% of the foreign currency expenditures and 90% of local
expenditures financed contracts for materials and works for the
rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I, Shaba and Inga hydro plants
(US$12.2 million), rehabilitation and extension of the Kivu
transmission and distribution networks and Ruzizi II feeder
(US$11.2   million)    and    radio    communication    equipment
(US$0.09 million); and
(d) unallocated funds totalling US$2.41 million.
4.15      As the 17 km, 70 kV branch line to supply Kiliba and Uvira will
originate from a tower located in Burundi and a portion of this branch line



-36-
will be built in that country, it was agreed with SNEL that disbursements
for expenditures for the Uvira and Kiliba portions of the project would be
subject to the Government of Zaire and SNEL obtaining from the Government
of Burundi sufficient rights to permit free access to Burundi for the
construction, operation and maintenance of this branch line.
4.16       Claims relating to any contract or purchase order whose value is
less than US$20,000 will be submitted under statements of expenditures, the
documentation for which will be retained at SNEL headquarters and made
available for inspection by IDA supervision missions.   All other claims
will be fully documented.   The closing date for the credit would be
December 31, 1990.   The disbursement profile (Annex 4.6) differs from
standard profiles of average power projects since funding is provided
mainly for rehabilitation and extension of transmission and distribution
networks (a limited portion of a complete power project including
generation) and institutional and operational technical assistance to
SNEL.   The schedule is reasonable. A Special Account of US$1.0 million,
financed under the Project, would be established in an account to be opened
in a commercial bank for the purpose of alleviating SNEL's difficulty in
pre-financing expenditures to be reimbursed under the IDA Credit, and
operated under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The special account
would be replenished on a monthly basis on the basis of withdrawal
applications  submitted  by  SNEL  and  acceptable  to  IDA.    Should  any
disbursements be made from the special account which are not acceptable to
IDA, SNEL would deposit the corresponding amount into the Special Account.
Agreements on terms and conditions for using the Special Account were
reached at negotiations.
Project Monitoring
4.17        The records and reports necessary to monitor progress of the
project and its evaluation were agreed upon during negotiations.   The
proposed detailed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in
Annex 4.7.  The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1990.
Preparation of a project completion report not later than six months after
project completion was agreed during negotiations.
Environmental Considerations
4.18      The construction of the transmission and distribution facilities
would use commonly known and well-tried practices.   The effect on the
environment would be as minimal as in other areas of the country.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past and Present Situation
5.01      As noted in paragraph 3.11, SNEL's accounts and accounting system
have been the focus of extensive technical assistance intended to improve
internal consistency and control. An analysis of SNEL's audited 1984 and
unaudited 1985 results is given below, but should be interpreted with



-37-
caution since the 1984 accounts contain numerous revisions of anomalies
related to previous years based upon the auditors' recommendations and the
1985 results are based on preliminary results of an asset revaluation study
still under review by IDA, SNEL and the Government (para. 5.04).   SNEL
continues to receive assistance to improve its accounting practices.
5.02          Operating results for 1984 and  1985,  based  on available
accounting data, are summarized in Table 5.1.
5.03       The results of SNEL's operations for 1984 yield a rate of return
of 8.5% on net fixed assets. This rate of return is not representative of
SNEL's financial situation which is distorted by (i) the recording of most
of SNEL's assets at their historical costs, and (ii) the inadequate
depreciation charges for these assets.
5.04       An improvement in SNEL's cash generation in 1985 resulted from
several rate increases throughout the year.  However this improvement is
negated, producing a negative rate of return for 1985 of -1.2%, when
adjustments are introduced which: (i) revalue SNEL's assets to reflect
their utility value;12/ (ii) value the Inga II and the Inga-Shaba line
based on use (30% of replacement cost for Inga II and 0 for the Inga-Shaba
line (para. 3.14) rather than at the arbitrarily low value utilized in
1984; (iii) increase depreciation charges in accordance with the new asset
values, and (iv) incorporate substantial one-time adjustments to operating
costs recommended by the auditor and reflecting anomalies in earlier
accounts. Results for 1985 should be regarded with caution since they are
based on preliminary results of the Helios asset revaluation study which is
subject to modification following discussion with SNEL and the Government.
Review of the revaluation study will be completed by end 1986 and
incorporated in the accounts of that year, and finalization of asset
transfer will be completed by mid-1987. Principles for the transfer price
and financial charges for Inga II and the Inga-Shaba line were agreed
during negotiations and SNEL's 1987 accounts wouiid be adjusted on the basis
of that agreement in accordance with accounting practices acceptable to
IDA.
5.05        The financial position of SNEL as of December 31, 1984 and
December 31, 1985 is shown in Table 5.2.
5.06         SNEL's low debt equity ratio at 11/89 for 1984 reflects a
practice by which the Government has financed nearly all infrastructure and
social investments in the power sector.   Once in operation, these assets
have been transferred to SNEL's accounts and the Government has continued
to pay the corresponding debt service.   Budgetary constraints will prevent
the Government from continuing to bear all debt service on SNEL's behalf,
requiring SNEL to assume increasing responsibility for financing power
sector investments.   For 1985, based on the Helios study (para. 5.04),
SNEL's debt equity ratio increased significantly as 30% (Annex 5.4 D(a))
12/ Replacement cost adjusted for exchange rate variation, wear and
utilizable capacity.

of the loan for financing Inga II and a loan for the Katana-Goma
transmission line were transferred from the Government to SNEL. However,
SNEL and the Government need to set forth in a legal agreement future
responsibility for financial charges, including debt service, for
Government financed assets transferred to SNEL as a capital increase
(para. 3.15). Before undertaking new investments, SNEL and the Government
will, as part of the agreed financing plan for the investment (para. 3.15)
specify their respective debt service obligations. Under this arrangement,
SNEL would not incur debt unless the internal cash generated for the twelve
months preceding incurrence of the debt is at least 1.5 times the maximum
debt service requirement for any succeeding year.
5.07      SNEL's receivables have been declining largely due to an ongoing
program to identify overdue consumers and improve collection, and were
equivalent to 6.4 months of sales at the end of 1983, and 4.7 months at the
end of 1984 compared to an average of 10 months for the 1980-82 period.
Government arrears at mid-1984 represented over 50X of payments
outstanding.   The general situation improved further in 1985 with total

and 2.5 months sa_es by end-1988 and thereafter.   In order to reduce
Government receivables to achieve these levels, SNEL and the Government
would agree on an action program including (i) improved Government budget
estime;es for electricity purchases prepared with SNEL's assistance; (ii)
more efficient verification, transmission and payment procedures; and,
(iii) a timetable for implementing a level payment plan. Submission of the
action program would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness.



-40-
Tariff Level
5.08       Present electricity tariffs (Annex 5.5), last raised in October
1985 (low voltage 20%, medium voltage 33%), and March 1986 (GECAMINES HV.
22%) were adequate to meet SNEL's requirements for operating expenditures,
debt service and capital expenditures only under the arrangement by which
the Government incurred substantial debt service on SNEL's behalf.  On the
basis of SNEL's forecast capital investment program and the requirement
that SNEL self-finance an increasing proportion of this program, financial
projections show that substantial rate increases will be required in the
future   to  prevent  deterioration  of  SNEL's  financial  performance
(para 5.11). Assuming annual local price escalation rates of 25% for 1986,
20% for 1987, 17% for 1988, 15% for 1989-90, and 12% for 1991 and
thereafter, the level of electricity rates in real terms would be higher
each year than the 1986 level and would ultimately reach the level
equivalent to the preliminary estimates of the long-run economic cost of
energy in Zaire in the mid-1990's (para. 6.06).
5.09        A study of SNEL's tariffs carried out by EdF, financed under
CR 1224-ZR (Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project ) and completed in
mid-1985, recommenied the introduction of marginal cost pricing based on
time-of-day peak/off-peak rates. However, costs had been derived from an
overly optimistic damand forecast and investment program which have since
been revised downward (para. 3.13). The report was reviewed by SNEL, the
Government and IDA, and its recommendations for an inverted block tariff
and differentiation for the interconnected hydro-based and isolated thermal
syetems have been introduced. Additional study of lifeline rates, regional
differentiation and revised LRMC will be determined by an updating study
once the long-term development plan is finalized (paras. 3.13 and 6.06).
Following an exchange of views with IDA, SNEL would promptly implement the
recommendations of the tariff study as agreed under Credit 1224-ZR.
Future Financial Position and Operations
5.10       The projected financial statements of SNEL for the years 1986
through 1992 together with notes and assumptions used in these statements
are shown in Annexes 5.1 through 5.4.  Projected balance sheets for the
years ending December 31, 1986 through 1992 show that the current assets/
current liabilities ratio during these years varies between 1.3 and 2.1.
In the past, this ratio has been very high due to large amounts tied up in
receivables. As mentioned in para. 5.07, efforts are underway to reduce
the level of receivables and the expected results are reflected in the
satisfactory level of the future current ratio. The debt/equity ratio is
projected to rise to 42/58 in 1986 and average 35/65 over 1987-92 which is
an acceptable level.   In 1985, the Government of Zaire initiated the
practice of on-lending to SNEL at a rate of interest exceeding the rate at
which the Government borrows; terms are negotiated on a case-by-base
basis.    As  a  result,  SNEL's  present  borrowings  are  comprised  of
concessional loans (0-2% interest) passed on by the Government with no
supplemental interest plus recently negotiated loans averaging 15 years
repavient at rates of interest varying between 7 and 11 Z per annum.  In



-41-
order to gradually move toward a policy of onlending at commercial terms,
the practice of Government relending of concessional loans should be phased
out, and onlending at a rate exceeding the Government borrowing rate should
be continued. During negotiations, agreement was reached that all grants,
credits and loans obtained by the Government for the purpose of financing
SNEL's 1985-92 investment program would be onlent to SNEL at a rate of
interest of no less than 5%; SNEL would in all cases assume the foreign
exchange risk.
5.11      To meet the future operating and debt service requirements and to
make a reasonable contribution to its construction program from internally
generated funds, SNEL would require timely tariff revisions. Based on the
financial projections detailed in Annex 5.1, rate increases would be
required at the rates of 86%, 24%, 22%, 15%, 15% and 14% respectively from
1987 to 1992. The large rate increase needed in January 1987 is due to the
proposed elimination of Government subsidies (for operation of the SIS and
borrowings on SNEL's behalf (para. 3.14)).  This increase would raise the
average rate from its present level of Z 0.705/kWh (UStI.1/kWh) to Z 1.481/
kWh (UtM2.1/kWh), which is still low compared with other countries of the
region and the estimated LRMC of USt5.0). In view of the magnitude of this
increase, it is recommended that the adjustment be made in phases in line
with Zaire's present economic stabilization and recovery program. For the
remainder of 1986, the Government has approved an average increase of 13Z
taking effect July 1 for commercial LV and MV rates, September 1 for HV
rates and October 1 for residential LV custouers, bringing the new average
rate to Z 0.795/kWh (US tl.3IkWh). In 1987, the 86% increase over the 1986
level will be phased with increases in HV rates in March and September and
LV and MV rates January 1 and July 1. The principle of semi-annual review
and adjustments was agreed with the Government and SNEL during negotiations
to improve SNEL's financial situation and avoid large increases which have
occurred in the past due to delay in approval of adjustments. During
negotiations agreement was obtained that SNEL will take all measures
required including the adjustment of the structure and level of its
tariffs, to produce for each of its fiscal years beginning in 1986, funds
from internal sources equivalent to about 30% of the annual average of
capital expenditures incurred or to be incurred during that year and the
two next following fiscal years; before July in each of its fiscal years
SNEL would, on the basi0 of forecasts satisfactory to IDA review the
adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirement for cash generation against
capital expenditures and furnish to IDA a copy of the review upon its
completion.
5.12        The projected operations of SNEL indicate that its financial
performance would be satisfactory for the years 1986-92 based on projected
sales and costs and the tariff levels resulting from the proposed covenant
with debt service coverage varying between 1.5 and 2.5 times; the operating
ratio (excluding depreciation) decreasing from 0.59 in 1986 to 0.38 in
1992; and net cash contribution to investment varying between 20% and 33%.
Proposed Financing Plan
5.13      A detailed funds flow statement for SNEL is shown in Annex 5.2.
A summary for 1986-90 is given in Table 5.3.



-42-
5.14         During the project period, 1986-90, SNEL's construction and
renewal program is estimated to cost Z39.6 billion (US$508.4 million),
including interest during construction of Z 2.9 billion (US$37.2 million).
About 6Z of the total construction program relates to the proposed
project. This program is, however, subject to revision following review of
the long-term development plan (para 3.13).
5.15        After covering debt service, internal cash generation would
provide about 30% of the funds required for construction expenditures and
working capital requirements during the 1986-90 period. About 97% of all
foreign exchange expenditures are assumed to be financed from external
financial sources.  Borrowing would provide 67% of SNEL's total required
funds.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Kivu/Zaire-Rwanda-Burundi Regional Interconnected System Investment Program
6.01       Least Cost Solution.  Construction of the Ruzizi II generating
station is now underway and Zaire is committed to provide one third of the
cost of the project (para. 1.11 and 2.27).   It has also entered into a
contract with SINELAC to purchase sufficient power to cover one third of
the cost of operation, maintenance and debt service, and without the
rehabilitation and extension of the distribution networks in the Kivu area,
Zaire could not distribute power from the generating station and meet the
forecast demand for electricity. The mission has reviewed the consultants'
reports (Annex 7.1) and is in agreement with the recommendation that the
least-cost method for Zaire of meeting the forecast demand in the
Zaire(Kivu)-Rwanda-Burundi interconnected system is by rehabilitating the
Ruzizi I hydroplant in the short-term and rehabilitating and extending the
distribution networks in the Kivu area. The proposed project is a part of
the regional development program.
6.02      Return on Investment.  The economic rate of return on the power
program has been calculated as the discount rate at which the present value
of the capital and operating costs of the program equals the present value
of the incremental benefits, expected from the development program. The
ERR for the regional development program was determined as 8.9Z excluding
consumers' surplus and 13.4% including consumers' surplus, in the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 4303-EAF, dated May 5, 1983.  Based on assumptions
detailed in Annex 6.1, the economic rate of return on the regional
investment program was recomputed to be 8.8%.  By taking into acount the
economic benefit (consumers' surplus) deriving from the availability of
hydropower rather than higher cost diesel generated power which it is
estimated some 15% of consumers would be ready to buy, the economic rate of
return was determined to be 11.5%. In this case benefits for this portion
of sales were based on alternative costs of d'lesel generation (economic
cost of diesel oil in the region estimated at US$600ltonne). The rates of
return have been found to be comparable tn those given in the original
Staff Appraisal Report.  The economic rates of return are sensitive to
changes in costs and revenues. Results are summarized in Table 6.1. The
economic rates of return are acceptable.

Rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I Hydro Power Plant
6.03         Return on Investment. If the existing deficiencies in the
Ruzizi I plant are not remedied soon, total replacement of most of the
electromechanical equipment in a few years would become inevitable. It is
assumed that the costs of such major replacements would amount to roughly
US$500 per installed kW or US$14.1 million (in March 1986) prices. Taking
into account the surplus generating capacity which will exist in the
regionial  interconnected  system until  1992,  replacement  units  of  the
Ruzizi I station would need to be commissioned by this date. The economic
rate of return on the US$7.5 million rehabilitation expenditures (base cost
+ physical contingencies - engineering servic.s including the feasibility
study) proposed under the project would be 21.1%.  This does not account
for any losses from increasingly unreliable operation during the
intervening period.   Details are given in Annex 6.2 and sunmmarized in
Table 6.2. In all cases the economic rates of return are acceptable.

Rehabilitation and Extension of the Distribution Networks in the Kivu Area
6.04      Return on Investment.  The economic rate of return for improving
the capacity and reliability of the distribution system has been calculated
based on added revenues from measured sales. It is estimated that without
rehabilitation, the distribution capacity (estimated to be around 17 MW; 50
GWh/year) would decrease by about 5% per year in the 1987-1991 period. To
make up for the deficit which would result, some of the consumers would
utilize their diesel units.   13/   As th3 effect of this would be to
increase the ERR, these sensitivity runs have not been done and no
13/ As a minimum, those operations (farms, workshops, cottor and tea
factories, etc.) that do have standby diesel units (totaling 1,056 kVA;
850 kW) would have to use them more to make up for the lack of
capacity. It is expected that about 1.7 GWh/year of diesel generation
will be substituted by hydro-based electricity supplied from the
regional interconnected system.



-45-
adjustments in the benefits were taken into account for the likely greater
availability  (in  capacity  and  reliability)  of  electricity  through
distribution facilities versus the diesel plant capacity utilization
(maintenance and fuel supply problems and foreign exchange needs for diesel
oil). The project also includes extension of the distribution networks to
a capacity of about 35 MW expected to be reached around year 2000. Net
revenues from the forecast sales were determined using long-term marginal
costs for Kivu  (Annex 6.4).   Based on the foregoing assumptions the
economic rate of return was calculated as 15.6%.   Annex 6.3 contains
details  on  the  foregoing computations  and assumptions.    Results  for
sensitivity studies are summnarized in Table 6.3.   The economic rates of
return are acceptable.

Tariffs and Long-Run Marginal Cost
6.05        While future electricity pricing is projected to meet SNEL's
financial requirements (para. 5.08), all past financial and economic costs
have not been covered owing to large uneconomic investments in generation
(Inga II) and transmission (Inga-Shaba line) which exceed the capacity of
the consumer to finance and therefore have been and will continue to be
subsidized by the Government.  The present tariff structure includes an
element of cross-subsidization of low voltage residential   consumers who
pay less than medium voltage consumers in spite of higher cost/kWh for low
voltage power, particularly when high supply cost regions (supplied mainly
by small thermal and hydro plants) are subsidized by low supply cost
regions through a uniform national tariff policy for low voltage
residential rates.   Medium voltage industrial users also benefit from
theregion-l subsidization of a uniform national tariff but only during
critical hours of consumption (Annex 5.5).  SNirL's move to marginal cost
pricing is likely to bring significant increases in the cost of low voltage
power, which for social reasons could not be immediately and fully
reflected in the tariff to household consumers; some differential in
contribution above the cost of service by the other user categories may
therefore  be  necessary.    Maintaining  uniform  national  tariffs  has
discouraged investment as well as efficient operation in high cost regions
which are perceived   by SNEL as a burden on its finances; virtually no



-46-
maintenance has been carried out on isolated diesel plants which are very
often operated at low capacity as a cost saving measure.  Negotiable MV
rates for operation exceeding critical hours are being tried to determine
the  effectiveness  of  differentiated  cost-based  tariff.    Should  this
experiment prove successful, SNEL will consider complete regional
differentiation in tariffs for allindustrial and commercial customers, and
as far as practicable for household consumers with consumption rates in
excess of a fixed minimum.
6.06         Consultants (EdF International) have undertaken a study of
marginal cost pricing for power based on estimated load forecasts and a
preliminary investment program prepared by SNEL and peak/off-peak
variations.  However, SNEL's investment program appears ambitious in light
of capital constraints and its load forecasts optimistic in view of past
experience, and IDA has proposed a downward revision (para. 3.13). based
on the reduced investment program and load growth, the LRMC of power is
estimated to be about US.5.0.   It is assumed  that SNEL would adopt
progressive tariff increases such that its average tariff would approach
the LRMC by the mid-1990's (para. 5.11). Funds would be provided under the
proposed project to update the LRMC study once the long-term development
plan is completed in mid-1986 (Annex 4.1).
Rehabilitation of the Shaba Power Plants and Transmission System
6.G7         Return on Investment.   The economic rate of return is the
discount rate at which the present economic value of the project and
operating costs equals the present value of savings and revenues expected
to be obtained from the project.   rhe ERR for the Shaba Rehabilitation
Project was determined as 16% in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 3400a-ZR
dated March 15, 1982. As costs and tariffs have changed since then, the
ERR was recomputed.  The benefits are computed as the revenues from the
sale of electricity which is available due to the rehabilitation program.
The ERR is estimated to be about 12% and it is acceptable. The reason for
the decrease in the ERR is that project costs increased and completion and
therefore realization of benefits of the project are delayed.  Armex 6.5
contains details on the foregoing computations and assumptions.
Project Risks
6.08       The physical risk associated with the rehabilitation and exten-
sion components of this project and risks of higher costs due to receiving
bids after presentation to the Board are small because detailed inspections
were carried out for the power plants and the work to be completed for the
distribution  networks  is  routine  and  only  proven  elements  would  be
included.    The main risk would be institutional in nature, as SNEL is
generally weak in administration and project management.   However, this
risk would be minimized by provision of compete.it consultants to assist
SNEL in carrying out the project and SNEL would continue to receive
management  assistance  to improve  its performance  (Annex  4.1).        An
additional risk relates to the Government's willingness to adopt rational
investment planning and pricing policies for the sector.  Government has



-47-
demonstrated a commitment to improving its performance in these areas by
seeking advice through the Energy Assessment and engaging in a dialogue on
pricing  and  financial  policy  reforms,  preparation  of  a  long-term
development plan, and comnitting itself to exchanging views with IDA in the
future (para. 1.13).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower
chat:
(a) it would conclude with SNEL by '.ne 30, 1987 an agreement to (i)

capacity is fully committed and investments in additional
facilities for the supply and delivery of electricity are
required (para. 2.22);
(c) during preparation of SNEL's long-term development plan, the
timing and financial impact of the Kinshasa elentrification
program on SNEL and the Government would be examined to determine
the optimal phasing of the program and to limit investment in
accordance with that phasing; IDA, the Government and SNEL would
exchange views and agree on the best way to proceed with the
program (para. 2.24);

(f) SNEL would, prior to undertaking any investment in the power
seL.-r greater than US$5 million, submit the investment to IDA
for approval along with an economic and financial justification
and agreement on the Government and SNEL's obligations for
financial charges (para. 3.13);
(g) beginning in 1987, SNEL would cover from its own resources all
operating and maintenance charges associated with the Inga II
hydroplant and Inga-Shaba transmission line and reimburse over a
ten year period a portion of the original debt related to
construction of the Inga II hydroplant corresponding to its value
in use (para. 3.15);
(h) SNEL would prepare by July 31, 1986 an interim action plan to
resume tiaining activities for technical personnel and managers
and following an exchange of views with IDA begin implementing
the plan by September 1, 1986 and would furnish by November 1,
1986 to IDA for exchange of views a draft long-term Master Plan
for training (para. 3.16);
,i) SNEL's accounts would be adjusted in accordance with standard
accounting practice and in a manner acceptable to IDA to reflect
the agreements reached between SNEL and the Government on the
transfer price and ftnancial charges for Inga II and the
Inga-Shaba line (para. 5.04);
Cj) SNEL would not incur debt unless internal cash generated for the
twelve months preceding incurrence of the debt is at least 1.5
times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding
year (para. 5.06);
(k) it would conclude with the Government an action program ro reduce
receivables such that receivables would not exceed 4 months'
sales by end-1986, 3 months' sales by end-1987 and 2.5 months'
sales by end-1988 and thereafter (para. 5.07); and,
(1) SNEL would take all measures including adjustment of the
structure and level of its tariffs required to produce for each
of its fiscal years beginning in 1986 funds from internal sources
equivalent to about 30% of the annual average of capital
expenditures incurred or to be incurred during that year and the
two next following fiscal years (para. 5.11).



-49-
7.03      As special conditions of Credit Effectiveness:
(a) a subsidiary loan agreement would be signed by the Government and
SNEL setting the terms and conditions of onlending the IDA Credit
(para. 4.09);
(b) the colender's agreement wuld be executed (para. 4.09); and,
(c) SNEL and the Government would furnish to IDA the action program
for the reduction of receivables (para. 5.07).
7.04       With the above agreements, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of SDR 37.3 million (US$37 million).

ZAIRE
SECOND POWER PROJECT
Energy Resources
1.         Zaire's major energy resources are hydropower and forests; it
possesses oil and coal resources which are mostly unexplored and only
partially exploited, as well as shale deposits, the methane gas of Lake
Kivu (shared with Rwanda), uraniurs, geothermal deposits and solar energy.
2.         Hydropower.  Hydropower *Ls Zaire's major energy resource and is
the source of 98Z of its electricity. The total hydropotential of Zaire is
estimated at 740,000 GWh, roughly half of Africa's hydropotential.
Although only 1.1% of the potential is developed (11,000 GWhla) Zaire is
feced with a large surplus of installed capacity (total generation was only
4,800 GWh in  1985).   The ri-2erutilizazion of the installed capacity
Cconcec.trated in western Zaire),when the major areas of the country are
sporadically served or not at all, is a cause of concern to the Government,
which is considering several alternatives to increase power consumption.
3.         Forest and Biomass Resources.   Wood and other biomass fuels are
the principal sources of energy for the population and are extremely
valuable resources to Zaire, which is the most heavily forested country of
Africa. Forests cover some one hundred and twenty-two million hectares,
more than one-half of Zaire, and are grouped in three main areas. These
are the Mayumbe forests in Bas-Zaire (240,000 ha); the Central Basin
equatorial forests in the Equateur, Haut-Zaire and Bandundu regions (101
million ha) and the peripheral forests including Shaba savannan, forest
strips and dense mountain forests in Kivu (21 million ha).
4.         Total primary pntential resources based on the growth rates are
evaluated at 66 million toe/year. An extremely precise and detailed forest
inventory is being carried out for the central basin by a Zario-Canadian
team with the objective of rationalizing exploitation.   The volume of
ascessible wood per species and regeneration rates are to be deduced from
the data. Natural accessible forest growth yield is currently estimated at
about 150 million cubic meters per year, i.e. 10 million toe, :n the
central basin alone (assuming conservative growth rate of 2.5 cubic meters
per hectare per year). An estimated 155,000 cu3 woodwaste annually comes
from the sawmills, and its use as an industrial heat and power source and
for producing domestic charcoal have been tested successfully.
5.           Bagasse from sugar-mills, rubber waste from the crepe-rubber
plants and palm-fruit waste from the oil mills are presently utilized as
biow8ss sources with potential for further development.

6.        Petroleum Exploration and Production.  Oil was discovered in the
Coastal Basin in 1970 and production began in  1975.   In  1983 Zaire
extracted 9.3 million barrels of crude oil from the Coastal basin, 90% of
production from offshore fields exploited by Zaire-Gulf Oil (under an
exploration convention granted by the Government in 1969) and about 1OZ
from the on-shore field. Because of its high fuel oil content this crude
cannot be refined economically in Zaire's present facilities in Moanda
(capacity: 750,000 t/yr).  Based on the findings from recent exploratory
wells, production is expected to increase to 3.4 million barrels in the
onshore section and to 14 milion barrels in the offshore section by 1986.
Thereafter overall production may decline, unless further reserves are
identified.
7.         Limited exploration was carried out in the Congo Central Basin
prior to 1981 with little success; new surveys and reinterpret -tions are
underway. An airmag survey of Zaire's third sedimentary basin the Great
Lakes Basin, or Tanganyka Graben, was carried out in conjunction with
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania financed by ongoing Bank Group operations.
Following a promotional meeting held in November 1984, several companies
have expressed interest pursuing exploration activities.
8.         Coal.  Coal is exploited in two areas in Zaire:  the open-pit
mine of Luena in Shaba (reserves estimated at 20 million tons) and the
underground mine of Lukuga (reserves estimated at about 700 million tons)
north of Kalemie.  The coal is low grade and has a high ash content.
Production, mainly from the Luena deposit, has been decreasing steadily
since 1980 because of lack of spare parts and is now about 99,000 tons per
year, whereas 135,000 tons of higher quality coal per year are imported by
Gecamines.  A third coal deposit, the reserves of which have not been
estimated, is said to exist at Walikale, north-west of Lake Kivu.  The
economic evaluation of extraction and transportation options would be the a
logical next step in analysing potential use of coal; a consultant's study
on these issues is being reviewed within the Bank at present.
Other Resources
9.        Methane.  Lake Kivu, which belongs to both Zaire and Rwanda, has
a unique methane gas potential in its deep waters. In 1975 both countries
agreed to create a joint company which wGuld allocate concessions and
participate in all exploration activities.   Potential markets - power
generation, fertilizers and chemicals, fuel for small vehicles and industry
- all require heavy investment and large operations for economies of scale,
but initial small-scale activity is necessary to allow monitoring of the
effects of exploration in the lake's environment.   A pilot extraction
installation (1963) at Cape Rubona has been rehabilitated to a production
level of 3,000 to 6,000 cubic meters per day.   Electrogaz  (Rwanda)
commissioned a study of the feasibility of expanding Rubona's production to
15,000 m3 per day and their report dated March 1984 recommending the
expansion is under consideration in the Bank. Electricite de France (EDF)
is carrying out prefeasib-ility studies for a plant at Kabeke to produce 20
million cubic meters of methane per year (total investment ECU 50 million).

10.       Oil Shales and Tar Sands.  Reserves of 100 to 120 million tons of
oil shale are located in the Kisangani basin . Their crude oil content per
ton is estimated as between 60' and 100 liters, but further technical and
cost studies,  are needed.    In Bas-Zaire,  reserves  of tar  sands  are
estimated at 2.5 billion tons.  Experimental drillings have been done in
the asphalt sands of Mayumbe and a feasibility study of investment in
bitumen facilities in the SOZIR refinery has been studied.
11.        Geothermal Potential.  This has not been exhaustively assessed
but Northern Shaba and Kivu are said to have resources. A small geothermal
installation (peak capacity of 275 kW) has supplied the Bukena mine with
power and water since 1953. Large scale exploration does not appear to be
economical in the foreseeable future.
12.           Uranium.   Zaire has exported uranium from the Centre de
Recherches Nucleaires in Kinshasa since at least 1967, but the reserves,
estimated to be between 4,000 and 8,000 tons, have never been published.
Production of electricity from nuclear sources in Zaire is not under active
discussion.

Communaute 6conomique des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL)
1.        The Communaute &eonomique des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL), is an
organization which was established in September 1976 by Burundi, Rwanda and
Ze?'re to revive the former cooperation among the three countries which
existed under the Belgian administration prior to independence. CEPGL was
formed to promote free movement of persons and goods within the area, and
to cooperate politically and economically within the region as it relates
to other countries in Africa.   The entity is made up of a council of
ministers, one from each of the countries, which meets twice a year and
reports to an annual meeting of the presidents of the three countries - the
highest authority of the organization. The day-to-day activities including
the preparation and execution of programs and coordination within the
administration of the three countries is handled by a Secretariat located
in Giseny'., Rwanda. CEPGL receives assistance from USAID, France, Belgium
and FED for the preparation of feasibility studies.
2.           CEPGL has sponsored a glass bottle manufacturing factory in
Burundi, and in June 1981, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
approved a loan of US$4.0 million and an equity investment of US$0.75
million for its construction. The factory was placed in service in 1983.
Another activity is exploring the potential for the production of methane
from the deep waters of Lake Kivu.    Several issues need to be resolved
before an investment program for gas development can be defined; for
example, the legal and institutional framework for gas extraction by Rwanda
and Zaire; the safety limitation and the establishment of the rate at which
the gas can be extracted; and the nature and the extent of the market and
the derivative products. The potential contribution of the development of
gas to this area is still in the distant future.
Energie des pays des grands lacs (EGL)
3.         EGL was set up to ensure the availability of electric power in
the region, and as a result has promoted the construction of the Ruzizi II
hydroelectric power project on the Ruzizi River downstream from the
existing Ruzizi I generating station on the border between Zaire and Rwanda
(Map IBRD 18989).   This organization, located in Bujumbura, Burundi, is
staffed with three technical directors - one each seconded from REGIDESO,
Burundi; ELECTROGAZ, Rwanda, and SNEL, Zaire; together with a small support
staff.

Societe Internationale d'Electricitg des Pays des Grands Lacs (SINELAC) -
The Regional Implementing Agency of Ruzizi II
4.          The three Governents of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire in February
1984 ratified their agreement to form the international company, SINELAC,
to be the regional implementing agency of the Ruzizi II project.
5.             SINELAC, with its head office in Bukavu, Zaire 1/ is an
international public company established for a 50-year renewable period,
and the three Governments of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire contribute equally
to its capital. Although SINELAC has been formed initially for the Ruzizi
II  project,   it  could  acquire  and  manage  other  electric  power
installations. SINELAC is governed by the rules of the agreement and its
own by-laws, and for cases that are not covered by these rules and
regulations by the Investment Code of the Communaute &eonomique des pays
des grands lacs (CEPGL), and by the laws of the country of its
headquarters, Zaire.   SINELAC would operate as a commercial entity with
financial objectives defined initially in relation to the project and its
electricity tariffs would be established at a level which wucld produce a
satisfactory rate of return for the project.
6.        SINELAC is governed by a General Assembly consisting of the three
Ministers of Energy.   This General Assembly meets once a year and its
responsibilities are to appoint or dismiss the directors, the general
manager, the account controllers (commissaires aux comptes) and the
auditors, and to discuss the financial statements of each previous year.
The Board of Directors consists of six members, two from each country. A
three member management committee is in charge of SINELAC's day-to-day
operations. SINELAC's General Manager is appointed by the General Assembly
and the Board of Directors has the responsibility of appointing and
removing the other two members of the management committee.   The three
members of the committee would be from different countries.   SINELAC
consults with IDA before appointing a new general manager.
1/ SINELAC will operate from Bujumbura, Burundi until 1987, when the
construction of its headoffice will be completed.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Existing Generation, Transmission and Distribution
Facilities in and Exports from the KCivu Region
I. Existing Facilities
Generation
The Ruzizi I hydroelectric station (28.2 MW) serves the Goma, Bukavu
and Uvira areas of the Kivu region, which utilize about 11 MW of the power
generated (40Z of capacity); the remainder is exported to Rwanda and Burundi.
The scheme was built in 1956-1958 on the falls at the exit of the Ruzizi river
from Lake Kivu and consists of a concrete gravity type dam 14 m high and 180 m
wide, and a powerhouse with four turbo-generator units at the bottom of the
dam.  Two 6.3 MW units were comidissionned in 1958 and the last two units of 7.8
MW each were put into service in 1972. The power station suffers from a lack of
adequate maintenance and shortage of spare parts. Until March 1985, the town of
Goma in the northern part of the Kivu region was supplied by a diesel plant with
total installed capacity of 1.2 MW, but capable of producing only 300-500 kW and
a limited amount of power was imported from the Gisenyi hydro plant in Rwanda.
With the commissioning of the 110 kV Katanga-Goma transmission line (presently
being operated at 70 kV), in March 1985, Goma is also supplied frcm the
interconnected system.
Transmission
A 70 kV transmission line from the Ruzizi I power station presently
supplies Katana where a cement plant (45,000 t/a) built in 1958, but
stopped since the 1960s, will be rehabilitated and recommissioned in
1988-1989; a branch line also supplies Bukavu where the main consumer is a
brewery with an electric boiler of 8 MW. In March 1985, the line was extended
from Katana to Goma, financed by the Government of Yugoslavia.  Another 70 kV
transmission line, owned and operated by SNEL, crosses Rwanda to supply
Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi.  The Bujumburr 70/6.6 kV, 2x5.25 MVA and
6.6/15 kV, 1 MVA substation and a 15 kV line from Bujumbura to Uvira are
presently owned and operated by SNEL which intends to transfer the latter to the
Burundi national power company, Regie de distribution d'eau et d'electricite
(REGIDESO) of Burundi. The transmission system in the region, which dates from
the  1960s  has  received  sporadic  maintenance  but  requires  only  minor
rehabilitation.
Distribution
The total length of the 15 kV and 6.6 kV distribution line in the
towns of Bukavu, Uvira and Goma is 245 km; 0.4 kV distribution network amounts
to 232 km. The line lengths show that priority was given to the supply of large
consumers (industries, workshops) rather than individual household consumers.
The old parts of Bukavu are supplied by cables directly from the 6.6 kV busbars
of the Ruzizi I power station while the newer districts are supplied by cables
and lines of 15 kV through 6.6/15 kV, 10.4 MVA transformers. The 6.6 kV network

ANNEX 2.8
Page 2 of 2
is very old, improperly maintained, overloaded and in need of renewal.
Distribution in Uvira and Goma is also made by 6.6 kV cables which are very old
and limited to the central districts of the two towns. In Goma, a new network
of 15 kV is also being commissionned.
II. Exports
Past Exports
The interconnected network benefits primarily Rwanda and Burundi
through exports from Zaire, although SNEL has imported small amoents of
power from Rwanda for Goma. The general export trend has varied with the coming
on stream of new plants and hydrological fluctuations.   Exports to Rwanda
increased 3ubstaatially in 1979-1981 period when the Ntaruka hydro plant in
Rwanda (11 MW, 20 GWh/a) was insufficieut to meet the demand, but decreased
following the commissioning of the Mukungwa hydrostation (2x6MW, 48 GWh/a) in
Rwanda in January 1982. Exports to Burundi increased gradually until 1981 when
Ruzizi I was the only plant supplying Bujumbura, Burundi's capital and principal
electrified area. With the commissioning of the Mugere hydrostation in Burundi
in 1982 (8 MW, 41 GWh/a), exports to this country also decreased. However they
increased once again in 1984 to meet the relatively large demand of a new glass
factory which was commissioned in end-1983.   In 1985, because of a favorable
hydrology, Mugere was able to generate all year round and the utilization of the
glass factory was low; therefore exports to Burundi decreased once again. While
national resource development is an important part of Burundi and Rwanda's
strategy of reducing dependency on foreign sources for the supply of electricity
aimed at expanding the power sub-sectors, recently all three Governments
recognized the advantages of least-cost development on a regional basis and
agreed to jointly construct the Ruzizi II regional hydro power project.
Interconnections with Ruzizi II Project
The power generated at the Ruzizi II power plaat presently under
construction will be transmitted through new 110 kV lines.   The power to be
transmitted to Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda will arrive at the new Mururu II
substation on the Zaire-Rwanda border near Ruzizi I.  The existing Ruzizi I
70-kV system and the new Ruzizi II 110-kV system will be interconnected at this
substation through a 110/70 kV 10 MVA transformer which is being provided as
part of the Ruzizi II project.  The short interconnection line between Mururu
II-Ruzizi I will also be constructed within the Ruzizi II project; the 70 kV
terminal at Ruzizi I will be installed within the proposed project.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
General Management Assistance to SNEL
Fir-t Phase of the Assistance: Data Management Study
SNEL signed in November 1982, a contract with SEMA-METRA/ SOBEM&P
(SMISOBEMAP)  to  restructure  its  acounting  and  commercial  computer
organization and procedures. Although the work was intended to be directed
mainly to computer problems, it has tended to be rore towards
organization. During the year 1983, SNEL's computer centre was reorganized
by SOBEMAP so that there would be a one to one relationship between a
customer division and the centre,  and staff were trained.   As a new
experiment, incentives were given to key staff, with positive results,
which shows that crompetent local staff can be motivated by proper rewards.
The purchase of nei computers was approved to cope with future work load,
and it was ordered in June 1984; 9] the computers will be operational in
1985.
Also in 1983 much organizational work was accomplished in the
financial department, with regional computerization of general accounting
and consolidation at headquarters, establishment of individual accounts for
suppliers, personnel, projects, customers, and of simplified cost
accounting. Accounting procedures were written with the help of Helios and
manuals were prepared for easy future updating. More than 150 accountants,
cashiers and bookkeepers from all regions underwent training at Sanga,
SNEL's training centre, and all accountants were tested to evaluate the
strength of the regional accounting organizations.   But the main task of
1983 was the inventory of all HV/LV transforming stations in Kinshasa,
coding of Kinshasa streets, reorganization of the billing process and the
inventory of all customers in Kinshasa; a comprehensive investigation was
carried-out with the assistance of a full-time consultant.   It achieved
satisfactory results, as it was shown that about 15% of identified
customers were not billed and corrections of deficiencies would result by
end-1984 in an increase of 26% of the energy and 49% of the amounts
invoiced, either because customers were billed incorrectly, insufficiently
or not at all.

Second Phase of the Study: General Management Assistance
Difficulties encountered during first year implementation, mainly
because of lack of competent staff, emphasized the necessity for timely
starting up of the second phase of the organizational technical assistance
as provided in Section 2.03 of the Project Agreement for CR 1224-ZR. In
May 1984, SNEL and the Bank agreed on a second phase covering actions in
four main areas:
(i) personnel, for staff file organization, completing of job
descriptions, definition of training and orientation of staff
to positions and study of ways to motivate people by a higher
salary, premiums, and benefits of some kind;
(ii procurement and inventory control, for establishing detailed
procurement procedures and precise rules for inventory
coutrol;
(iii) financial, for completion of the asset register established by
Helios in the revaluation study, preparation of computerized
assets management and d;-finition of rules for project
accounting and transfer of work in progress to fixed assets;
and
(iv) management control, for establishing management indicators and
devising the principles of cost accounting to provide for
their   preparation,    and   definition    of   rules   and
responsibilities for signatures of internal memos and outgoing
mail,   to  correct   delays  resulting   from  the  present
disorganization.
Staff motivation is crucial in this plan of action, because there
are competent people in SNEL and elsewhere, but they cannot be interested,
attracted or kept without a framework within which they could be
stimulated. SNEL has created a Service of Organization and Methods (BOM)
under the Secretary general, to be composed of about 30 staff from S.N.EL.
and to be recruited outside or to be supported by expatriate staff, who are
responsible for the conception and the implementation of the project, and
who would be paid as project officers and thus would not besubject to
SNEL's conventional salary grid.
Evaluation of the Technical Assistance Programs Received by SNEL
A joint IDA/CCCE mission undertook in March 1986 the evaluation
2/ of the technical assistance programs received by SNEL since 1982 and
identified the major problems encountered by SNEL, prepared recc'umendations
to assist SNEL in finding solutions. The final report of the mission is
not ready yet but a detailed Aide-Memoire was left with SNEL.
2/ Covering the financial and commercial systems, supply/purchasing,
structure and organization, human resources and training.

ANNEX 3.4

The conclusion of the evaluation was that many positive results had
been achieved since intensive management and organizational assistance was
introduced in 1982, but that execution of new programs and systems had
experienced setbacks because of a lack of physical and human resources.
SNEL management devoted several meetings to discussion of i mediate actions
It could take to reorient ongoing activities and to complete preparation of
human resource/training components being considered for the proposed
Energy I Project. The priority areas signalled by the mission which should
receive emphasis under the proposed project and future Energy I project
include:
i) Finance. The new accounting system adapted in 1984 is not
really operational as evidenced by the delays and anomalies which still
plague SNEL's accounts. The major bottleneck is that SNEL staff have not
mastered the system and require additional basic and system-specific
training.   The first priority is 'to make the numbers viable-.  Further
introduction of analytical accounting and finance systems should not be
considered until SNEL's accounts become dependable. The limited training
for accounting and finance staff included under the proposed Power II
Project will need to be broadened under Energy I.
ii)   Commercial.   The various client inventory and collection
programs are generally sound, but the maintenance of these systems has not
been adequately provided for.   Staff and logistical support is needed to
manage billing records, client accounts, etc. The connection department,
the key link of ongoing and future distribution programs, is technically
weak and could compromise commercial improvement efforts. Logistical
support   and   efficiency   improvements   for   connections   (possibly
subcontracting to private firms) are likely candidates for Energy I.
iii) Purchasing and Supply. Implementation of well-conceived and
designed supply and inventory control is blocked by lack of physical
facilities   (warehouse   improvement   and   construction   is   stopped).
Insufficient number of staff have been assigned to inventory goods.
Material and equipment losses are high. SNEL will take measures to finish
construction and rehabilitation; but assistance will be needed to implement
the purchasing and supply control program. Training of staff, particularly
in the area of procurement will be necessary.
iv)   Human Resources.   An excellent base for evaluating and
classifying personnel has been established as a first step to introducing
the new organizational structure. The next steps include the execution of
a recruitment strategy, normalization of professional qualifications and
the development of a Personnel Master Plan.  The activities will begin
under Power II, but are likely to need continued expertise under Energy I.
v)   Training.   The preparation and execution o; the interim
training plan (1986/87) will fully absorb the limited resources of the
training division staff and no work on a long-term plan will be possible
without the immediate strengthening of the T/A team.    As tne logical



80
ANNEX 3.4
Page 4 of 9
extension of the human resources activities is a longer term training plan,
existing T/A for human resources (SEMA/SOBEMAP) will be reinforced to
complete the Personnel Master Plan and develop from it a Training Master
Plan. The latter should be well advanced by appraisal in order for Energy
I to carry out a human resource planning and development program in line
with execution of the Plan Directeur de Developpement.
Based on the recommendations, greater emphasis will be placed on
(i) skills transfer and appointment of counterparts to progressively
decrease dependence on T/A and (ii) training (in the areas of accounting,
finance, procurement, computing).   Consideration will also be given to
providing the logistical support (micro computers, transportation) needed
to master and sustain the various systems and programs.
The  successful  implementation  and  continuation  of  management
improvements will depend to a large extent on the motivation of SNEL' s
staff. To this end, SNEL's salary and benefit structure, which is under
review, will need reform to ensure competitiveness and motivation of its
staff, as it appears that SNEL does not presently compare favorably with
other major parastatals.

SOCIETE NATIONAL D'ELECTRICITE (SNEL)
SECOND POWER PROJECT
Description of the Project
I. Rehabilitation and Extension Works
Ruzizi I Hydroelectric Power Plant
1.         Consultants (ICM) carried out a detailed inspection on the state of
the dam, powerhouse and equipment and concluded that the installation was
functioning but that reliability was very low owing to deficiencies from (i)
lack of maintenance and spare parts; and (ii) the degradations and modifications
which occurred over time such as sedimentation in the reservoir, fractures in
the concrete and corrosion in the penstocks. The fractures in the concrete are
not of a kind and level to jeopardize the operation of the plant; however, close
monitoring is necessary and instrumentation will be provided as part of the
project.   Works for the generating units will cover windings,  relays and
signalization, complete overhauling of the units and the construction of the
stator windings. The consultants concluded that if the rehabilitation was not
carried out urgently, most of the electromechanical equipment would need to be
replaced later with a cost far exceeding the proposed rehabilitation. The total
cost  of  this  rehabilitation  component,  including  physical  and  price
contingencies and engineering services, is estimated at US$8.5 million of which
US$7.8 million would be in foreign currency.
Transmission and Distribution network in the Kivu region
2.         Detailed inspection of the network and substations revealed that the
overhead transmission lines of 70 kV and 15 kV require only minor
rehabilitation.   In Bukavu,  the old 6.6 kV distribution network would be
completely replaced by new 15 kV cables and lines while the 15 kV network could
be rehabilitated; extensions to new districts would be made with 15 kV cables
and lines. The old 6.6/0.4 kV transformers would be rehabilitated and used in
Uvira. The industrial district would be connected to the existing 70/15 kV; 10
MVA substation at the Bralima brewery. In Goma, SNEL is commissioning a 15 kV
distribution ring which will supply the center and industrial district; urgent
rehabilitation work was carried out in this town in the second half of 1985 in
order to transfer to 15 kV a few consumers who are still supplied from the old
6.6 kV network. The 6.6 kV line from Goma to Sake would be upgraded to 15 kV.
For the supply of the Uvira and Kiliba areas, a 70 kV antenna line of about 17
km from the existing 70 kV Ruzizi I-Bujumbura line and 70/15 kV 5 MVA substation
would be built at Kiliba on Zairian territory.   All transformers and other
substation equipment would be inspected, rehabilitated and/or overhauled
according to needs.   The new 15/0.4 kV substations would be built in two
standard cabinet or pole-mounted designs.   Distribution networks in Bukavu,
Goma, Uvira and Kiliba wil' also be extended to supply the new districts. All
new 0.4 kV overhead lines would use preassembled cables with extra conductors
for public lighting.  In addition to the rehabilitation works, about 83 km of
new medium voltage lines and cables, about 150 km of new preassembled low
voltage cables will be constructed.  Lastly, a 70 kV terminal to interconnect
the existing Ruzizi I system with the Ruzizi II transmission system will be

installed at Ruzizi I power station switchyard. It is estimated that the total
cost of this component (including contingencies and engineering services) would
be US$14.1 million of which US$12.7 million would be in foreign currency.
Shaba System Rehabilitation
3.             Supplementary material and works identified during the ongoing
rehabilitation (Credit 1224-ZR) include: (a) further repairs to the turbines,
generators, hydromechanical and electrical systems in all four generating
stations identified during the shutting down and dismounting of the units; (b)
modernization of the turbine speed regulation systems; (c) replacement of the
shaft of the unit No. 4 (65 MW) at Nseke power station; (d) repair and
replacement of the valves at Nzilo and Nseke dams; (e) additional installation
works by the general contractor; and (f) engineering services for the
supplementary works. Revised estimates of costs and revised financing plan for
the Shaba Power Rehabilitation Project are given in Table 1 of this Annex. The
total cost of this component, including physical and price contingencies and
engineering services, is estimated at US$6.2 million of which US$5.2 million
would be in foreign currency.
Emergency Repairs and Operational Improvements for the Inga i and Inga II
Hydropower Facilities
4.        The Inga I power plant commissioned in 1972 provides partial supply to
Kinshasa  and  exports  power  to  the Congo.    Preventive maintenance  of  the
facilities has been minimal because of lack of foreign exchange for spares and
tools. With assistance of Italian Government financing, SNEL has undertaken a
limited rehabilitation program at this plant, supervised by ENEL engineering
consultants. The Inga II plant, commissioned in 1982, has a 1,424 MW capacity
of which only 200 MW used for partial supply of Kinshasa, the mining industry in
Shaba and power exchanges with Zambia.  As uniits ar both power stations were
designed with respect to a much higher load forecast, their underutilization
resulted in destructive  cavitation phenomena.   The operating personnel has
limited itself to urgent and indispensable repairs and often has to use material
taken out from other units.   Three consultants (ICM, CIS and HydroQuebec)
carried out three separate inspections of the dam and power plants.   The
services of the first two were financed by SNEL, while those of HydroQuebec were
financed from the funds of CR 1224-ZR.  All three concluded that the state of
the plants required rehabilitation and managerial strengthening. Their reports
are included in the Project File (Annex 7.1).   The panel of experts from
HydroQuebec, reviewed all previous studies and inspection reports and carried
out a detailed diagnosis of the hydrofacilities and the Zairian Interconnected
System (Inga-Bas Zaire- Kinshasa a.c. power system/Inga-Shaba D.C. line/Shaba
a.c. power system). The parnel has strongly recommended: (i) limited but urgent
measures for civil works structures; (ii) complete rehabilitation of Inga I
units; (iii) addition of instruments and equipment to establish synchronous
operation of the Inga-Bas Za're-Kinshasa a.c. system with the Inga-Shaba d.c.
line; and (iv) rehabilitation and relay installation to initiate a load-shedding
program in the Shaba region which would minimize disturbances to GECAMINES. The
proposed project includes the supervision, procurement and installation of
equipment and spares responding to highest priority needs over the next eighteen
months. The remainder of works and comprehensive rehabilitation in both power
p'lants and the interconnected system would be taken up in the centext of the

proposed energy project now being prepared. Tne total forecast of the emergency
repairs and operational Improvements are estimated at US$2.4 million out of
which US$2.0 million would be in foreign currency.
Radio-commmnication Equipment for SNEL
5.         The high frequency radio-communication equipment needed for improving
and strengthening the conmmunication channels between headquarters and principal
regional centers would be installed at Kinshasa, Inga (control center for the
Bas Zaire-Kinshasa-Shaba interconnected system), Lubumbashi (head office of the
Southern region), Bukavu (head office of the Kivu subregion) and Kisangani (head
office of the Eastern region of which Kivu is a subregion).  It is estimated
that the equipment would cost US$0.1 million of which US$90,000 would be in
foreign currency.
Consulting Engineering Services
6.            Consulting engineering services would cover the preparation of
detailed project and bid documents, evaluation of bids and construction
supervision for the rehabilitation and extension works. The total cost of
engineering services, including services carried out for the feasibility studies
is estimated to be US$3.0 million of which US$2.9 million would be in foreign
currency.
II. Technical and Institutional Assistance to SNEL
7.                   Within  the  Shaba  Power  System  Rehabilitation  Project
(CR  1224-ZR),   technical  and  institutional  assistance  is  provided   to
SNEL co strengthen accounting and management control systems, prepare a
long-term development plan, revalue assets and to carry out a tariff study.
SNEL's current management performance is much improved compared to 1981 when IDA
lending to SNEL was initiated, due in part to the intensive inputs by tile
consultants ard expatriate management staff.   Further technical assistance is
included in the proposed project for the following:
(a) continuation of the institutional general management assistance
particularly in personnel, financial, commercial and procurement
activities;
(b) continuation of the assistance in the establishment and training
of the planning and revisions in 1987 and !988 of the power
development plan and investment programs;
(c) Levisions of the assets revaluation studies;
(d) audits of SNEL's 1985, 1986 and 1987 accounts;
(e) an update of the 1984/85 tariff study;
(f) an audit of the operation of SIS and a study of the long-term
options of the SIS and tapping stations;

ANNEX 4.1
Page 4 of 5
(g) pre-feasibility   studies  for  those  projects   included  in  the
long-term power development plan;
(h) preparation of a contract for the transfer from the Government to
SNEL of ownership rights of assets financed and presently owned
by the Government but operated by SNEL;
(i) studies of urban household energy needs, supplies and feasibility
of various options (to be supervised by SNEL on behalf of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy); and,
(j) services of eight qualified experts for a period of two years starting
from July 1, 1986, as summarized below:
(i) one expert in power system planning to continue assisting
SNEL in the establishment and training of the planning unit;
(ii) four experts in finance to continue helping SNEL to strengthen
its commercial services and its finances (one financial advisor
in Kinshasa headquarters, one financial expert in Lubumbashi to
be responsible for the Southern region, one commercial expert in
the Kinshasa region and one financial expert in charge of
management of the SNEL's treasury);
(iii) two experts in organization (one expert in personnel management
and one expert in organization and data management services) to
help SNEL setting up a new organizational structure and a new
personnel management policy; and,
(iv) one expert in power transmission to help SNEL liaise with the
panel of experts for Inga I and Inga II hydro power facilities
a-d to review and implement its recommendations.
These experts will coordinate for SNEL the work of the general management
assistance consultants mentioned in (a) of this paragraph.   The total cost,
including  contingencies,  of  this  component  is  estimated  to  be  US$8.8
million of which US$8.1 million would be in foreign currency.
III. Training
8.           No technical training activities have been taking place for the
last three years at SNEL's training center at Sanga owing to the lack of
expertise to organize and operate the facilities.   Established in 1976, the
training center requires minimal rehabilitation, management support and
training of the twelve instructors.   SNEL needs to take the following short
and  medium  term  measures  in  order  to  ensure  the  proper  operation,
maintenance and management of its facilities by skilled staff: upgrading of
staff skills by advanced and on-the-job training, occupational adaptation,
occupational change,and acquisition and issuance of equipment and tools
required by operating units. Details are given in Annexes 4.2 and 7.1. SNEL

has recently signed an agreement with EdF International for the services in
1986 and 1987 of a training consultant who will prepare and implement an
interim action plan for short-term (1986-1987)training needs. The services
of the consultant are financed from the CCCE loan which cofinances the
Shaba Power System Rehabilitation project with IDA (CR 1224-ZR) and
Belgium. Funds proposed under this project would cover part of the needs of
the interim action plan for training (to be prepared by July 31, 1986) and
would be used for:
(a) rehabilitation of existing facilities;
(b) installation of equipment for training in the operation and
maintenance of diesel plants;
(c) continuation in 1988 of the services of a senior training
consultant; and,
(d) advanced training of instructors at Sanga or abroad.
The total cost of this component, including contingencies, is estimated to
be US$0.8 million out of which US$0.7 million would be in foreign currency.
As the logical extension of the human resources activities is a longer term
training plan, the existing institutional assistance for human resources
would be reinforced to complete the Personnel Master Plan and develop from
it a Training Master Plan; to be completed and furnished to IDA for
comments, by November 1, 1986.

SOCIETE NATIONALE D'ELECTRICITE (SNEL)
SECOND POWER PROJECT
Survey of Training Needs for SNEL
Situtation
1.        In 1976, SNEL established a Permanent Training Center at Sanga to
train its staff in management and technical aspects of electric power
operations.    Until  1980, the  Sanga Training  Center  benefitted  from
technical assistance financed by France.  Owing to the departure of the
French experts and limited access to foreign exchange for materials and
equipment, training activities declined steadily and came to a halt in
1983/84.  Resumption of training is a critical necessity in view of the
skills shortage which in certain fields makes SNEL reliant on non-national
personnel.
Improvements to the Sanga Training Center
2.            Minor rehabilitation (US$100,000) and equipment acquisition
(US$330,000), technical assistance for management of the center and
training for Zairian instructors (US$220,000) are required to return the
center to useful operation in the short-term and to eventually transfer
its management and operation to SNEL staff.
Skills Upgrading Program
3.            Target groups, representing priority categories for skills
strengthening, include supervisory personnel/managers, foremen and skilled
operating personnel.
- Supervisory Personnel.   Short-term advanced training would be
given to staff in the areas of accounting, financial management
budgetary  control,   internal  auditing,  and  operation  and
maintenance  of  electric  power  facilities.    Training  would
emphasize on the planning, organization and implementation of
work,  technical mastery and reporting.   Medium-term  training
would focus on new technology and methods.
- Foremen.     Intensive  on-the-job  training  is  proposed  for
(i) administration and accounting services staff in the subjects
of management, budgetary controls and customer relations and (ii)
technical services staff for hydroelectric plant maintenance,
network rehabilitation, construction of low voltage networks,
and HV-MV transformers station operation.   Particular attention
will be given to coordinating with programs underway at Ruzizi
and in Kinshasa, Goma, Bukavu, etc. Medium-term training would
focus on advanced operating techniques and development of
awareness of foremen's responsibilities.



93
ANNEX 4.2
Page 2 of 2
- Skilled Operating Personnel. Short-term training is proposed for
plant  maintenance  technicians,  electricians  and  transformer
station  operators  already  in  service.   Medium-term advanced
training is proposed in the areas listed above as well as for
staff involved in distribution network construction, maintenance
and operation, and administration and accounting.
Interim Action and Master Training Plans
4.        An interim action plan to identify inter a'ia specific skills to
be reinforced, programs and manpower needs for 1986/87, is currently being
identified by SNEL and Electricite de France (financed by the CCCE under
the Shaba Power Rehabilitation Project, Cr.1224-ZR) with target completion
scheduled for July 31, 1986 and implementation to begin by September 1,
1986. Physical works completion and equipment installation at Sanga would
be done during the 1986/87 scolar year. SNEL will have its consultants on
institutional assistance prepare until November 1, 1986, a Master Plan for
Training, based on SNEL's master plan for performance.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
SOCIETE NATIONALE D 'ELECTRICITE
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
A. INFLATION.   International and local inflation rates used in  the
financial projections are shown below:
1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992 thereafter
International     -    7.2Z  6.8%  6.8%  7.0Z  7.1%    4%   4%        4%
Local             30%   25%   20%   17%   15%   15%   12%   12%       12%
B. REVENUES.   Sales and other revenues will be equal to the sum of (i)
operating expenses, (ii) debt service, (iii) working capital needs and (iv)
a reasonable contribution to investment requirements.
Sales revenues are based on yearly rate increases averaging 23% for 1986
and 86%, 24Z, 22Z, 15%, 15Z and 14% for 1987 through 1992 respectively.
Other revenues represent interest earned on bank deposits, charges for
customer services and connection fees. Increases for the 1986-1992 period
primarily reflect the growth in new connections for programed distribution
expansion.   Based on 8,000 new  connections completed in  1985, it is
expected that SNEL can maintain that level for 1986 and sustain a program
which augments by 2,000 new connections annually.
C . OPERATING EXPENSES
(a)  Salaries.   Efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency will
result in staff reduction from 4,700 in 1985 to a level of 4,500 in 1986,
which will remain constant throughout-the projected period. Salaries have
been adjusted to forecast inflation and an increase of 1% annually in real
terms to provide for upward mobility and merit remuneration.
(b)   Fuel.   (i)   No major investments in thermal generation are
programmed which would impact on fuel consumption.   Diesel fuel and
lubricant consdmption therefore reflects the expected longer operating
hours of thermal stations following Government approval of a negotiated
cost-based thermal tariff for extended operation of isolated plants and
actual operating norms of 0.30 1/kWh for diesel and 0.03 l/kWh for
lubricant.   (ii) The cost of gasoline for vehicle operation is based on
standards of 20 I/day for operational vehicles and 10 1/day for
administrative vehicles. Petroleum product costs are based on April 1986
prices (Z 26/1 for diesel and Z 30/1 for gasoline).   As prices were
decreased by 7% in April below their January 1986 levels, no further change
in prices is assumed for the remainder of 1986. From 1987 onwards, local
prices have been adjusted to compensate for the devaluation of the zaire
currency, assuming relative stability in the international traded price of
petroleum products.

ANNEX 5.4
Page 2 of 3
(c) Maintenance. Maintenance costs (primarily parts and materials for
facilities other than the Inga Shaba transmission line) are projected at 1%
of the gross value of revalued assets; an acceptable level to meet good
operating standards.
(d) Administrative Services and Supplies include general supplies and
services contracted from third parties, including maintenance of the
Inga-Shaba  line.    From  1987 onwards,  maintenance costs of  the line
(US$11 million equivalent in 1985) are expected to decrease by 19%
following a reduction in technical assistance through replacement bySNEL
staff.   All administrative costs are expected to increase in line with
local inflation from 1986 onwards.
(e)   Depreciation is charged at 3.0% of the value of revalued gross
fixed assets from 1986 onwards.
(f)  Taxes.  SNEL is not expected to pay corporate taxes due to its
substantial investment financing needs for which it will be solely
responsible beginning in 1987. Taxes for the projection period therefore
consist only of a statistical tax of 3% of the value of imported goods plus
entry duty on all non-eletrical materials.   Together, these charges are
estimated at a level of 3% of the foreign exchange cost of the construction
program and equipment renewal.
(g)   Interest expenses have been projected based on the terms of
existing debt and forecast interest of 8.5%.
D. BALANCE SHEET
(a)     Fixed  Assets  in  operation  were  revalued  by  consultants
(para. 5.04) as of December 31, 1985 on the basis of their utility value
(replacement value adjusted for exchange variation, wear and utilisable
capacity).    Fixed  assets  for  the  projection  period  (1986-92)  were
determined by (i) the transfer of completed construction and renewed
equipment in accordance with -SNEL's investment program (ii) annual
revaluation in accordance with international inflation (for 80% of the
asset base comprised of foreign pucchased goods or services) and local
price escalation (for 20% of the base representing the local input).
The transfer of the Inga II hydroelectric facilties to SNEL's
accounts has been related to the capacity utilization of the plant, e.g.
30% of the value of the plant was transferred in 1985, an additional 10% in
1988 and  1991,  respectively.    The Government  of Zaire  financed  the
construction of the facilities with a loan of US$380 million.  With the
gradual transfer of Inga II to SNEL's accounts, it has also been assumed
that SNEL will repay the original value of this loan: 30% of the loan is
shown in SNEL's accounts as a liability in 1985, 40% in 1988 and 50X in
1991 less repayments which are assumed to commence in 1987 over a ten year
period. The remaining value of the plant has been transferred to SNEL as
Government equity.

ANNEX 5.4
Page 3 of 3
(b)  Other  Assets  include  intangible  assets,  personnel  loans  and
advances on works in progress.   Because of the low degree of accurate
predictability for these values, they are assumed to remain constant.
(c)  Accounts Receivable are estimated to decline to a level of four
months' sales in 1986, three months' sales in 1987 and 2.5 months' sales in
is88 and thereafter.
(d) Inventory represents materials and supplies for plant operation and
maintenance estimated at about 1% of the gross revalued assets under normal
operation.
(e)   Other Current Assets is comprised of advances and credits for
maintenance and service contracts, prepaid expenses and social security,
and miscellaneous deposits.  A substantial decrease is expected for 1986
owing to new contracting arrangements for maintenance beginning in 1987.
Tne future value of these items is expected to remain at 20% of total
maintenance, contracted administrative services and personnel costs.
(f) Equipment Subsidy was eliminated in 1986 with the
expiration of bilateral agreements and the adoption of a policy of 100%
self-financing by SNEL (i.e. end of Government subsidization).
(g)  Accounts payable are projected at a level of 25% of contracted
fuel, administrative and consumable maintenance items.
(h) Advances and deposits pertain to consumer deposits for connections
and are projected at 3OZ of other revenues (generated from connection
charges).
(i)    Other  Creditors  and  Banks  includes  short-term  notes  and
miscellaneous accrued expenses. Short-term notes were liquidated in 1985.
(j) Other comprises unpaid taxes and charges due to Government.
E.   DEBT.   Long-term debt is expected to be obtained for the foreign
exchange cost of SNEL's 1986-92 investment program loans, credits and
grants to the Government and on-lent to SNEL at 8.5% interest. The loans
are assumed to be repayable in 20 years including three to five years
grace, depending on the construction period of the financed works, with
equal installments of princiapl.
F.  CASH.  Cash required for operations is assumed equal to one month's
operating expenses plus three months' debt service.  Surplus cash would
be used to establish a reserve for the short-term portion of long-term
deb;. pay dividends to the Government, or increase SNEL's contribution to
its investment program.

A rate of Z 3.68/kWh is applied to 28 diesel stations for
critical hours of operation varying from 3-16 hours per day depending on
the station.   Operation exceeding  the specified number of hours  is
negotiable between SNEL and consumers on the basis of SNEL's costs of

SECOND POWER PROJFCT
Economic Rate of Return Calculations for the Regional Investment Program
Assumptions: Project lives: 30 years
Demand forecasts:   Burundi: SAR for Power I Transmission and Distribution
Project (Report No. 5312-BU);   Rwanda: SAR for Power Project (Report No.
4961-RW); Zaire (para. 2.25 of this report); estimates giving for the region an
annual increase of 10% over the 1984-1995 period.
Sales of energy from Rwegura and Ruzizi II begin in 1988 and reach US$224 GWh
corresponding to full utilization of the facilities in 1995 (see page 3 of this
annex).
1.   Calculation of Benefits
A.   Without taking Into account consumers' surplus:
Resulting sales in Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire (Kivu) multiplied by the respective
forecast retail tariffs.
B.  Taking into account consumers' surplus:
The consumers in the region whose consumption represents about 15Z of the total
demand from Ruzizi II and Rwegura would be ready in case the Rwegura and Ruzizi
II projects were not built, to buy their electricity from a diesel-fueled
generating station, at a cost of at least UStl9.2/kWh.   1/   Either these
consumers would have an urgent need for electricity (hospital, water pumping,
Government agencies) or their demand is very inelastic (industries for which
electricity is a small part of their cost and which can pass the increase in
electricity cost to their customers, expatriates whose living expenses are paid
for, etc).
SDecific consumption of diesel oil: 0.320 kg/kWh 2/. Estimated average economic
cost of diesel oil in the region in April 1986: USt51/liter (US$600/tonne).

ANNEX 6.1
Page 2 of 8
Remaining of the forecast sales from Rwegura and Ruzizi II assumed to be paid
through forecast electricity retail tariffs. The demand curve for the region
could be drawn with two points (100% consumption at the average tariff, and 15%
at diesel cost), and a consumers' surplus could be calculated  that would
increase the benefits of the project.

diesel cost D
The revenue of the sale of Ruzizi II and Rwegura electricity is represented by
the area abcd, the value of which is TxQ. The theoretical surplus of consumers
ready to buy electricity up to the diesel cost D is represented by the area
above the tariff line limited by the demand curve:   ebcf.  To simplify the
calculation, we assume that the f4c curve is a straight line, thus the value of
the consumers' surplus is: 0.15(D-T)%? -- I 0.85(%D-T)Q - 0.575(D-T)Q.
With total incremental costs C and revenues TQ and the above
consumers' surplus, the economic rate of return is the discount rate at which
there is equilibrium between C and TQ + 0.575(D-T)Q - (0.425T + 0.575D)Q.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Basis for Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
of the Rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I Hydropower Plant
1.        The economic rate of return was computed as the discount rate at
which the present economic value of the project equals the present value of
savings to be obtained in not building the alternative of the project.
2.          The capital costs of the rehabilitation, spare parts and new
equipment (exclusive of the technical assistance and training components)
and of the alternative option have been estimated at March 1986 prices.
3.           The benefits are assumed  to be the savings from a major
replacement (the alternative project) which would be needed in the future
in case the rehabilitation is not carried out in 1986-1989.   In such a
case, -t is estimated that the station would need to be completely replaced
by 1992.
4.        Interest during construction and taxes were not included.
5.        The streams of costs and revenues are presented in the table on
page 2 of this annex.  The economic rate of return is calculated as 21.1%.
Results of the sensitiviy studies are stmmarized as follows:

Load growth 7.2Z p.a.                     12.7               10.6
In all cases the economic rates of return are acceptable.
6.         As shown in the table given in page 2 of this Annex, if the
rehabilitation project is not carried out in 1986-1989, then in 1991 a
deficit in the interconnected system would occur.   To make up for this
deficit, either the alternative project would be advanced to end-1991 or
some of the consumers would utilize their diesel units (it is estimated
that 15Z of the consumers would have their small independent diesel
units). As in both cases their effects would be to increase the ERR, these
sensitivity runs have not been done.

SOCIETE NATIONALE D'ELECTRICITE (SNEL)
SECOND POWER PROJECT
Basis for Calculation of Economic Rate of Return for the Rehabilitation and
Extension of the Distribution Networks in the Kivu Region
1.          The economic rate of return was determined as the discount rate at
which the present values of all incremental capital and operating costs and the
benefits and revenues attributable to the rehabilitation and development, are
equal. It is estimated that without rehabilitation, the distribution capacity
would decrease by about 5Z per year in 1987-1991 period.
Assumptions
2.        Project Life: 30 years
Costs as based on constant March 1986 prices.
Interest during construction and taxes not included.
Connection costs are paid by consumers as consumers' contributions
Cost of energy is taken from Annex 6.4: marginal cost of generation of
energy: USt 6.2/kWh sent out.
Losses assumed to be 13Z.
Operation and maintenance costs: 7Z of the investments.
Retail tarifs for Kivu assumed as the long run marginal cost for Kivu,
from 1988.
Benefits
Benefits were calculated with respect to electicity tariffs.
Sensitivity Studies
Sensitivity studies were carried out using different annual growth
rates for the expected sales and a project cost increase of 10Z. Results are
summarized in the following table:
Project Costs          Project Costs
Economic Rate of Return (Z)         as Estimated             up by 10l
Load growth in the Kivu Region
of 8.1% (base case)                   15.6                     14.4
Load growth in the Kivu Region
of 7.1%                               14.9                     13.7

Consumers' Surplus
Many consumers in the region would have used their existing
diesel units and would have installed new ones in the case the distribution
network is not rehabiliated and strengthened.  Consultants (ICM) identified
the diesel units existing in the Goma-Bukavu-Uvira-Kiliba area.  ji As
their effects would be to increase the ERR, these sensitivity runs have not
been done.
1/ Sugar mill in Kiliba: 250 kVA and 140 kVA
Economat general: 30 kVA and 40 kVA
Estagrico (cotton factory) 125 kVA and 160 kVA
2 hotels: 2 x 15 kVA
Katana hospital: 60 kVA
Agriculture research center in Inera (Katana): 41 kVA
3 tea factories: 3 x 60 kVA
Total about 1,056 kVA; (850 kW).
Average annual operation period: 2,000 h (load factor of 23%)
Specific consumption: 0.4 kg/kWh sent out

Marginal Transmission and Distribution Costs
4.        The proposed project would need to be complemented by 15 kV or
6.6 kV/0.4 kV substation investments which are estimated to be about US$0.7
million annually in 1990 and decreasing to US$0.4 million in 1994. Life of the
project: 30 years; operation and maintenance costs: 7% of the investment costs.
Without rehabilitation the distribution network's capacity would decrease by
about 5% per year between 1987-1991.  The proposed project would provide for
rehabilitation and extension of the distribution networks; the transmission
lines do not require extensive rehabilitation nor extension.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return for the
Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project
1.        The economic rate of return was determined as 16Z in the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 3400a-ZR dated March 15, 1982. As costs and tariffs
have changed since that date, the rate of return was recomputed.
2.        The economic rate of return is the discount rate at which the
present economic value of the project and operating costs equals the
present value of savings and revenues expected to be obtained from the
project.
3.        The capital cost of the repairs, spare parts and new equipment
exclusive of the technical assistance and training components are estimated
at March 1986 prices. The economic life of the project was assumed to be
15 years from the date it is completed.
4.        The benefits are assumed to be revenues from the sale of
electricity which is available due to the rehabilitation program. It is
assumed that without rehabilitation the output of the system would fall
from 2700 GWh in 1982 per year to 1500 GWh in 1994 at about 100 GWh
annually, and then remain constant at this value. 1982 was the year just
before the Inga-Shaba d.c. line was fully commissioned and the power plants
in Shaba had practically to supply all the dem-nd in the region. The power
transmitted through SIS is not firm and the Shaba power plants are
rehabilitated to provide firm power and energy for the region and to
GECAMINES. The average tariff in the Shaba region was calculated as
UScO.487/kWh.
5.        It was assumed that this rehabilitation project does not require
an increase in operating and maintenance costs.
6.        The streams of costs and revenues are presented in the table on
page 2 of this annex. The economic rate of return is estimated to be about
12 Z.
7.        Revised base costs and physical contingencies for the project are
as follow:
$ million

a/ By end-1986, it is expected that the first rehabilitated unit at Nseke
(installed capacity of the unit: 65MW; annual generation capability of
the unit: about 400 Gwh/a) and Nzilo (installed capacity of the unit:
27MW; annual generation capability of the unit: about 135 GWh/a) will
be recommissioned. Thus benefits of the rehabilitation begin to accrue
starting 1987.
