MALAWI
INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Malawi
Beneficiaries:     Investment and Development Bank of Malawi (INDEBANK),
National Bank of Malawi (NEM) and the Commercial Bank of
Malawi (CBM)
Terms:             Repayable in 15 years, including four years of grace,
with a variable rate of interest.
Amount:            US$7.8 miUlion equivalent
Relending Terms:   INDEBANK Line of Credit.  The Government would onlend
us$3.0 million to INDEBANK to finance industrial and
commercial projects at the variable interest rate
to be paid by Government on the proposed loan.
Repayment would be in accordance with the aggregate
amortization schedule applicable to the subloans. The
maximum repayment period is 15 years including 4 years
of grace. INDEBANK would on lend the funds at a
variable rate. INDEBANK's current lending rate for
industrial credit is 13 percent p.a. Sub-borrowers
would bear the exchange rate risk.
Agieultural Credit. The Government, through the
Reserve Bank of Malawi, would mnlend US$4.5 million to
INDEBANK, the National Bank of Malawi and the Commercial
Bank of Malawi at a rate initially set at 10.5% p.a.
These institutions would onlend at rates ranging from
11.5% to 15Z p.a. The Government would bear the
exchange rate and variable interest rate risks.
Technical Assistance Component. US$.3 million would be
a Government grant to INDEBANK.
Objectives
and Project
Description:       The project's objectives are to:  (i) improve the
efficiency and productivity of agricultural estates in
Mhlawi and encourage the gradual diversification into



(ii)
new crops; and (ii) builC upon and further strengthen
INDEBARK's institutional capabilities, assist in
diversification of its role in productive sectors, and
expand its activities in the agricultural sector-the
mainstay of Malawi's economy.  The proposed project
consists of: (1) a US$3.0 million credit line to
finance viable industrial, conmercial, transport and
tourism investments; (ii) a US$4.5 million agricultural
credit component to provide investment credit to
agricultural estates; and (iii) US$.3 million in
technical assistance to INDEBANK to strengthen its
capability to promote, appraise and monitor agricultural
projects.
Benefits
and Risks:          The proposed project would strengthen INDEBANK's
capability to more effectively promote the efficient
development of productive activities and thereby
creating new investment and employment opportunities in
Malawi. Benefits would accrue from the agricultural
component by: i) satisfying existing unfulfilled demand
for term financing for agricultural estates thus filling
a void in the financial sector; and (ii) financing
productivity improving investments which would free up
land and thereby increase potential for
diversification.  The pilot nature of this compoent-
partly to be channeled through the commercial banks-
would permit evaluation of the suitability of these
inrtitutions to effectively administer term credit to
the estate subsector.
The main project risk is that the estate crops are
produced for export and a substantial drop in the
international prices for these crops would result in
liquidity problems for sub-borrowers and in defaults on
loan repayments. Preliminary Bank forecasts indicate
some stability in these commodity prices. Further,
investments to be financed are expected to develop lower
cost producers better able to withstand price falls.
Gradual diversification would further reduce farmers'
vulnerability to this risk. Finally, participating
financial intermediaries' careful review procedures
would screen out marginal investments.

MALAWI
INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTUKLAL CREDIT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTUMAL BACKGROUND
A. The Manufacturing Sector
Background and Performance
1.01      The manufacturing sector in Malawi is still in its early stages
of development even though it accounted for 12.4Z of GDP in 1984, up from
57 two decades earlier. The rapid growth was accompanied by a substantial
Increase in employment (from 21,000 in i968 to 31,000 in 1964). However,
the sector's overall share of the total labor fnrce declined from
approximately 16Z in 19b8 to 9% in 1982 due to the faster growth of
employment in the estate agriculture subsector (from 311 of total
employment in 1968 to 501 in 1983). Performance of the manufacturing
sector over the past two decades was uneven. Between 1964 and 1975
Malawi's manufacturing output grew in real terms at an average annual rate
ranging between 11% and 13%, approximately twice the growth rate of the
national economy. The expansion of sugar production and the tea and
tobacco processing industries were the main contributors to the growth of
the sector. The domestic market was supplied to an increasingly larger
extent by new import substituting industries producing a wide ra'age of
goods including textiles, packaging materials, footwear, pharmaceuticals,
and wood and metal products.  Between 1976 and 1982 manufacturing output
growth slowed considerably to an annual average rate of only 3.3% in real
terms.  The diminished growth performance of the manufacturing sector was
in line with overall economic conditions in Malawi, particularly during the
1979 and 1980 period when the economy was characterized by sluggish growth,
rising public sector deficits, deteriorating financial conditions in
private and public enterprises, poor terms of trade and disequilibrium in
balance of payments. These problems were exacerbated by falling prices of
tobacco and tea, increases in import costs and the escalation of transport
costs due to difficulties encountered on the ieira and Nacala railway
lines.



- 2 -
1.02      Economic indicators show that, after several years of slow
growth, the economy of Malawi has begun to recover. In 1983 and 1984, the
economy grew by 4.5% and 6.8% respectively, and is estimated to grow by
3.3% in 1985. The manufacturing sector output grew in line with the
general economy in 1983 and 1984 and is estimated to either grow at the
same rate or better in 1985. The estimate is based on historical trends
and the Government's efforts to deal with outstanding problems.
Alternative routes through South Africa and Tanzania are being used to
resolve the transportation problems. Under the proposed third SAL
(scheduled to be negotiated in November 1985), the objective is to continue
implementation of policies designed to restructure the economy through
improved production incentives, export promotion and efficient import
substitution.
Structure
1.03      Manufacturing activity (which is predominantly owned and
controlled by public enterprises) is concentrated around Blantyre, the
commercial center of Malawi. The latest Annual Economic Survey shows that
there are 117 firms with annual turnover in excess of K 100,000 and ten or
more employees 1/. In addition, there are a large number of smaller firms
on which no statistical information is available. The sector is dominated
by the production of food and beverages, textiles and footwear for domestic
consumption, and tobacco, tea and sugar processing for export. Together,
these activities accounted for between 65% to 70Z of manufacturing output.
Manufacturing activity in Malawi is import-substitution oriented with the
exception of tobacco, tea and sugar processing. Fourteen large firms (all
within the three exporting subsectors), each with more than 500 employees
accounted for more than 51% of the total manufacturing employment.
Medium-size firms with between 50 and 100 employees accounted for 7% of
sector employment while smaller firms (less than 50 employees) accounted
for less than 3%. These small-scale firms are usually engaged in
activities where economies of scale are not large (typically bakeries,
clothing, furniture, paper products, etc.).
1.04      The relationship of value added to sales in 1979 was
approximately one third on a sector-wide basis (excluding tea and tobacco
the bulk of whose value added is derived in the agricultural sector).
Variance across subsectors was fairly limited, thei extreme cases being
beverages wSth value added at 43% of sales and chemicals at 18% at the
lower end. The manufacturing sector in Malawi is characterized by a low
level of capital intensity with average fixed assets per worker of K 2,900
(K 3,600 excluding tea and tobacco processing which tend to be more labor
intensive). The level of capital intensity is in line with the
Government's objective of generating employment and consistent with
Malawi's level of economic development and low factor endowment. Given the
pre-eminence of large firms, the Government of Malawi has adopted a policy
of promoting the development of small-scale enterprises.
1f A large-scale firm in Malawi is defined as a company whose value added
exceeds K iO0,000 per year. Medium-size firms have an annual value
added range of K 10,000 - K 100,000.



-3-
Institutional and Policy Framework
1.05      Several Government Ministries and institutions, parastatal and
semi-private organizations influence the formulation and implementation of
policy in the manufacturing sector in Malawi. The Government institutions
directly involved in the industrial sector are the Malawi Export Promotion
Council (MPC) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism (MTIT). The
parastatals and semi-private organizations were formed after Malawi
attained independence to facilitate the attainment of the Government's
objective of faster economic growth and the development of a strong
indigenous private sector in Malawi, particularly in the more specialized
areas where there was a severe shortage of local skilled labor, and
entrepreneurial and managerial talent. Most prominent in this set of
companies are the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation
(ADMARC), Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) and the Press Group Limited
(PGL). These three conglomerates contributed more than 70% of the
manufacturing sector's value added and more than 40% of GDP in 1979.
1.06      The Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) is a Goverament-owned
statutory body set up in 1964 to promote projects, including joint venture
undertakings with foreign investors, in activities that are in line with
the country's development strategy. MDC does not promote investments in
the agricultural sector or in small scale industries. After a troubled
period in the early 1980s, MDC's portfolio has recently undergone a major
reorganization that has resulted in a reduction of the number of
subsidiaries and associated companies from 32 to 21 through mergers,
divestitures and new management. As a result of the recent changes, MDC is
once again in a position to pursue its primary role of catalyzing
investments in new projects and generating funds for new industrial project
development. After making losses in both 1983 and 1984, the company is
expected to make a modest profit in 1985.
1.07      The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC)
is another statutory body set up in 1971 under the Ministry of Agriculture
with the objective of promoting the development of Malawi 's agricultural
exports (other than estate crops), providing an efficient inputs supply and
marketing system for the products of small farmers, and developing
agro-industrial enterprises. ADMARC has a network of 1,090 outlets
throughout the country. The Goverament of Malawi's Structural Adjustment
Program included an analysis of the financial and operating efficiency of
ADMARC. On the basis of this analysis, the Government adopted an action
program to strengthen ADMARC which included: (a) improving ADMARC's
pricing policies; (b) reducing marketing costs by cutting back the number
of outlets; (c) restructuring ADMARC's portfolio by limiting investments to
activities directly related to the marketing or processing functions; (d)
establishing a planning unit; (e) strengthening financial management; (f)
improving crop marketing and distribution by increasing the role of the
informal sector; and (g) improving training and manpower development.  The
action program has not been fully implemented. ADMARC is still facing
serious financial difficulties due largely to its statutory responsibility
to purchase maize from smallholder farmers at a price which is higher than



- 4 -
the market clearing price, the loss of export markets for that maize, and
the subsequent necessity to store excess grain at great cost. The Bank is
working with the Government and ADKARC on ways to deal with these issues
and on measures to strengthen ADMARC's operational efficiency within the
context of a policy-based loan to Malawi currently under preparation.
1.08      The Press Group Limited (PGL) (created in 1960 initially as a
publishing company) is a highly diversified holding company, that operates
across most economic sectors in Malawi. The company has 12 wholly-owned
subsidiaries and 17 associated companies. Although PGL is a private
enterprise, its operations are so large that they have a profound impact on
the country's economic life. Until 1979, PGL had been consistently
profitable, but thereafter, the group's financial position deteriorated
rapidly. A major component of Malawi's Structural Adjustment Program
consisted of the design and execution of an action program to restore the
financial viability of PGL. Based on the recommendations of consultants,
PGL's debts were rescheduled, a new management team was appointed and the
portfolio restructured through mergers and acquisitions. Although the
streamlining has not been completed yet, substantial progress has been
made. For the nine-month fiscal year ended on September 1984, only two
group companies flere still making losses. Six companies are still up for
divestment.
Industrial Policies
1.09      The Government's strategy in the industrial sector is to
encourage a continued expansion in manufacturing activity based on Malawi's
agricultural, forestry and livestock resources.  The Government's sectoral
policies are sound and consistent with its long-term strategy in the
sector. Below is a summary of current Government policies that have a
direct bearing on the industrial sector.
1.10      The industrial licensing policy seeks to foster the development
of a strong private sector in the country. Prospective investors are
required to obtain a license from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and
Tourism (MTIT). All applications for industrial licenses are usually
granted, unless the enterprise is not consistent with Malawi's sectoral
strategy or is against Malawi's national interest. In cases where an
industry needs special protection, the MTIT can extend exclusive licenses
renewable every five years, although this provision has been used sparsely
in the recent past.
1.11      Foreign investments are encouraged in all sectors except for
public utilities, most retailing, and internal transportation which are
restricted to the public sector or Malawian citizens. Malawian public or
private sector participation either minority or majority--in foreign
investments is strongly encouraged but not mandatory. Dividends and other
forms of profits, as well as capital on divestment, are remittable subject
to compliance with exchange control regulations. There are no differential
incentives for foreign investors, but all incentives available to local
investors are also available to foreign investors. No tax holidays exist
in Malawi, except for contractors engaged in internationally tunded
projects, which may be exempted from taxation on the profits of a
particular contract. Fiscal incentives take the form of allowances for
accelerated depreciation of virtually all tangible assets, special
depreciation allowances of up to 10% of expenditures on industrial



buildings, and write offs for expenditures incurred before and during
start-up (up to 18 months). Accelerated depreeiation provisions are
generous: first year depreciation deductions, excluding the 10 special
deduction, total 152 in the case of buildings, and 53Z in the case of
certain machinery. There is no limit to the period of time over which tax
losses can be built up or utilized, and in most cases they can be offset
against the taxpayer's other income taxable in Malawi.
1.12      Import Tariffs.  Malawi operates under a two-tier import tariff.
All associates of the Lome Convention and the Southern African Development
Conference (SADDC) qualify for most favored nation treatment, and most
imports fall into this category and attract tariff discounts. Higher
tariffs (which are similar to those in other SADDC and PTA member
countries) are charged on the import of products that are manufactured
locally. Excise duty is payable on imports at the same rates applied to
locally produced products (tobacco, alcoholic and other beverages, soap,
cane sugar, and woven fabrics). A temporary import levy of 5% is payable
on all imports. All imports are subject to some form of import licensing
in Malawi. Nevertheless, the import licensing system is administered very
flexibly by the MTIT and license applications are seldom, if ever,
rejected. Restricted imports are principally firearms and explosives, and
banned films and publications.
1.13      Exchange Rate Policy.  The Malawi Kwacha is tied to a basket of
currencies. Malawi makes frequent currency adjustments In order to realign
the Kwacha with the basket for the differential between domestic and world
inflation. The last adjustment took place in April 1985 after one year of
nominal exchange rate stability, and implied a decrease of 152 in the value
of the Kwacha. The Government is committed to maintaining a flexible
exchange rate policy, that seeks to maintain the Rwacha's real value.
Development Constraints and Issues
1.14      The Structural Adjustment Program (para. 1.18). being undertaken
by the Government of Malawi includes actions designed to deal with the
issues highlighted below, more as a matter of fine tuning rather than major
po'icy reforms.
(a) Price Controls: The Government of Malawi trlhtains a system of
formal and informal price controls on a variety of items that are
considered essential either as consumer products or production inputs. The
system of formal and informal price controls that evolved duaing the 1970s
reached a level that was seriously hampering the industrial sector. By the
early 1980s, with increased inflationary pressures, the system was creating
serious disincentives for producers, by failing to signal shortages and
surpluses, causing cost Inefficiencies and imposing a financial burden on
those firms experiencing large increases in their input prices. Under SAL
1I, the Government, in implementing its price liberalization program,
reduced the number of items on the price control list from 56 in December
1983 to 9 in August 1985. The Government is committed to carry out the
price liberalization program to its conclusion.



- 6 -
(b) Foreign Exchange Allocations by the Reserve Bank of Malawi: The
Government of tla1awi pursues, through the MTIT, a flexible system of
foreign exchange allocation. In the early 1980s, the system came under
considerable pressure due to the adverse economic conditions that Malawi
was then experiencing. This led the Reserve Bank to try to reduce imports
through delays of foreiga exchange allocations.   The system also led to
foreign exchange allocations being concentrated mostly in the established
traders, and discouraged the development of new, presumably indigenous,
entrepreneurship. As part of the SAL III program, the Government intends
to pursue an active exchange rate management policy which virtually
eliminate the need for a formal allocation system. Also, it will actively
facilitate importation of products which compete with domestically produced
goods to encourage production efficiency.
(c) Export Incentives: Although there are no specific export
incentives in Malawi, a duty drawback system allows exporters to claim the
duties paid on imported inputs used in production of goods for export. The
system has however been ineffective due to the bureaucracy Involved In the
rebate procedures, and many exporters elect not to collect this benefit.
Under SAL III, the Government will take specific measures to stimulate
exports in general, and non-traditional exports In particular.
Institutional strengthening, with external technical assistance, will form
part of the overall export promotion policy package.
(d) There are two types of tariff rebates in Malawi: general and
special. Under the general system, local manufacturers may apply for
rebates of duties on imports of parts and materials used in manufacturing
activities. Since actual rebates vary from item to item, the reault may be
a reduced duty or zero duty. Decisions are made on an ad-hoc basis. Under
the special rebate system, tariffs can be reduced to 10% or 5Z for goods
needed for the establishment, development, or operation of any industrial
undertaking considered of national importance. The duty drawback scheme
will form part of the export promotion policy package.
Manufacturing Sector Prospects
1.15      The economy of Malawi is projected to grow in real terms at an
average annual rate of 3.7% during the 1985-89 period. The manufacturing
sector is likewise .xpected to grow at an average of 4.0% annually, with
growth in exports &,eraging 4.9%. Industry is expected to play an
increasingly larger role as the impetus of growth and employment because of
the limited agricultural land frontier in Malawi. These projections are
predicated upon the successful implementation of the Structural Adjustment
Program and stable trends in the intermational economic environment. The
Government is taking measures aimed at a more diversified production and
export growth in order to sustain a steady and positive per capita income
growth. Manufacturing sector growth will also depend on the speed with
which the Government tackles the various problems noted above that
constrain expansion.
Bank Group Experience and Strategy in the Sector
1.16      The Bank has had only one DFC operation in Malawi (a ;S$3 million
loan to INDEBANK in 1979; less than 1% of total Bank/IDA assistan-a of



-7-
US$340 million). IFC, however, has had five operations-a US$0.6 million
equity participation in INDEBANK, and investments in a textile mill
(USM10.8 million), a sugar mill (US$9.9 million), hotels (US$2.0 million)
and ethanol production (US$2.5 million), totalling US25.8 million.
1.17      The Bank's strategy in the industrial sector in Malawi is to
encourage and assist continued manufacturing expansion in Malawi. The
prospects for such expansion are good, and several promising
agro-industrial projects, with considerable export potential, have been
identified with the assistance of a Bank-funded study. The bank's main
lending in the sector in the medium-term will be to INDEBANK because of its
position as the main local source of long-term finance for enterprises in
the sector. INDEBANK seeks to increase its involvement in projects with
high priority and of importance to national development. The Bank Group
will continue to support INDEBANK's investments in agriculture,
agro-processing, industry, transpo-t, tourism and other productive
activities. The Bank also proposes to provide continued help to strengthen
the project promotion and appraisal functions of INDEBANK.
1.18      Elsewhere in the sector, the bank recently approved a loan of
US$6.4 million for a Wood Industries Restructuring Project to Improve wood
processing and privacize forest industries in Malawi. Other improvements
in the sector are being sought by the Bank through the reform of incomes,
prices and incentive policies and the diversification of exports, and are
being addressed in the context of the continuing structural lending
operations in Malawi. As part of the ongoing Structural Adjustment Program
in Malawi, the Government has undertaken to review and improve the overall
industrial policy environment. As noted earlier (para. 1.14), areas that
are being focused on include price controls, industrial licensing, foreign
exchange allocation and the exchange rate policy, and export promotion.
B. The Agricultural Estate Subsector
Background
1.19      The agricultural sector in Malawi is structurally dualistic;
smallholder farming on customary (tribal) land and estate farming on
leasehold (or freehold) land. Smallholder production is predominantly
subsistance farming but may include some commercial farms on tribal land.
Estate production ranges from large scale integrated sugar
production/processing to small tobacco estates cultivating less than one
hectare of tobacco. There are also two intermediate systems, one involving
smallholder outgrowers of sugar cane who seU their produce to the estate
for processing and the other involving tenant farmers who work on leasehold
land to produce burley tobacco. In addition to the tenurial system, other
characteristics which separate the smallholder subsector from the estate
subsector are: crops that can (or cannot) be legally produced, the access



- 8 -
to subsidized inputs and market outlets, sources of credit and extension
services. The smallholder subsector accounts for about 80% of total
agricultural production and mainly produces maize, sorghum, pulses,
cassava, groundnuts, rice, cotton and oriental, fire-cured and sun/air
cured tobaccos. The main crops produced by the estate subsector are tea,
sugar, flue-cured and burley tobacco-production of these tobacco types
being restricted to this subsector. In 1984, out of Malawi's total land
area of about 9.5 million hectares only some 4X was held under estate
subsector and the area devoted to estate production was less than 10X of
land suitable for cultivation. Nevertheless, the estate subsector accounts
for about 80% of the country's foreign exchange earnings with exports of
tobacco, sugar, tea, coffee and macadamia nuts.
1.20      Within the estate subsector, farm size, management and technical
capability vary considerably. Older and larger estates are generally
managed by capable staff who are knowledgeable about managerial as well as
agronomic aspects of crop production. On the other hand, the
owners/managers of smaller/medium size and new estates generally lack the
management and technical know-how to facilitate optimm land use and crop
production. Overall the estate subsector has shown a growth pattern as the
production of all of the major crops increased between 1972 and 1982.
During this period, the sales of flue-cured and burley tobaccos increased
at an annual rate of 10% and 17% respectively. Increased tobacco
production and trade was facilitated by the trade embargo placed on
Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) as a result of Unilateral Declaration of Independence
(UDI). Within the estate subsector there have been significant shifts in
Production. Increases in flue-cured tobacco production have not kept pace
with increases in burley tobacco production for a number of reasons
principally fuelwood shortages, increased cost of production and lack of
term credit. The production of tea and sugar showed a similar growth
pattern with annual average growth rates of 6% and 18% respectively.
1.21      In the past, the development of the estate subsector had been
left to the private sector, with very little Government direction or
assistance. In the medium-term, the prospects for the traditional estate
crops are somewhat limited, because of a weak world demand for tobacco and
sugar, uncertainty over future world prices and steady increases in local
input costs. Therefore, there is a priority need to diversify away from
traditional crops in order to augment growth in exports and stabilize
earnings. This would require a more active Government role to assist in
meeting the subsector's critical needs, particularly for term credit and
technical assistance. The estates, in conjunction with the Government,
will need to develop a feasible future strategy for diversification and
growth. The following activities could form the principal elements of a
diversification strategy: (a) an increase in the productivity of tobacco
estates through improved management, better cropping patterns and increased
efficiency of input use particularly in tobacco curing; (b) a move to the
production of higher value import substitution crops (e.g. wheat) or to
crops with significant local value added (e.g. cotton and vegetable oil);
(c) increased utilization of cultivable land througn better crop rotation,
irrigation and soil conservation; and (d) expansion of cultivation of
existing plantation crops such as coffee, rubber and macademia and cashew
nuts.

Estate Subsector Services
1.22      The Tea Research Foundation (TRF) and the Tobacco Research
Authoa.ty (TRA) conduct agricultural research for the estate subsector.
Both tet and tobacco research are funded through producer levies derived
from their specific crops. TRF and TRA undertake basic research work
exclusivel, on tea and tobacco crops, while TRA also provides, within its
restricted budget, limited extension services. The Agricultural
Departments of the commercial banks have a cadre of technical staff who
monitor, and in some cases manage tobacco estates and thereby provide
extension services to part of the estate subsector. The Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) extensiom service is focussed exclusively upon the
smallholder subsector.
1.23      The Government has been preparing an assistance program for the
estate subsector. The two elements of this program are (i) the
establishment of an extension and management training service to help to
upgrade the performance particularly of small- and medium-sized estates,
and (ii) provision of institutional credit to finance development
investments. In regard to extension and management training, after an
effort to organize a private sector facility did not prove to be fruitful,
the Government has now agreed to the establishment of an autonomous
authority for this purpose. As proposed, the new institution would be
initially supported by external funding, but would be expected to become
self-supporting over time through financial contributions from the
estates. ODA of the UK expressed interest in providing initial finance to
the proposed institution, and intends to evaluate, in the near future, a
scheme for the institution based on an analysis by the Bank of the needs cf
the estates for extension assistance and training. The new institution,
would be an element of the forthcoming third structural adjustment lending
operation for Malawi and is expected to be established during 1986. The
Bank and the Government of Malawi will review progress in the establishment
of this institution during implementation of the SAL.
1.24      There is no specialized agricultural credit institution in
Malawi. Smallholder farmers have access to seasonal and medium-term credit
through the Ministry of Agriculture's rural development projects which have
their own credit funds and credit staff. The main source of credit to the
estate subsector are the two commercial banks operating in the country.
Historically, neither the tea estates (mostly owned by overseas investors)
nor the two sugar estates (jointly owned by the Government and overseas
investors) have relied significantly on local borrowings except for trade
finance. Instead, capital investments have largely been funded from
corporate sources and offshore loans. On the other hand, National Bank of
Malawi (para. 2.01) and Commercial Bank of Malawi (para. 2.03) have been
virtually the only source of credit for tobacco estates. Recently,
INDEBANK, INDEFUND and SEDOM have provided credit for agro-industries.
1.25      During the boom period in estate development, the two commercial
banks were encouraged by the Malawi Government to provide credit to tobacco
estates mainly for seasonal but also for some medium-term requirements.
Despite the banks' initial ladck of expertise in this type of lending and
their meagre medium-term financial resources, total loans to tobacco



- 10 -
estates went up from about K 9 million (US$10.4 million) in 1975 to about K
90 million (US$110.8 million) in 1980. Most of these loans including
capital investment financing, were characterized by low borrower
contribution and short repayment periods. These characteristics, combined
with the increased input costs, poor yields and falling international
prices created liquidity problems for many of the borrowers resulting in
high rate of defaults. A number of loans were foreclosed and some estates
went into receivership with the commercial banks taking over management.
Although the commercial banks suffered substantial losses, they have since
recovered and almost all the bad loans have been written off. In recent
years the commercial banks have concentrated on seasonal loans mainly
because of lack of medium-term funds to finance investment loans, although
they have over the years developed and maintained sufficient expertise to
increase their involvement in term financing.  Commercial Banks' reluctance
to provide term financing has created a considerable backlog for investment
credit. A survey of potential credit demand carried out in February 1965
by a consultant engaged for this purpose indicated that over a five-year
period estates would require about K 17 million (US$9.4 million) to achieve
and maintain optimum production.
1.2b       To meet the subsector's medium- and long-term credit needs, the
Government had originally intended to establish a new institution. A
feasibility study for the establishment of such an institution to be called
AGRIBANK was carried out by consultants financed under the technical
assistance componenr of SAL II. However, during appraisal it was concluded
that because of the high cost of establishment use of existing financial
institutions, particularly the commercial banks with their strong
agricultural staff, would be less costly than establishing a new
institution. Implementation of the proposed agricultural credit component
under the project, which would be of pilot nature, would aim at fostering
improved productivity in the estate subsector. The credit scheme would
also help in determining the relative strengths/weaknesses of the existing
institutional framework in efrectively handling term credit to the
estates. It is expected that the pilot scheme would provide the basis for
evaluating future term credit needs.
Agricultural Development Strategy and Constraints
1.27      The Government is trying to provide a growth climate for both
smallholder and estate production in support of its overall strategy of
maintaining self-sufficiency in food staples with expansion in export and
import substitution crops and improvement in rural incomes. In the past
few years there has been a gradual shift within the smallholder subsector
into maize monocropping away from traditional and more diversified cropping
systems involving substantial areas of tobacco, groundnuts, beans and
cotton. As a part of this process, which was put into motion because of
concerns about food self-sufficiency, the Government introduced special
price incentives for maize. These actions have produced a disequilibrium
between maize and other crops. The Government is now trying to redress
th-is problem through better price incentives for non-maize crops, support
for problem-oriented adaptive research programs, improved input delivery
and supply of better technical support for the extension service. Under
the ongoing structural adjustment process, the methodology for determining



- 11 -
smallholder inputs and producer prices has been developed and these prices
are reviewed with the Bank annually.
1.28      In recent years there has been an increasing realization that
Malawi's future economic growth is greatly dependent on the optimization of
land use and diversification into high value export and impor: substitution
crops. Agricultural development is constrained by a series of land issues
which have constrained production, including: (i) leasing policy and
rental rates; (ii) legal requirements that the production of some crops be
tenure specific; and (iii) land transfers. Tnese are the sbbject of an
ongoing World Bank study.
1.29      The proposed pilot agricultural credit component, which would be
the Bank Group's first operation in the estate subsector, will seek to
improve agricultural estates productivity thus freeing land for
diversification. The Bank's agricultural strategy in Malawi aims at
facilitating key policy and institutional reforms conducive to investment
and growth. The Bank has been working with the Government to formulate
strategies and programs for improved agricultural growth in the country.
The Bank's lending strategy emphasizes investment in agricultural services
(research and extension) and agricultural credit to increase production and
productivity in the sector. In addition to the proposed project, the Bank
has identified a number 3f priority investments to help achieve the above
objectives. These include an Agricultural Research Project, an
Agricultural Extension aad Planning Support Project, and a Second Wood
Energy Project. The proposed project would, therefore, complement ongoing
and planned activities in the agricultural sector.
C. The Financial Sector
1.30      The financial sector of Malawi is made up of 12 institutions that
of'er a wide range of financial services which include commercial banking,
development banking, specialized lending to medium- and small-scale
enterprises, mortgage lending and trade financing, as well as venture
capital. There is no stock market in Malawi.
Financial Institutions
1.31      The Reserve Bank of Malawi.  The Reserve Bank playF the customary
role of a central bank; it regulates commercial banks and alr.inisters
national monetary and credit policies through the use of the discount rate,
reserve requirements and direct controls such as setting minimum and
maximum interest rates, for both deposits and loans by commercial banks.
The Reserve Bank can lend to any statutory body, subject to the prior
authorization of the Ministry of Finance. The Reserve Bank also manages
Malawi's international reserves and is in charge of the country's foreign
exchange control system which it administers in cooperation with the
commercial banks.



- 12 -
1.32      The two commercial banks--NBM and CBM--were started as joint
ventures between local and foreign interests. The participation of foreign
interests has declined over the years and with t;ie exception of a 20%
foreign interest in the National Bank of Malawi, the commercial banks are
now owned by the Government of Malawi and the three major holding
companies-the Press Group, ADMARC and MDC. Tne commercial banks account
for the bulk of domestic credit and domestic resource mobilization, mainly
through demand or short-term deposits and lending for equally short
periods, primarily to agriculture. As of December 31, 1984, the total
assets of the two commercial banks amounted to K 403 million (US$303
million). Details on the commercial banks' role, operations and financial
condition are described in detail in paras. 2.01 to 2.06.
1.33      The Postal Savings Bank (POSB) was established in 1911 with the
objective of promoting savings, especially among the lower income groups or
those living in rural areas. POSB conducts its operations through a
network of 119 post offices, 126 postal agencies, and 12 market agencies;
it holds 524,000 savings accounts for a total of K 41.4 million (US$23
million). Savers are paid an interest of 10.75Z p.a. free of incorme tax.
All of POSB's resources are invested in Government bonds.
1.34      The New Building Society (NBS) is the main institution that
provides mortgage financing for commercial and residential purposes. It is
owned 51% by the Government of Malawi and the remaining 49Z is split
equally between two foreign-owned companies--Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd and Protea
Assurance Company Ltd. of South Africa. NBS competes directly with the
POSB in attracting accounts from small dejositors.  As at the end of
December 1984, NBS's total assets amounted to K 19.2 million (US$14.4
million); approximately 55% of these were mortgages, and some 20% were
temporarily held in Reserve Bank stock as a result of excessive liquidity
provoked by stagnating housing sales at the upper income levels.
1.35      The Small Enterprise Organization of Malawi (SEDOM) is a
statutory bod*' specializing in lending and providing technical assistance
to small-scale Malawian industries. Established in 1982, SEDOM had as of
March 31, 1985, approved 326 loans totalling K 1.2 million (US$0.7
million). It charges an interest rate of 16% p.a. on its loans whose
maturities range from two and one half to six years, depending on the
nature of the project. SEDOM also provides working capital loans. SEDOM's
technical assistance focusses on entrepreneurship training and record
keeping. The Government of Malawi and the European Economic Community
(EEC) financed the first stage in the development of SEDOM and the EEC is
considering a new contribution of K 6.5 million (US$3.6 million) over the
next two years.
1.36      Two insurance companies--the National Insurance Company (NICO)
and the Old Mutual--provide a variety of insurance services.  NICO is cwned
by the Government of Malawi and the Guardian Insurance Company of the
United Kingdom; and the Old Mutual is owned by a foreign insurance group of
the same name. As of December 31, 1983, the combined assets of the two
companies amounted to K 62 million (US$49.6 million)--equivalent to 17% of
the total assets of the commercial banks. About 50% of these assets
represented investments in the private sector, in the form of loans against
policies, 30% were in bank deposits and the rest were invested in
Government bonds.



- 13 -
1.37      In addition to the institutions discussed above, there are two
development financial institutions-INUISBANK and its subsidiary INDEFUMD
which provide medium- and long-term financing to projects in the productive
sectors. These institutions are discussed in detail in paras. 2.47 through
2.50.
Credit Allocation
1.38      Net domestic credit increased from K 24 million (US$27.6 million)
in 1970 to K 544 million (US$409 million) in 1984, equivalent to a nominal
annual growth rate of nearly 25X--well above the inflation rate during the
period, and resulting in a growing credit to GDP ratio. Credit to the
public sector grew much faster than credit to the private sector; from
uegative net values in 1970, it eventually begun to exceed credit to the
private sector in the mid-1970s and by 1984, it represented 60X of total
credit. Credit to the private sector, however, managed to keep pace with
the needs of an expanding economy: in 1984, the ratio of credit to the
private sector to GDP stood at 13%, compared to 9X in 1974. The sectoral
distribution of commercial banks' advances underwent some changes over the
last decade, in line with the country's agriculture-based development
strategy. While the share of loans going to agriculture increased, from
.-out 20% in 1973 to 48% in 1983, that going to wholesale and retail trade
diminished, from 45% to IIZ. Except for the lack of medium- and long-term
credit to agricultural sector, the current credit system has met the credit
needs in the country adequately.
Inflation and Interest Rates
1.39      From the mid-1970s to 1982, the rate of inflation in Malawi
averaged about 10% p.a. During the last three years, inflation accelerated
somewhat to about 12X p.a. due to the increase in domestic borrowings by
the Government to cover growing budgetary deficits, wage adjustments and
increases in import prices.  It is anticipated that inflation will decline
to 11% in 1986, 10% in 1987 and 9Y in 1988-
1.40      Interest rates in Malawi are regulated by the Reserve Bank of
Malawi. The Reserve Bank's overall interest rate policy is to maintain
interest rates at levels conducive to the growth of savings while fostering
the efficient use of investment resources. Accordingly, interest rates
have been revised fairly regularly over the past five years to take into
account trends in the rate of inflation, to regulate credit and to assure
adequate margins for the financia. intermediaries. The Reserve Bank
discount rate was increased from 8% to 10% in 1980 and more recently, to
11X. Deposit rates have been recently increased to a minimum of 11.75% for
demand deposits and to a minimm of 12.25% for time deposit.  Commercial
bank lending rates currently range from a minimum of 11.51 p.a. on loans to
the agricultural sector to a maximum of 19% p.a. for loans to other
sectors. Minimum rates charged by the New Building Society vary from
13.75Z for residential housing mortgages to 17.75Z p.a. on mortgages for
commercial properties. The structure of current interest rates is
presented in Annex 1. The current interest rates are in line with
Government's obiectives and are generally adequate.

II. THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
A. The National Bank of Malawi (NBM)
2.01      Ownership, Organization and Management:  NBH  was founded in 1971
by merging the operations of the Standard Bank and Barclays Bank (both of
whicb were fully foreign-owned). At that time, the Government of Malawi,
through ADMARC, acquired a majority shareholding. In 1982, Barclays Bank
sold its shares to the Standard Chartered Bank. At present Press
Corporation and ADMARC own 47% and 33Z of shares respectively and the
Standard Chartered Bank 20%. NBM has a Board of Directors consisting of
six members including the Chairman.  The NBM organization consists of the
head office in Blantyre, 14 branches and 66 agencies throughout the
country. Top management of the Bank is provided by the Standard Chartered
Bank through seconded expatriate staff. Managers of the operating and
financial department at head office and branr h Managers of the Southern
Region report directly to NBM's Chief Executive. The responsibility for
the Northern and Central Regions, as well as the Agricultural Advisory
Unit, is entrusted to an Area Maaager located in Lilongwe. NBM's
organization chart structure (Annex 2) is appropriate.
2.02      Portfolio and Financial Performance:  Ever since its
incorporation, National Bank has been the dominant commercial bank in
Malawi.  Its financial resources and volume of operations are about three
times as large as those of tne Commercial Bank of Malawi.  Between 1981 and
1984, NBM's customers' deposits increased by 60% to K 244 million (US$207
million). Similarly, its loan portfolio, after making provision for
doubtful debts, increased by 19% to K 126 million (US$107.2 million).
NKM follows very conservative and sound financial policies in as much as it
adequately provides for all bad and doubtful debts. Following this policy
in recent years, NBM has set aside nearly 100l of the amount of bad debts
relating to the tobacco loans given by the bank in the late 1970s (para.
2.06). Despite making such large provisions and the fact that the Reserve
Bank increased interest rates on customers' deposits in 1983 without a
corresponding increase in interest on bank loans until this year, NBM has
remained profitable. NBM's summarized balance sheets and income statements
are presented in the Basic Data. Since all the old bad debts have nearly
been provided for, NBM is expected to increase its net profit in future
years.
B. The Commercial Bank of Malawi (CBM)
2.03      Ownership, Organization and Management:  CBM was incorporated in
1969, as a joint venture between local and foreign interests. Following



- 15 -
the sale of Bank of America's 30% share in 1983, CBM is now owned 40% by
the Press Group and 30% each by the Government of Malawi and MDC. CBM's
Board of Directors consists of seven members.  CBM's organization comprises
of the head office in Blantyre, 13 branches and over 80 agencies spread all
over the country. Heads of the Advances, Legal, Administration, Personnel
and Training Departments at head office report directly to CBM's General
Manager. Staff in the Agricultural Department, as well as branch and
agency managers, report to the Administration Manager at head office.
CBM's organization is presented in Annex 3.
2.04      Portfolio and Financial Performance:  Although CBM maintains as
large a branch network as NBM, its operations in financial terms are iuch
smaller. As of June 30, 1985, CBM's total assets amounted to K 150 million
(US$83.3 million) of which K 63 million (US$35 million) were in the form of
advances to the private sector, and K 32 million (US$17.8 million)
represented investments, mostly in local registered stock. Total deposits
amounted to K 87 million (US$48.3 million) a large proportion of which came
from large depositors. CBM has been striving to improve its liquidity
position, but is still somewhat below the 30Z statutory limit. CBM's
profitability which for some time has been marginal improved significantly
in fiscal year 1985.
The Commercial Banks' Operations, Policies and Procedures
2.05      Operations and Lending Policies:  The operations of the two
commercial banks are similar in many respects.  Both banks are involved in
financing the main sectors of the economy: agriculture, industry,
construction, transportation and trade, primarily providing working capital
financing. They actively compete for customers' deposits which are the
main source of their financial resources. Their branches are located in
densely populated areas to ensure sufficient volume of business and viable
operations. Banking service to relatively less populated areas is provided
through a network of static and mobile agencies.
2.06      Both banks have been generally run as moderately conservative
banking institutions. In the late 1970s, under Government pressure, the
banks embarked on a program of rapidly increasing their lending to
agriculture, particularly to tobacco estates. During the 1975-80 period,
the banks' tobacco loans increased tenfold and in 1980 represented some 51X
of their total advances compared with 15% in 1975. A large number of these
loans were given to new estates which were formed as a part of the
Goverament's strategy to expand tobacco production to take advantage of the
trade embargo imposed on Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Since most of othe new
borrowers lacked technical and management capability to ensure optimum
yields, they were unable to withstand the effects of falling international
tobacco prices. A number of estates went into receivership and were taken
over by the banks (para. 1.25). Since then, both banks have rerouped a
part of their losses by selling some of the farms, by subleasing some
estates and by operating a -few estates themselves profitably. However, a
substantial portion of these loans had to be written off.



- 16 -
2.07      Until the late 1970s, both commercial banks employed minimal
agricultural staff as the technical and financial management of the
agricultural estates of their clients were considered to be the
responsibility of the borrowers. However, with the rapid increase in the
banks' lending to the estate subsector and the poor performance of the
borrowers, the commercial banks have made some important changes: they are
now pursuing a more prudent lending polic-y towards agriculture.
Specifically, they have restricted their seasonal lending mainly to
activities that demonstrate strong viability and have imposed greater
financial controls on their clients. The banks encourage borrowers to
produce alternative crops (other than flue-cured tobacco) and assist them
in adopting sound agricultural, conservation and management practices. To
enable them to play this role, the banks have recruited additional staff to
provide technical and financial management support to their borrowers.
These measures have resulted in a substantial drop in tobacco loans from a
peak of about K 100 million (US$94.7 million) in outstanding loans to about
500 estates in 1982 to about K 60 million (US$33.3 million) to less than
300 estates at present.
2.08      Interest Rates:  The commercial banks charge interest rates
ranging from 11.5Z to 15S on agricultural loans. Within this range, the
interest rate charged depend, among other things, on the cost of funds, the
purpose for which the loans are intended and the possible risk on the
loans. The average interest rate on agricultural loans is expected to be
around 13 1% p.a. The rates charged have so far enabled the commercial
banks to cover their costs and earn a sufficient profit margin. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to annually review and revise interest
rates to ensure that the rates charged by INDEBANK and the comuercial banks
on their agricultural loans are (i) positive in real terms; (ii) in line
with the overall interest rate structure in the country; (iii) adequate to
enable the institutions to cover their reasonable administrative expenses,
provide for possible losses on their loans and earn adequate profit
margins; and (iv) adequate to permit the attainment of the objectives of
the project.
2.09      Appraisal and Supervision Procedures:  Loan applications are
normally proce-sed in the branches where customers have their accounts.
Since most of the applicants have regular and frequent dealings with a
particular branch office, the manager and/or other officials have a
thorough and intimate knowledge of the client's business operations.
Applicants are required to submit feasibility studies of the investment
proposals, financial statements for the past three years, five-year
financial projections and details on management of the borrowing entity.
After a preliminary analysis at the branch office, applications, together
with the managers recommendations, are forwarded to the head office for
further review. This procedure is necessary since the loan amounts applied
for usually exceed the limit that can be approved by branch managers. The
applications and other relevant information are taoroughly analyzed by the
banks' Advances Department to establish the accuracy of information
provided and the viability of the proposed projects. Qualified loan
applications are submitted for approval to the banks' Chief Executives who
have the authority to approve loans up to certain amounts. Applications in
excess of these amounts require approval of the Boards of Directors. The
banks' appraisal procedures are satisfactory. During negotiations it was



- 17 -
agreed that NBM and CBM will calculate financial rates of return for all
projects requiring finaneing under the component of more than K 180,000
(US$100,000). In order to ensure continued adequacy of the appraisal
standards of NBM and CBM, and to help to build up INDEBANK's capability to
appraise agricultural projects (para. 2.25), the Bank will review from time
to time, agricultural subproject appraisal reports prepared by these
institutions. Agreement was reached at negotiations that at the Bank's
request, each participating bank would submit an agreed number of such
appraisal reports, selected at random by the Bank. The participating banks
would make the requisite improvements or adjustments In their appraisal
methodology and practices based on the Bank's comments.
2.10      Both NBM and CBK have units responsible for supervising loans in
their portfolio. Supervision activities, which are carried by designated
staff in the banks' branches, are coordinated by head office staff. The
majority of investments financed by the banks, particularly agricultural
projects are supervised regularly. The banks' staff visit the clients
regularly, review their operations and provide technical, financial and
overall management advice. The management of the banks are kept advised of
the performance of each borrower through supervision reports prepared at
least once a month. The reports comment on the utilization of loan
proceeds, compare actual operations with projections made at appraisal,
review the effect'veness of the management of the borrowing enterprise, its
financial condition and recommend measures for dealing with any problems in
these areas. The commercial banks' supervision procedures and practices
are satisfactory. The commercial banks do not have specific procurement
procedures.  They rely on the borrowers to obtain goods and services from
the most advantageous sources.
C. The Investment and Development Bank
Experience with Past Bank Group Lending to INDEBANK
2.11      The first Bank line of credit to INDEBANK (US$3.0 million) was
approved in-July 1978. The principal objectives of the loan were to: (i)
assist the development of Malawi's Industrial sector by providing foreign
exchange resources to INDEBANK for financing productive medium- and
large-scale investments, and (ii) strengthen INDEBANK's Institutional
capabilities by helping it to develop adequate policies and procedures.
Disbursements of the Bank loan were completed in July 1983 and a Project
Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared recently. OED does not plan to
carry out an audit of this project. The PCR concluded that the objectives
of the Bank loan had substantially been met: projects financed with the
proceeds of the loan had been fully implemented and were operating
profitably. The Bank played an important role in building INDEBANK into a
strong and efficient institution. Overall, INDEBANK was receptive to Bank
advice during the loan implementation period. It consolidated its
policies, established and implemented adequate procedures and built up a
solid core of well-trained staff. INDEBANK, however, still has to overcome
some weaknesses in the area of project promotion, evaluation of the



- 18 -
economic impact of projects it finances and management and staffing of its
Agricultural Projects Division.  The proposed project aims at helping
INDEBANK overcome these weaknesses in order to play a more effective role
in the development of the Malawian economy.
Objectives and Role
2.12      INDEBANK was established in December 1972 as a private limited
liability Company under Malawi's Companies Act. Its basic objective is to
promote the economic development of Malawi by providing finance and other
services to viable projects in the productive sectors of the economy. It
provides medium- and long-term loans and makes equity investments mainly in
industrial, agricultural and commercial projects sponsored by private or
public investors. INDEBANK gives preference to projects sponsored and
financed by Malawian interests and encourages foreign investors to find
local partners.
Ownership and Board
2.13      INDEBANK is owned 22.25X each by ADMAKC which is wholly
Government-owned, the Coimonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the
German Finance Company for Investments in Developing Countries (DEG), and
the Netherlands Finance Company for Developing Countries (FM0); and 11% by
IFC.  INDEJANK's capital-authorized and fully paid-amounts to K 4.5
million (US$2.5 million). In addition to paid-in share capital, the
shareholders (with the exception of IFC) have provided INDEMANK with
additional resources in the form of income notes amounting to K 11.25
million (US$b.2 million). The income notes are unsecured, bear an interest
rate of 8Z p.a. and are repayable by the year 2020. The rights and
obligations of the Government, the institution and the ehareholders are set
out in the Finance and Corporation Agreement signed in December 1972 by the
Government of Malawi, INDEBANK and its shareholders.  INDEBANK's Board of
Directors consists of eight members including a representative of ADMAMC,
who is also the Chairman, two members, each representing CIC, DIG and FMO,
and a representative of the IFC. The Board meets four times a year at the
end of each quarter. The Board members, all senior people in their
respective organizations, take an active interest in INDEBANK's
activities. Their guidance has been instrumental In helping INDEBANK
develop into a sound, pr_iitable institution.
Organization and Management
2.14      INDEBANK's organization chart is presented in Annex 4.  The
INDEBANK organization is simple and 1has remained unchanged since inception
in 1972. It comprises three divisions: (i) the Project Investigation
Division which deals with the identification and appraisal of projects;
(ii) the Project Monitoring Division which handles the implementation and
supervision of projects, and (iii) the Company Secretary/Financial
Controllers' Division which is responsible for accounting, financial
management, administration and legal matters. Except for the lack of a
unit specifically responsible for project promotion (para. 2.22),
INDEBANK's organization is appropriate for ilts objectives and operations.



- 19 -
2.15      Overall, INDEBANK' s management is dedicated and competent.  All
management positions in INDEBANK, with the exception of the General Manager
and the Coordinator of Project Investigations, are held by Malawian
nationals. The General Manager and the Coordinator of Project
Investigations are seconded from the Irish Development Authority (IDA).
The General Manager's contract is due to end in August 1986. The INDEBANK
Board has recently appointed as Assistant General Manager a Nalawian who is
expected to replace the expatriate General Manager when his contract
expires. The position of Financial Advisor, previously occupied by an
expatriate funded by the Dutch Government, has been vacant for about two
years. INDEBANK has been looking for funding and a suitable expatriate to
fill this position. The West German Government, under a technical
assistance program for Malawi, is expected to provide an expatriate to fill
the position of Financial Advisor. Management of the Agricultural Projects
Department remains weak followiag the departure of the expatriate manager
in 1982. Thus, although INDEBANK plans to participate in the financing of
agricultural estate activities under the agricultural credit component of
the proposed project, it does not currently have a full capability to
effectively promote, appraise and monitor agricultural projects. The
proposed project would support strengthelling of INDEBANK's institutional
capability in agricultural lending through financing the cost of employing
key staff for the Agricultural Projects Department (para. 3.04).
Staffing, Staff Development and Training
2.16      As of March 31, 1985, INDEBANK had a professional staff of 26
including the General Manager and the Coordinator of Project
Investigations. Overall, the staff is of good quality. The majority of
the staff have solid academic backgrounds. Thirteen of the 26 professional
staff are University graduates with qualifications mostly in Economics or
Business Administration. The rest of the staff possess junior college
diplomas in banking and business studies and several have obtained or are
studying for professional qualifications in accountancy. The majority of
the staff have been with INDEBANK for four to five years and have gained
considerable experience in their jobs and are highly productive. In order
to meet effectively the manpower requirements of its managed subsidiaries,
especially INDEFUND, as well as to develop adequate professional staff to
manage its own operations, INDEBANK plans to recruit four additional
project officers within the next 12 moaths. With the recruitment of the
expatriate Financial Advisor, Agricultural Projects Investigation Manager,
Agronomist and six additional Project Officers, INDEBANK will have in place
adequate manpower to carry out its planned activities in the next
three-five years.
2.17      INDEBANK has been active in providing training to its staff.
Each year, INDEBANK prepares a comprehensive three-year staff training
plan. While emphasis is placed on providing on-the-job training, INDEBANK
sends its staff to selected training programs overseas. In the past five
years, four staff have taken post-graduate courses in financial management
and business administration and five other staff have attended short-term



- 20 -
courses in project appraisal in the UK and USA. INDEBANK provides
financial support to staff members taking correspondence courses for
further qualifications in accountancy and banking. In the next
two years, INDEBANK plans to send three staff members to the UK to complete
studies for their professional accounting qualifications and 12 staff
members to short-term courses in project promotion, appraisal and financial
management. INDEBANK's staff development and training activities are
adequate.
Policies and Procedures
2.18      For its investment decisions and day-to-day operations, INDEBANK
is guided by a Statement of Investment Policy Principles and Operating
Procedures adopted in 1978 in connectiom with the first Bank line of credit
to INDEBANK. This statement ennunciates investment policy and operating
procedures that were devised at the time INDEBANK was established In 1972.
Policies
2.19      The salient features of IND_BANK's investment policies are that
the institution will:
(a) base its investment decisions on sound appraisal criteria
including technical feasibility, economic and financial soundness
of projects;
(b) encourage local participation in its projects;
(c) limit its equity investment in any one project to no more than
351 of the project's total equity; and,
(d) maintain a prudent ratio between its overall equity and loan
investment.
2.20      Lnding Terms:  As working capital financing for viable projects
Is readily avai1ab e from the commercial banks, INDEBANK mainly provides
long-term loans with maturities of 8 to 12 years including grace periods of
one to two years. In some cases, INDEBANK also provides medium-term loans
of up to five years to projects that are easy to implement and that sbow
potential for repaying the loans over a five-year period. Security is
taken in form of a lien over the projects' assets and the personal
guarantees of the borrowing company's directors. Overall, INDEBANK's loans
are adequately secured. In order to protect itself against foreign
exchange risk on its foreign currency borrowings, INDEBANK passes on the
foreign exchange risk to sub-borrowers.
2.21      INDEBANK's lending rates which are not controlled by the Reserve
Bank of Malawi 2/ range from 131 p.a. to 16% p.a. The minimum rate of 131
p.a. is charged on loans denominated in foreign exchange and on projects
that are considered to be of high developmental value to the country.
2, The Reserve Bank of Malawi sets the interest rates for financial
institutions that are registered under the Banking Act. INDEBANK was
established under the Companies Act.



- 21 -
Interest rates higher than 13Z p.a. are charged mainly on local currency
loans for trade-related activities. INDEBANK also charges a one-time
commitment fee of 0.5% of the amount of the loan as well as a project
appraisal fei of 1Z of the value of the loan once the project is approved.
In view of Lne current inflation rate estimated around 12% (para. 1.39),
the interest rates (14-16%) charged by INDEBANK on its local currency loans
are adequate to ensure INDEBANK's continued profitability. The lower
interest rate of 13% p.a. charged on loans denominated in foreign exchange
is also adequate given the rates of inflation in the countries where
INDEBANK's obtains its foreign exchange resources, as well as the average
cost (about 9%) of these funds which allows INDEBANK an average spread of
about 4% on its foreign exchange resources. Since sub-borrowers bear the
foreign exchange risk, the effective cost in local currency of foreign
currency denominated loans to sub-borrowers is higher than 13% p.a. It is
anticipated that, as in the past, INDEBANK will continue to revise its
lending rates to take into iccount ehanges in the level of domestic
inflation, and In deposit and lending rates in the country. Since the line
of credit to INDEBANK will carry a variable interest rate, INDEBANK plans
to adopt a variable interest rate policy. During negotiations it was
agreed that INDEBANK will annually review and revise its lending rates to
ensure that its interest rates are: (i) positive in real term; (1i) in
line with the overall interest rate structure in the country; (iii)
adequate to enable INDEBANK to cover its reasonable administrative
expenses, provide for possible losses on its loans and earm an adequate
profit margin; and (iv) adequate to permit the attainment of the objectives
of the project.
Procedures
2.22      Project Promotion:  INDEBANK has not yet developed an adequate
project promotion capability; as such, it has not utilized fully Its
Institutional resources and capabilities to foster the growth of productive
activity in the country.  Most of the projects financed have been promoted
by the three major holding companies-PGL, ADMARC and MDC.  As a result,
INDEBANK's level of operations depends to a large extent on the investment
activities of these three companies (para. 2.29). INDEBANK is aware of the
need to develop in-house project promotion capability in order to increase
its volume of operations and to progressively reduce the concentration of
its portfolio in projects controlled by the Press Group, ADMARC and MDC.
During negotiations, INDEBANK agreed to establish a Project Promotion Unit
and recruit by June 30, 1986, two experienced Malawian professional staff
to carry out project promotion.
2.23      Appraisals:  INDEBANK's project appraisals have improved with the
building-up of staff experience and technical capabilities. After
management's clearance of a project brief, detailed appraisal is
undertaken, and the appraisal report is m:viewed before Board presentation
by a Loan Committee composed of the General Manager, the Coordinator of
Project Investigations and all Division Managers. Appraisal reports are
comprehensive and cover the project's key features in sufficient detail.
At this time, however, most appraisals do not assess in sufficient detail
the economic impact of proposed projects. During negotiations, INDEBANK
agreed to calculate economic rates of return for projects requiring
financing of more than US$100,000 as well as cover in sufficient detail
important aspects such as the projects' potential for creating employment
and dependence on imported inputs.



- 22 -
2.24      Supervision:  INDEBANK's project supervision is adequate.
Projects are supervised at least once a year. Reports on the performance
of selected projects are submitted to each Board meeting and INDEBANV seeks
its Board's guidance on measures for dealing with projects encountering
problems. The supervision reports are comprehensive and of high quality.
2.25      Agricultural Projects:  While INDEBANK has developed procedures
that, overall, are adequate for the appraisal and supervision of
non-agricultural projects, its capabilities for promoting, appraising and
monitoring agricultural projects remain weak. In order to strengthen
INDEBANK's capabilities in these areas, agreement was reached at
negotiations that INDEBANK will prepare by December 31, 1986, a manual
establishing appropriate procedures for the promotion, appraisal and
monitoring of agricultural projects.
2.26      Procurement and Disbursement:  INDEBANK's procurement procedures
are in line with procedures followed by Bank-assisted DFCs, namely on the
basis of competitive quotations from the main sources of supply to ensure
that purchases are made from the most advantageous source.
2.27      INDEBANK's equity and loan disbursements are made on the basis of
the investment program and the costs of each approved project, upon
presentation of invoices, once the sponsor's contributions have been fully
paid. In the majority of cases, payment is made directly to suppliers.
INDEBANK's procurement and disbursement are adequate and in line with
procedures normally applicable to DFC projects.
2.28      Audit:  INDEBANK's annual accounts are audited by Deloitte,
Haskins and-sells, a firm of international repute. Although the audits are
produced on time and are comprehensive, they have not conformed fully in
the past to the required format for audits of Bank Group assisted DFCs.
Agreement was reached with INDEBANK at negotiations that its audited
accounts will be prepared and presented along the lines indicated in the
Illustrative Form of Audit Reports for Development Finance Companies' and
submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of the financial year.
Operations and Portfolio
2.29      Operations:  As of December 31, 1984, INDEBANK had approved,
since it started operations in 1973, 86 loans and 21 equity investments for
a total of K 37.7 million (US$26.7 million).  INDEBANK's annual level of
operations in the past five years showed wide fluctuations. Approvals
declined from K 5.0 million in 1980 to an all time low of K 0.5 million in
1983 before rebounding to K 4.2 million in 1984. The decline in operations
between 1980-83 was due to two principal factors: (i) the sluggish growth
in the Malawian economy as a whole and especially in industrial activity
during this period, and (ii) a sharp decline in new investment activity by
the major Malawian conglomerates-PGL, MDC and ADMARC-which up to 1981,
either directly of through their subsidiaries financed projects jointly
with INDEBANK. In addition, the lack of a project promotion capability
within INDEBANK (para. 2.22) contributed to the decline in approvals.



- 23 -
INDEBANK's levels of commitments and disbursements over the past five years
exhibited a similar trend to the approvals. About 80% of amounts approved
were committed in the same year while 60% of amounts approved were
disbursed in the same year. A summary analysis of INDEBANK's operations
between 1980 and 1984 and its projected operations over the next five years
is presented in Annex 5.
2.30      INDEBANK has maintained a prudent approach in its lending
activities with a preference for medium-size projects. This approach is
reflected in the size of loans and the sectoral distribution of
investments. Out of K 32.3 million (US$22.8 million) in approvals for
loans to 86 projects between 1973 and 1984, 75X was for amounts ranging
between K 201,000 (US$142,210) and K 1 million (US$0.7 million); while
loans in amounts of over K I million represented only 13% of the total
amount approved. The sectoral distribution of total approvals indicates a
concentration in industry and commerce, which account for 62% of the number
of loans and 65% of the total amounts approved. Although agriculture is
Malawi's main economic activity, it accounted for only 20% of INDEBANK loan
approvals. INDEBANK's lending to agriculture remained small largely
because (i) the institution considers lending to this sector to be
relatively more risky, especially given the wide variations in the export
prices of the three dominant crops-tobacco, tea and sugar and (ii) it
lacked adequate capability in its Agricultural Projects Division to
appraise and monitor a sizeable agricultural projects portfolio (para.
2.25).
2.31      Given INDEBANK's private sector orientation, the majority of
approvals were to the private sector (including the Press Group) which
accounted for 58% and 62% of the total number and amounts of loans
approved, respectively. Seventy-one percent of the number of loans and 79%
of the total loan amount were for expansion projects, and the remainder for
new projects. INDEBANK's loan approvals, on average, had a maturity of
between six and ten years (about 72Z of Lhe number and 66Z of the value),
while the interest rates charged ranged between 10.5% and 15%.
2.32      As of March 31, 1985, INDEBANK had approved equity investments
amounting to K 5.4 million (US$3 million) in 21 companies. Equity
investments have averaged about K 500,000 (US$300,000) p.a. Due to adverse
economic conditions lilDEBANK did not approve any equity investments in 1982
and 1983. However, in 1984, there was a pick up in activity with equity
approvals of K 531,000 in one new and one existing project. INDEBANK's
equity holdings depict the same pattern as the loan portfolio. Companies
engaged in commerce and industry (including agro-industry) predominate with
76 percent of the number of investments and 67 percent of the amounts
approved. Other sectors include agriculture with 16 %, tourism (mainly
hotels) with 10% and financial services with 7%.
2.33      Portfolio:  As of December 31, 1984, INDEBANK's total portfolio
amounted to K 18.9 million (US$13.4 million) consisting of K 14.7 million
(US$10.4 million) in outstanding loans and K 4.7 million (USS3.3 million)
in equity investments. The sectoral distribution continues to favor
industry and commerce sectors which account for 59% of the portfolio.



- 24 -
Agriculture accounts for 17% while tourism and property development
constitute 14X and 10%, respectively. In spite of difficult economic
conditions in Malawi in the past five years, INDEBANK has maintained a very
good arrears record. As of December 31, 1984, only four projects involving
4% of the value of the loan portfolio were in arrears of over three
months-about the same proportion as in each of the last three years.  The
total arrears amounted to 1.5% of loans outstanding. Since inception,
INDEBANK has rescheduled eight loans (no more than one loan in a single
year) involving about K 3.4 million (US$1.9 million).
2.34      Although the projects in the loan portfolio have maintained a
very good debt service record as indicated by the low level of arrears, the
underlying quality of INDEBANK's portfolio is still of some concern because
of the portfolio's concentration in enterprises wholly or partly owned by
the Press Group, MDC, and ADMARC- Malawi's three largest holding
companies. As of December 1984, about 61% of INDEBANK's loan portfolio was
in enterprises wholly or partly owned by these three companies; as much as
23% of INDEBANK's portfolio was in projects in which the Press Group is the
largest investor and an additional 25Z in MDC projects. Although
individual loans are well secured, the overall safety of the portfolio will
continue to depend on these companies' financial performance and
condition. These conglomerates faced, between 1981-83, serious financial
and operational problems. Risks associated with the Press Group and MDC
have lessened substantially, however, following a major financial
restructuring and reorganization of these companies recently implemented
under the Second Structural Adjustment Credit (Credit 1427 of 1983).
ADMARC is currently facing serious liquidity problems due largely to its
statutory responsibility to purchase maize from smallholder farmers at a
price which is higher than the market clearing price, the loss of export
markets for that maize, a decl'ne in demand and the subsequent necessity to
store surplus grain at great cost. A request to the Bank to provide
assistance to ADMARC to enable it to overcome its pressing financial
problems is under consideration. In view of the potentially high risks
faced by the portfolio, INDEBANK has increased provisions for possible
losses. Accumulated provisions made in the past three years amount to
about 4% of the portfolio and are adequate. To reduce the concentration of
its portfolio in projects controlled by Press, MDC and ADMARC, INDEBANK is
expected to increase its project promotion capability (para. 2.22).
2.35      INDEBANK's equity portfolio of K 4.7 million (US$3.3 million) as
of December 31, 1984, consisted of 20 companies of which two were
wholly-owned non-profit subsidiaries (INDETRUST and INDETRUST Holdings),
two majority-owned sibsidiaries and eight associated companies (companies
in which INDEBANK holds between 20% and 35% of the equity). INDETRUST
provides pension and death benefit schemes for Malawian work rs whose
employcrs in both the private and public sectors elect to participate in
the scheme. INDETRUST Holdings holds investments on behalf of INDETRUST.
Overall, the equity portfolio is in very good condition. As of December
31, 1984, 14 companies (including the two non-profit INDEBANK subsidiaries)
were operating profitably; only three were unprofitable and three were
still under implementation. INDEBANK ownership in these companies range
from 2% of the soft drinks bottling company's share capital to 100% in the



- 25 -
two non-profit making subsidiaries; in most cases INDEBANK ownership is in
the 15-30X range. In addition to its equity holdings, INDEBANK had made
loans to these companies amounting K 3.2 million. In 1984, INDEBANK earned
an excellent return of about 16.4X on average equity portfolio.
Resources
2.36      Being a sound, well-managed and profitable institution, INDEBANK
enjoys a good reputation among bilateral and multilateral agencies and has
been successful in mobilizing sufficient resources to flaance its
operations. Up to March 31, 1985, INDEBANK had mobilized a total of K 39.6
million (US$22 million) in long-term resources consisting of: (i) K 4.5
million (US$2.5 million) in paid-up share-capital, (1i) K 11.25 million
(US$6.2 million) in income notes subscribed by the shareholders (para.
2.13) and K 13.9 million (US$7.7 million) equivalent In loans from CDC,
IBRD, EIB and ADB. These loans carry interest rates of around 92 p.a. and
have an average maturity of 15 years.
2.37      Although INDEBANK has had 12 years of profitable operations, it
still relies upon external agencies as its main source of financing.
INDEBANK recognizes the need to diversify Its sources of finance by
mobilizing domestic savings in Malawi and is planning to set up a leasing
company in which would start a deposit mobillzation operation. It is
anticipated, however, that obstacles such as lack of a branch network, the
lack of a capital market in the country and competition from the commercial
banks for a small domestic savings market could inhibit INDEBANK's ability
to effectively mobilize savings. During negotiations, INDEBANK agreed to
carry out by June 30, 1986, a study of its prospects for domestic savings
mobilization and to discuss the findings and recommendations with the
Bank. Such review will identify possible means through which INDEBANK
could mobilize domestic savings and the possible constraints to such
efforts, and will recomend measures for overcoming these constraints.
Financial Performance and Condition
2.38      INDEBANK has, since its Inception, maintained sound financia'
performance. INDEBANK's actual and projected financial statements and
ratios for the period 1980-89 are presented in Annexes 6 to 9. Over the
last five years, INDEBANK'S net profit averaged K 290,000 (US$161,000)
p.a., representing an average nominal return of 1.3Z on average total
assets and of 62 on equity. INDEBANK's net profit in each of the last four
years has been reduced by rapid increases in the level of provisions
against possible portfolio losses. As of December 31, 1984, provisions
represented 3.5% of the portfolio outstanding, up from 0.22 as of December
31, 1981. Despite increases in the mober of professional staff and staff
salary scales, INDEANRK's administrative expenses averaged 2.72 of average
total assets over the period 1980-84. The level of administrative expenses
In the past has been adequate in relation to INDEBANK's volume of
activities.



- 26 -
2.39      INDEBANK has maintained a sound liquidity position and an
adequate debt service capacity. Over the last five years, INDEBANK's
current ratio averaged 3.2%. As a result of new borrowings, INDEBANK's
debt-equity ratio increased steadily from 2.6:1 in 1980 to 4:1 as of
December 31, 1984-the limit agreed with the Bank under the first Bank line
of credit. Despite the increase in the debt-equity ratio, INDEBANK's debt
service capacity remains satisfactory with a debt service coverage ratio of
1.6 at the end of December 1984. Overall, INDEBANK's financial condition
remains sound.
Prospects
2.40      Future Operations.  INDEBANK's projected operations for FY85/89
are shown in Annex 5. Total approvals are projected to increase by 15X
p.a. in nominal terms from K 5.0 million (US$2.8 million) in FY85 to K 8.7
million (US$4.8 million) by FY89. Total approvals over the five-year
period would thus amount to K 33.6 million (US$18.7 million) of which K 3.7
million (US$2 million) would be in equity investments, K 10 million (US$5.6
million) in local currency loans and K 19.9 million (US$11 million) in
foreign currency loans. Commitments and disbursements are projected at 75Z
and 60% of the level of approvals in each year respectively.
2.41      The above projections are realistic and are supported by a
pipeline of 28 projects as of March 31, 1985, with an aggregate investment
value of K 17 million (US$9.4 million). INDEBANK expects to provide total
financing of K 12.8 million, i.e., about 751 of total project costs.
Several of the projects in the pipeline are either ready for submission to
the Board or are at an advanced stage of preparation. The pipeline
reflects INDEBANK's efforts in the past two years to progressively
diversify its operations away from investments controlled by the Prass
Group, ADMARC and MDC. About 70% of the number of projects in the pipeline
aud 781 of the value of proposed investments would be in projects In which
none of the three conglomerates would hold a controlling interest. Thus
the operations of the three conglomerates are not expected to have as a
significant impact on INDEBANK's operations as they did in the past. In
line with its previous lending policy, 571 of the 28 projects in the
pipeline are in the industrial sector, 361 in agro-industry and 71 in
agriculture.  It is, however, anticipated tha. with the funds available
under the technical assistance component (para. 3.04) and with the proposed
strengthening of INDEBANK's capability to promote, appraise and monitor
agricultural projects, the proportion of INDEBANK's lending to agriculture
will increase over the next three years.
2.42      In order to ensure that INDEBANK maintains within prudent limits
its exposure in any one projeet, it was agreed under the first Bank loan
that INDEBANK would limit its financial assistance in any one project to a
maximum of 251 of INDEBANK's net worth. It was agreed, however, that for
purposes of projects of national importance, INDEBANK could, after
consultation with the Bank and the Government, extend financial assistance
in excess of the above limit provided that the repayment of the principal
and interest of th. portion of the loan in excess of the 251 limit would be
fully guaranteed by the Government. At negotiations, INDEBANK agreed to



- 27 -
maintain the exposure limit in any one project as specified above. It was
also agreed under the first Bank loan that INDEBANK's total equity
investments would not exceed 120% of its net worth. At negotiations
INDEBANK also agreed to maintain the above limit on its total equity
investments.
2.43      Resource Requirements.  INDEBANK's resource requirements over the
three-year period January 1986 through December 1988 are expected to amount
to K 21.9 million (US$12.2 million), as detailed below:

agricultural projects.



- 28 -
2.44      INDEBANK's total new resources over the three-year period,
January 1986 to December 1988 are expected to amount to K 22.4 million
(US$12.4 million) including K 17.0 million (US$9.4 million) In new lines of
credit. These resources would be sufficient to meet INDEBANK's expected
commitments (para. 2.40). It is not anticipated that INDEBANK would face
any difficulties in raising additional resources if Its volume of
operations exceeds projected levels. Anj resource gaps would be financed
by either new lines of credit or by additional issue of income notes by the
shareholders. On the basis of current projections, the line of credit to
INDEBANK of US$3 million (K 5 million) under the loan recommended in this
report would represent about 25% of INDEBANK's total resource mobilization
and about 30% of its foreign exchange resource requirements for financing
projects in the industrial, commercial, transport and tourism sectors. It
is anticipated that INDEBANK will utilize about K 2 million from the
proceeds of the agricultural credit component to finance agricultural
projects.
2.45      Projected Financial Performance and Condition.  INDEBANK's
projected financial statements and ratios for the period 1985-89 are shown
in Annexes 6 through 9. Due to a gradual increase in the average cost of
INDEBANK's borrowed resources, its financial expenses as a percentage of
average total assets are projected to increase from 6X in 1985 to 6.7Z in
1989. Largely as a result of planned staff recruitment and training, and
of the need to finance the contracts of expatriate managers, administrative
expenses are expected to increase to an average of 3.9Z of average total
assets up from an average 2.7Z over the previous five-year period. This
level of administrative expenses appears high in relation to INDEBANK's
planned operations. In order to ensure that administrative expenses are
gradually brought down to a reasonable level, agreement was reached at
negotiations that INDEBANK will annually review the level of its
administrative expenses with the Bank and will implement such measures as
will be dgreed upon to reduce the level of these expenses. Despite the
projected increase in financial and administrative expenses, INDEBANK's
profitability is expected to grow steadily. The return on average total
assets over the forecast period is expected to increase to an average of
1.6Z p.a. up from 1.3Z during the previous five-year period. Likewise the
return on net worth is expected to average about 8.9% p.a.-a significant
increase from an average return of 5.9% during the previous five-year
period.
2.46      INDEBANK's financial condition is projected to remain
satisfactory over the next five years. Its current ratio and debt service
coverage ratio are expected to average 2.8 and 1.5 respectively. As a
result of planned borrowings, INDEBANK's debt-equity ratio is pr"tjected to
increase from 4:1 as of December 31, 1984, to 4.9:1 by the end of FY89.
Under the existing Loan Agreement for the first Bank line of credit,
INDEBANK agreed to maintain a debt-equity ratto of 4:1. The Bank agreed,
however, that it would be prepared to raise the debt-equity ratio to 5:1
provided that (i) the limit of 4:1 became a constraint on INDEBANK's
ability to raise new financial resources; and (ii) INDEBANK's financial
condition and investLwent portfolio continued to be sound, INDEBANK has now
requested that the deot-equity ratio limit be raised to 5:1. In view of
INDEBANK's maturity as a financial institution, the sound quality of Its
portfolio and a good record of prudent financial management and



- 29 -
performance, a debt-equity ratio of 5:1 is appropriate. During
negotiations, it was agreed that INDEBANK will maintain a debt-equity ratio
of 5:1. It was further agreed that for the purpose of determining
INDEBANK's debt-equity ratio, those portions of outstanding income notes
(para. 2.13) on which the holders have waived the right to early payment
during the authorization period of the Bank loan, would be treated as part
of INDEBANK's equity.
INDEBANK's Small/Medium-Scale Lending Activities
2.47      In 1981, IN'6BANK set up a subsidiary company, INDEFUND 1imited,
to provide financing for projects ranging in size from K 25,000-the
maximum project size eligible for funding under the Government small-scale
industries program to K 100,000-the minimum loan size allowed under
INDEBANK's policies. INDEFUND was established with a paid-in share capital
of K 650,000 (authorized share capital is K 1 million), of which 62Z is
subscribed by INDEBANK and 38Z by "M0.
2.48      INDEFUND has an independent Board and management.  However, the
General Manager of INDEBANK plays a major role in the running of INDEFUND,
particularly in matters relating to policy and investment decisions. While
INDEFUND has made good progress in the recruitment and development of its
staff, it still relies on INDEBANK professional staff in the areas of
accounting, financing, management and project appraisal.
2.49      As of January 31, 1985, INDEFUND had approved 45 loans amounting
to K 1.8 million (US$1.0 million) of which K 1.1 million (US$0.6 million)
had already been disbursed. The average loan size was about K 50,000
(US$27,800). INDEFUND charges a minimum Interest rate of 12% p.a. on loans
for agricultural activities and up to 15% on other loans. The majority of
INDEFUND loans are for a term of five years including a one-year grace
period. The projects cover all sectors including manufacturing,
agriculture, agro-processing, pri'. ing and commerce.
2.50      INDEFUND has made losses since izs establishment in 1981.  Losses
for FY84 of K 130,000 (US$91,976) have increased significantly from K 7,400
(US$7,000) in FY82. INDEFUND's shareholders expect its financial condition
to improve once the start-up phase is completed with the recruitment of new
staff and a sufficient build-up of business volume. INDEFUND will need
continued financial and technical support from its shareholders and
international bilateral and multilateral lending agencies. To date,
INDEFUND has funded its loan portfolio principally from foreign loan
sources. Current funding sources include KFW with K 2.5 million (US$1.4
million), FMO K 600,000 (US$333,300) and a pledge of about K 2 million
(US$1.1 million) by USAID. These loans have not adversely affected
INDEFUND's debt to equity ratio which stood at 2:1 as of December 1984.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Description
3.01      Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed project are
to: (i) improve the utilization, efficiency and productivity of
agricultural estates, particularly of tobacco estates, in Malawi and
gradually encourage diversification into viable new crops by providing



- 30 -
credit for medium- and long-term investments through INDEBANK and the
commercial banks; (ii) sustain and strengthen INDEBANK's institutional
capabilities to play a more effective role in promoting the efficient
development of the agricultural, industrial and other productive
activities; and (iii) to stimulate the efficient expansion of Malawi's
industrial, commercial, transportation and tourism subsectors by providing
them with much needed term financing for investment through a line of
credit to INDEBANK.
3.02      Description.  The proposed Bank loan would consist of three
components: (i) the INDEBANK line of credit component (US$3.0 million)
would provide resources to INDEBANK to finance part of the foreign exchange
requirements of its planned operations over a three-year period in the
industrial, comercial, transport and tourism sectors; (ii) the pilot
agricultural credit component (US$4.5 million) would make available by the
Government, through the Reserve Bank of Malawi, resources to INDEBANK, NBM
and CBM to provide medium- and long-term credit to agricultural estates;
(iii) the technical assistance component (US$0.3 million) would provide
INDEBANK with resources to employ two experienced expatriate staff and two
Malawian counterpart staff to strengthen its capability to promote,
appraise and monitor agricultural projects.
Terms and Conditions
3.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$7.8 million would be made to the
Government of Malawi on standard terms. The INDEBANK line of credit
component (US$3 million) of the Bank loan would be repayable in acecrdance
with a schedule that would conform substantially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules applicable to the subloans made by INDEBANK under
the industrial component. The maximum repayable period would be 15 years
Including four years of grace. The balance amount of US$4.8 million would
be repayable over 15 years including four years of grace.
3.04      The Government of Malawi would utilize the proceeds of the Loan
as follows:
(a) INDEBANK Line of Credit Component: The Government would on-lend
to INDEBANK under a subsidiary line of credit loan agreement, US$3 million
at a variable interest rate (equal to the rate charged from time to time on
the proposed Bank loan). The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of disbursement of the line
of credit to INDEBANK. INDEBANK would relend the funds at a variable
interest rate and with maturities of up to 15 years including appropriate
grace periods. INDEBANK's current interest rate is 13 percent p.a.
Subborrowers would bear the exchange rate risk. In order to ensure that
the Bank funds are used to finance as many projects as possible, it was
agreed at negotiations that INDEBANK would not use Bank funds in excess of
US$750,000 equivalent to finance any one enterprise. INDEBANK would have a
free limit of US$250,000 for individual subprojects and an aggregate free
limit of US$1.5 million. INDEBANK would calculate the economic rate of
return on all subprojects requiring World Bank financing of more than
US$100,000 (para. 2.23).
(b) Agricultural Estate Credit Component: US$4.5 million would
be made available under three separate participating Bank agreements to
the three participating financial intermediaries--NBM, CBM and INDEBANK



- 31 -
on a first come, first served basis. The execution of a participating
bank agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between the RBM and a
participating institution would be a condition of disbursement of the
proceeds of the component to that institution. For this purpose a Special
Account (para. 3.09) would be established in the REM with an initial
deposit of approximately US$400,000, sufficient to cover about four months
of anticipated loan disbursements by the participating institutions. The
account would be replenished periodically in accordance with agreed
procedures. Participating institutions would use these resources to
provide medium- and long-term financing to the estate subsector.
Participating banks would initially pay 10.5% p.a. interest on the amounts
withdrawn from the Special Account and would relend the funds for periods
ranging between three and ten years at interest rates ranging between
11.5% and 15% p.a. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the RBM
will annually review and revise, as appropriate, its on-lending rate to
the participating banks to reflect changes in the interest rates on
agricultural loans. Because of possible fluctuations in the prices of the
main crops, agricultural estates in Malawi face substantially higher risks
than industrial enterprises. In order to protect agricultural
sub-borrowers from further risks, the Government would bear both the
variable interest rate risk and the exchange rate risk on sublo3us to
agricultural estates. The difference between the IBRD lending rate and
the rate paid by the participating banks would go towards cozvering the
variable interest rate risk and the foreign exchange risk. The repayment
periods would not exceed the useful life of the assets being financed.
Subloans would be given to estate owners who have clear right to the land,
who have competent management and who can demonstrate the technical
feasibility and financial viability of the proposed investment. Subloans
would be available for land improvement including: irrigation and
drainage; establishment and improvement of infrastructure e.g., curing
barns, storage sheds, processing facilities; purchase and improvements of
farm equipment and machinery; purchase of livestock; and rehabilitation of
estates with the objective of improving management and productivity. The
sub-borrower's contribution, which may be in cash or kind, will be
determined by a participating bank on the basis of its appraisal of the
investment proposal. In order to ensure that the proceeds of the
component benefit as many projects as possible, it was agreed at
negotiations that the maximum size of a subloan (except for irrigation
subprojects) would be K 450,000 (US$250,uOO). For irrigation subprojects,
subloans of up to K 900,000 (US$500,000) vwuld be allowed. The estate
subsector has not had access to term credit which has resulted in pent up
demand for credit to finance medium- and long-term investments. To
satisfy part of this backlog and to accelerate project benefits the
project would provide for retroactive financing of up to K 1.5 million
(US$0.8 million) to finance eligible subprojects approved after July 1,
1985. It was agreed at negotiations that as a condition of disbursement
of funds set aside for retroactive financing, a sample of subprojects to
be financed retroactively would require approval of the Bank.
(c) Technical Assistance Component: The Government would provide a
grant of US$0.3 million to INDEBANK to help the institution strengthen it3
capabilities to promote, appraise and monitor agricultural projects in



- 32 -
order to expand its role in agricultural lending. Proceeds of this
component would finance the cost of employing for a term of three years, a
Manager for the Agricultural Projects Department with experience in
agricultural credit operations and an experienced agronomist. In view of a
shortage of Malawians with the required experience, it is expected that
INDEBANK will recruit expatriates to fill these positions, In addition,
proceeds of the technical assistance component would be utilized to finance
the cost of employing two suitably qualified Malawian counterparts. The
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment for the
persons selected for the positions of the Manager for the Agricultural
Projects Department and the Agronomist would be approved by the Bank.   It
was agreed at negotiations that INDEBANK would fill these positions by June
30, 19d6. It was further agreed that hiring of the Manager for the
Agricultural Projects Department would be a condition of disbursement of
the agricultural line of credit to INDEBANK.
Project Implementation
3.05      Reporting and Audit Requirements.  INDEBANK would be required to
submit quarterly reports which would include a summary of operations,
financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears, collection
ratios and notes on the situation of projects in the portfolio in
difficulties. INDEBANK would also be required to submit within six months
following the end of each fiscal year, annual audited accounts prepared in
accordance with the Bank Group guidelines for audit of DFCs, by qualified
auditors approved by the Bank. NBM and CBM would be required to submit
quarterly reports which would include details of the subloans approved aid
committed, and a summary analysis of the status of implementation and
performance of subprojects financed under the agricultural credit component
of the project. The two commercial banks would be required to submit their
annual audited accounts as soon as they would be available but no later
than nine months after the close of their financial years. INDEBANK, NBM
and CBM would also be required to maintain separate records of transactions
relating to the financing of agricultural subprojects, based on which
statements of expenditures will be prepared and against which the
participating banks will seek reimbursement from RBM (para. 3.09). The
audit of the accounts relating to the statement of expenditures would be
included in the audit reports to be submitted by INDEBANK, NBM and CBM.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that INDEBANK, NBM and CBM will
comply with these reporting and audit requirements.
3.06      Procurement.  Procurement of goods under the INDEBANK line of
credit component of the project would be in accordance with INDEBANK's
procurement practices which are adequate (para. 2.26).
3.07      Most equipment and materials to be financed under the
agricultural credit component would be available locally. Neither
international nor local competitive bidding would be feasible under this
component because the size of individual investments would be too small and
bulking of contracts is not practicable because of their diversity and the
wide dispersal of estates in Malawi. Machinery and equipment would be
acquired through ordinary commercial channels in which both local and
foreign firms operating in Malawi participate. Private contractors are
available for construction of civil works on a competitive basis.



- 33 -
Diabursements
3.08      The proceeds of the loan would be used for financing:
(a)    Under the INDEBANK line of credlt component:
(i) 100% of the cif cost of imported goods and services needed
for the implementation of eligible subprojects;
(ii) up to 75% of the local cost of goods previously imported into
Malawi;
(iii) up to 50% of the cost in local currency of eivil works
included in subprojects; and
(b)       100% of the smounts disbursed under the agriculture credit and
technical assistance components.
3.09      In order to facilitate disbursement of funds under the project,
agreement was reached at negotiations that two Special Accounts would be
established: Speclal Account Number 1 would be established and
administered by the Reserve Bank of Malawi. From this account, INDEBANK,
NBM and CBM would claim reimbursement against Statement of Expenditures
relating to the sgricultural credit component. Special Account Number 2
would be opened in a financial institution acceptable to the Bank and would
be administered by INDEBANK. From this account, INDEBANK would claim
reimbursement agalnst Statement of Expenditures relating to the INDEBANK
line of credit and technical assistance components. Each Special Account
would be initially started with an advance of US$400,000 out of the
proceeds of the Bank loan, and would be replenished by the Bank
subsequently in accordance with agreed procedures. The establishment of
the Special Accounts would be a condition of disbursement of funds under
the projects
3.10      The estimated disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 10.
Disbursement of the industrial credit component is in line with the
region-wide sectoral disbursement profile for IDF projects. Assuming the
loan becomes effective in the first quarter of PY86, it is antielpated that
funds under this component would be committed by December 31, 1989, and
disbursed by the fourth quarter of FY93. Beeause of the large backlog of
demand for medium/long-term agricultural credit, it is expected that the
proceeds of the agricultural credit component would be committed by
December 1988 and disbursed by the end of FY90. The 100% financing of
amounts approved for term agricultural subloans is justified since World
Bank funds would represent only a small part of the resources required to
implement projects. The commercial banks would provide seasonal credit and
project sponsors would make their own contri-ution to project costs.
Proceeds of the technical assistance component are expected to be disbursed
by the end of FY89. The last date for submission of all subprojects under
the project will be December 31, 1989, and the closing date June 30, 1993.
Pilot Agricultural Credit Component Implementation Review
3.11      In addition to regular project supervision, the Bank would, in
cooperation with the Government, carry out a review, approximately two
years after project effectiveness, to assess progress made in achieving the

objectives of the pilot agricultural credit component. During the review,
special attention would be given to assessincr (a) commercial bank
effectiveness in implementing the agricultural credit component; (b) the
level of demand; (c) the structure of interest rates for agricultural
lending; and (d) the effectiveness of the management training and extension
service.
Benefits and Risks
3.12      The INDEBANK line of credit component of the proposed project
would support the sustenance and further strengthening of INDEBANK's
institutional capabilities to play a more effective role in promoting the
efficient development of productive economic activities. By developing its
project promotion capabilities as envisaged under the project, INDEBANK
would be able to expand and diversity its operations away from its
traditional lending to activities dominated by the Press Group, ADMARC and
MDC. The project would also enable INDEBANK to create new investment and
employment opportunities in Malawi by promoting and financing projects in
productive sectors. Based on the experience with the first Bank line of
credit to INDEBANK, it is estimated that the projects partly financed with
the proceeds of the proposed line of credit would help create about 500 new
jobs at an average investment cost per job of about US$45,000.
3.13      The pilot agricultural credit component of the project would help
foster economic recovery in Malawi through provision of investment credit
(that has hitherto not been available to the agricultural estates
subsector) to strengthen the existing production base and increase
agricultural production on land held in the estate subseLcor, and would
support Government's efforts to initiate crop diversification. The pilot
component would provide a basis for better assessment of investment credit
needs and the suitability of the existing institutional framework to
effectively administer term credit to the agricultural estates subsector.
The benefits of the pilot agricultural credit component cannot be
quantified since the mix of investments which would be financed under the
component would depend on market prospects of the crops grown an the
estates. The technical assistance component would enable INDEBANK to
strengthen its agricultural lending capability and expand its role in
financing agricultural projects tbereby contributing to the development of
Malawi's most important sector.
3.14      The main risk associated with the project is that the estate
crops (especially tobacco) are produced for the export market and a
substantial drop in the international prices of these crops could result In
liquidity problems for sub-borrowers and in defaults on loan repayments.
However, according to a Bank forecast, prices of Malawi's major export
crops in constant US dollars are expected to remain relatively stable in
the medium term; these prices are forecast to drop below current prices by
no more than 7% up to 1990. Also, gradual diversification of estate crops
would help to reduce the vulnerability of estate farmers to the vagaries of
international price movements. The term credit to be provided estate
farmers will also help to make then more efficient, lower cost producers
who will be better able to withstand price fluctuations. Finally,
participating financial intermediaries are expected to carefully review
potential sub-borrowers so as to screen out those who are not good credit
risks.

possible losses and earn adequate profit margins, and adequate to
permit the attainment of the objectives of the project (para.
2.08);
(ii) on-lend US$3.0 million to INDEBANK and US$4.5 million to
INDEBANK, NBM and CBM under subsidiary loan agreements

disbursement of the proceeds of the agricultural credit component
(para. 3.09); and (ii) assist INDEBANK to establish a Special
Account to facilitate disbursement of the proceeds of the
INDEBANK line of credit component and of the technical assistance
component (para. 3.09).
(c)  With INDEBANK that it will:
(i) recruit by June 30, 1986, under terms acceptable to the Bank, a
Ma-nager for the Agricultural Projects Department with
experience in agricultural credit, an experienced Agronomist and
two counterpart staff to strengthen the Department (para. 3.04);
(ii) annually review its interest rates to ensure that these rates are
(a) positive in real terms, (b) in line with the overall interest
rate structure in the country, (c) adequate to enable INDEBANK to
cover its reasonable administrative expense, provide for possible
losses on its loans and earn an adequate profit margin, and (d)
adequate to permit attainment of the objectives of the project
(para. 2.21);
(iii) establish a Project Promotion Division and recruit by June 30,
1986, two experienced Malawian professional staff to carry out a
project promotion function (para. 2.22);
