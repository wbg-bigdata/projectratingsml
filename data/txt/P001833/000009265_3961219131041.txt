SECOND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Cr. 1658-MAU)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Livestock
Project in Mauritania, for which IDA Credit 1658-MAU, in the amount of SDR 7.2 million (US$
7.6 million equivalent) was approved on April 24, 1986, and made effective on June 30, 1987.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995, compared with the original closing date of
June 30, 1992. Final disbursement took place on December 12, 1995, at which time a balance of
SDR 3.1 million (equivalent to US$ 4.5 million at the current exchange rate) was canceled.
Cofinancing of the project was initially provided by AfDB, OPEC and domestic contributions. An
additional grant of 15 million NOK (US$ 2.2 equivalent) from the Government of Norway was
made effective on March 15, 1991.
The ICR was prepared by a mission in October 1995 from the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program consisting of Messrs. H. Trupke, FAO mission leader, and M. Moens,
agriculturalist/livestock specialist. It was reviewed by Mr. Randolph Harris, Division Chief,
AF5AE, and Mr. Emmerich Schebeck, Project Operations Advisor.
The ICR is based on material in the project files, field investigations and discussions
with Bank and Govemment staff associated with the project. The borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by arranging field visits and meetings, and by providing detailed data,
information and comments on the mission's aide-memoire. The borrower's evaluation is provided
in Annex B.

SECOND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Cr. 1658-MAU)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.          The Second Livestock Project was identified in December 1979, formulated by a
team of consultants in 1982, appraised in January 1986 and made effective on June 30, 1987.
Total project costs were estimated at US$ 18.1 million, with an IDA credit of US$ 7.6 million and
co-lending by the African Development Bank (AfDB) (US$ 6.3 million) and OPEC (US$ 2.0
million). Government counterpart finding was estimated at US$ 2.2 million equivalent.
Project Objectives
2.           The main project objectives were to slow the deterioration of grazing areas and
boost livestock productivity by the following means: making groups of pastoralists responsible for
allocated grazing areas; providing better extension services and production inputs; and contributing
to the store of knowledge of livestock production systems in order to help formulate a development
policy and plan future interventions in the sector. In order to achieve these objectives, the five-year
project consisted of six components: (i) a pilot component for the establishment of Pastoral
Cooperative Associations (PCAs); (ii) the study of livestock production systems, project
monitoring and the preparation of follow-on projects; (iii) distribution of inputs for sale to livestock
owners; (iv) strengthening of livestock services; (v) establishment of a livestock fund and a
production improvement fund; and (vi) construction of a small abattoir in Nouakchott. Project
objectives were highly relevant, but overly ambitious. In particular, the underlying financial and
legal reforms necessary to achieve project objectives were too complex.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.           The project got off to a very slow start and by mid-term (June 1990), only 300/o of
the IDA credit had been disbursed, as against an SAR target of 75%. The project was extended
three years past its original closing date of June 1992, until June 1995, and an additional grant of
NOK 15 million (US$ 2.2 million equivalent) was made available by the Government of Norway.
4.           Progress remained slow, however, and two instances of embezzlement were
discovered by the project's auditors in 1991 and 1992. Instead of suspending the credit, the Bank
chose to interrupt the replenishment of the special account.  The misallocated funds were
reimbursed by the Mauritanian treasury shortly afterwards. In addition to carrying out a radical



- iii -
streamlining of the project's components, the supervision mission of August 1993 also issued a
warning of credit suspension unless certain conditions were satisfied between October 30, 1993 and
January 31, 1994. These conditions were met by the Government.
5.           During the eight-year project period, 39 PCAs were created, of which 34 are
operational. Initially, these PCAs were extremely broad-based and rather ineffective. Since 1993,
22 of them have been restructured into much smaller functional groups. In 1993, a PCA water
supply program was initiated and a total of 68 wells were rehabilitated and 13 new boreholes
constructed. In 34 PCAs, sales depots for non-toxic veterinary inputs were established and a total
of 25 mini-projects (mainly for mnilk production) were implemented.
6.           In order to improve input supply, the project financed the establishment of a
Livestock Input Service (BIE) as a parastatal wholesale company, using the field stations of the
Livestock Department (DNE) as retail outlets. In 1993, to further advance the privatization
process, BIlE was transformed into a public limited company, and retailing now occurs mostly
through sales depots established by the PCAs and the private sector. Legal reforms introduced by
the project have also led to the liberalization of veterinary practices. Therefore, in this respect the
project has achieved its objective of providing better services and production inputs.
7.           The project did not succeed in reforming the financing of public livestock services.
Nevertheless, it did manage to partially strengthen these services through the construction and/or
rehabilitation of veterinary field stations, vaccination crushes, the installation of a radio
communication network, provision of vehicles, material and equipment, and staff training.
8.           As planned, a number of studies and monitoring surveys were carried out.
Unfortunately, however, the continued paucity of analytical data on the livestock sub-sector still
hampers the formulation of an adequate and realistic production and marketing policy and
constrains future interventions in the sector.
9.           Design work for the abattoir of Nouakchott started in 1987/88. Long delays in
tendering and bid evaluation and subsequent changes in the financing arrangements delayed
construction until early 1995. The facility has since been built and is operational.
10.          Costs and financing: Project costs have been re-estimated at US$ 11.5 million. As
of December 31, 1995,, a total of US$ 5.3 million had been disbursed out of the IDA credit of
US$ 7.6 mnillion. The low disbursement rate can be attributed to a reduced civil works program
and, to a lesser extent, to the devaluation of the UM against the US$, which led to reduced local
costs in US$ terms. The above costs do not include the US$ 2.2 million Norwegian Grant, which
was entirely disbursed, the US$ 2.0 million from the OPEC Fund, and US$ 3.2 million from the
AfDB.
11.          Key factors affecting outcomes: Project start-up and implementation were affected
by a number of factors.  Difficult policy decisions on privatization of services, financing
arrangements and the legal framework resulted in long delays prior to negotiations. Weak and
erratic project management in the early years, together with multi-donor funding with different



- IV -
procurement regulations and inadequate counterpart funding, led to substantial slippage and cost
increases in the civil works program during implementation.
12.          Bank and Borrower performance:  The Bank's performance was not always
satisfactory. The Bank should have realized early on that the creation of PCAs was not following
the SAR guidelines and that the project was achieving neither its physical targets nor its policy
objectives. No decisive action was taken until mid-1993, even after a negative mid-term review in
1990. Multi-disciplinary project supervision in the beginning could have saved the project. A
suspension of disbursements, together with a complete revarnping at mid-term, would have been
more appropriate than a simple three-year extension without a specific action plan.
13.          The Borrower's performance was extremely weak until 1993 and was characterized
by a lack of commitment to the project, as reflected in frequent changes in project management,
insufficient counterpart funding, a lack of will to make the necessary changes in the legal
framework, poor financial control and misappropriation of funds over the course of two
consecutive years. The Borrower's performance became satisfactory after the August 1993
supervision mission issued a set of conditions aimed at improving financial management.
14.          Assessment of project outcomes:  Although the project has been considered a
problem project for the entire duration of its implementation, it was ultimately successful in
establishing PCAs which are properly focused on target groups of beneficiaries. The 22 PCAs that
were restructured and appear sustainable could well serve as nuclei for development activities and
might also be spontaneously replicated in other areas, spurred by beneficiary demand. The
research and survey program has only partially served its purpose, since there is still no adequate
information or data base for future interventions. Therefore, the project can scarcely be said to
have laid the groundwork for future interventions in the livestock sub-sector.
15.          A major success of the project was the privatization of input supply and the
liberalization of veterinary services.  Also, the establishment of mini-projects was relatively
successful. In terms of physical infrastructure (field stations, tubewells, the abattoir, etc.), the
project achieved most of its objectives. This success, however, was partially nullified by the
conversion of some veterinary field stations into administrative centers following the
decentralization of MDRE services at regional level. The project also failed to create the required
legal framework for the allocation of grazing rights to pastoralists. This framework is essential to
maintaining pastoralists' interest in caring for and improving the resource base, a primary objective
of the project. The project also failed to create a sound financial footing for the field services of the
DNE. In light of the above, the overall project outcome must be rated as unsatisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons learned
16.          The most important finding is that an extremely broad-based and top-down
approach to the creation of PCAs does not yield the desired results. Subsequent restructuring and
revitalization of the project appears to have improved the situation, but the process remains
extremely cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive. Completely new and more cost-effective
approaches are needed to stimulate the emergence of pastoral groups.



17.          Some activities started under the project, such as the restructuring of the remaining
17 PCAs, stockwater and pasture development, and the provision of extension services, will
continue under the auspices of the DNE. At present, there is no intention to expand the PCA
program, nor is funding available for such expansion.
18.         The main lessons learned from the project are the following: (i) tapping a
community's organizational capacity and commitment to decision-making has proven extremely
effective, and hilds promise for the future; (ii) project design should always be kept simple, and
when problems are encountered during implementation, restructuring should aim to simplify even
more; and (iii) no project of this sort should be attempted unless a comprehensive government
implementation plan has been drawn up and relevant monitoring indicators have been identified.

SECOND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Cr. 1658-MAU)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.         Project Objectives
1.          The Second Livestock Project was designed to slow the deterioration of grazing
areas and to boost livestock productivity by: (i) making groups of pastoralists responsible for
allocated grazing areas; (ii) providing better services and production inputs; and (iii) increasing the
knowledge of livestock production systems essential for formulating a development policy and
planning future operations. The five-year project was to be implemented from June 1987 to June
1992 and had six components: (i) a pilot component for the establishment of pastoral cooperative
associations (PCAs); (ii) the study of livestock production systems, project monitoring and the
preparation of projects; (iii) distribution of inputs for sale to livestock owners; (iv) strengthening of
livestock services; (v) establishment of a Livestock Fund and a Production Improvement Fund
intended to provide the subsector with extra budgetary resources; and (vi) construction of a small
abattoir in Nouakchott.
2.           At appraisal, total project costs were estimated at US$ 18.1 million, with a foreign
exchange component of about 67%. Besides a domestic contribution of US$ 2.2 million, the
project was to be cofinanced by AfDB (US$ 6.3 million) and the OPEC Fund (US$ 2.0 million).
3.           By the mid-termn review (July 1990), it was evident that the project had hardly
achieved any of its objectives. Two modifications to the development credit agreement were
requested and granted: (i) a three-year extension of the closing date; and (ii) adjustments to the
timing of the declining disbursement percentages for operating costs. Moreover, an additional
grant of NOK 15 million (US$ 2.2 million equivalent) was provided by the Government of
Norway. Overall project objectives, however, remained unchanged.
4.           Only two and a half years later (August 1993), under the threat of credit
suspension, a supervision mission reached an agreement with Government on a major streamlining
of the project. The revised project focused mainly on: (i) strengthening and expansion of the PCA
program to include pastoral rights, pastoral water supply, pilot operations (micro-projects, pilot
pasture improvement, hay harvesting and veterinary inputs supply) and technical support, training
and extension; and (ii) construction of a small abattoir in Nouakchott.
5.           The project objectives were clear and important to the country and the sector. In
retrospect, however, they were overly ambitious, particularly the attempt to reform the financing of
public livestock services. The SAR correctly emphasized that the project entailed considerable
risks, due mainly to a lack of knowledge of the sub-sector at appraisal.



- 2 -
B.          Achievement of Project Objectives
Establishment of Pastoral Cooperative Associations
6.           The project was to establish 15 pilot PCAs in the provinces of Trarza, Brakna and
Gorgol, as well as in the westernmost districts of Tagant and Assaba.  Each association was
initially to consist of 30-50 pastoral households who traditionally grazed and migrated together.
The ultimate goal was to create associations of 400-500 families (8,000 to 10,000 head of
livestock) which would be responsible for managing and improving the range, in exchange for
which they were to be awarded grazing rights to well-defined areas. The creation of the PCAs was
to be assisted by mobile teams from the Direction Nationale de lElevage (DNE), which were also
supposed to provide: (a) animal health services; (b) extension services related to stockwater and
range management; (c) veterinary drugs, animal feed and other livestock supplies at fufl cost; and
(d) training for selected members of the associations as veterinary community assistants
(auxiliaires).
7.           By mid-term (July 1990), 17 PCAs had been established. However, they were
extremely broad-based and so large that services could not be delivered in a focused manner. The
mnid-term review found that this core project activity, as well as most others, had scarcely
progressed. During the August 1993 supervision, the project was asked to stop establishing new
PCAs and to instead restructure the existing ones according to the then-recent Cooperative Law of
January 1993. Since then, 22 PCAs have been restructured. In June 1994, the "Groupement
National des Associations Pastorales" (GNAP) was established as an umbrella organization for all
PCAs.
8.           Although the project was to finance, for each PCA, the repair of up to four existing
wells and the construction of one new borehole, the water supply program started only in 1993.
Sixty-eight existing wells were rehabilitated and 13 new boreholes constructed, with financial and
in-kind contributions of 10 % ofthe cost by PCA members. A water committee was established in
each PCA to manage the wells' operation and maintenance and to collect water fees, which include
a profit margin for amortization.
9.         It was also envisaged that the PCAs would operate their own retail outlets for non-
toxic drugs and feed, with a revolving fund to facilitate the purchase of stocks. At mid-term, only
6 of the 17 PCAs had a revolving fund for drugs. With the help of the Norwegian Grant, 28
additional revolving finds were established. Profits generated by drug sales appear adequate to
keep the input supply system functioning. However, revenues are not sufficient to cover the cost of
a permanent extension worker, and Government assistance is still required, particularly for daily
management and sanitary monitoring (diagnosis and prescription). Therefore, the component can
be viewed as partially success.fuL.
Systems Studies. Monitoring and Preparation of Follow-on Proiects
10.          The project was to finance studies and monitoring surveys to broaden and deepen
understanding of the livestock sub-sector. By the end of the implementation period, 30 such



- 3 -
studies and surveys had been carried out. Nine of those dealt with various aspects of the PCAs and
were particularly useful for adjusting project objectives after the mid-term review. Seven studies
focused on pasture management and helped in the selection of pilot sites for pasture management
and hay harvesting. The two systems studies identified the need for a proper policy framework,
which could not be finalized. Four statistical surveys created a limited database, and CNERV
carried out four studies on animal production, health and nutrition, and one on veterinary public
health.
11.        In addition, the project financed two socio-economic and hydrological surveys as a
basis for the water supply program, and helped create the required legal basis for the privatization
of veterinary services. Despite the numerous studies executed, the analytical data available on the
livestock sub-sector is still weak, and this is hampering the formulation of an adequate and realistic
production and marketing policy. The preparation of the follow-on project, the Projet de Gestion
des Ressources Naturelles en Zone Pluviale" (PGRATP), was financed under the consultant
category of the Credit and partly by a PPF. Although some activities carried out under this
component have not proven very useful, others (e.g., sociological surveys, follow-up project
preparation) have contributed to the project's development objectives.
Distribution of Production Input
12.          At appraisal, there was virtuaDly no distribution of production inputs to livestock
owners outside of Nouakchott. The project therefore financed the establishment of a Livestock
Input Service (Bureau des Intrants de I'Elevage - BIE) as the main wholesaler for veterinary
supplies, with financial autonomy based on profits generated. Retailing was to be carried out
through DNE's network of rural veterinary stations. BEE was poorly managed, however, and never
achieved financial autonomy. In order to reinforce privatization of veterinary supplies, BEE was
liquidated in 1993 and replaced with a public limited company, the Centrale d'Approvisionnement
des Intrants de I'Elevage (CAIE) with a board composed of government representaitves and
elected leaders of the PCAs. In future, government's participation in the CAIE will be further
reduced and the PCAs will constitute the majority of shareholders in the company. The project has
also initiated accompanying measures (veterinary legislation, suspension of drug sales through
veterinary centers) in support of liberalization and privatization of veterinary supplies. As a result,
sales outlets opened up by the CA1E or directly by the PCAs or private companies operate
throughout the country in direct competition with each other. The project achieved its objective of
improving input supply by privatizing marketing and establishing private veterinary practices.
Strengthening of Livestock Services
13.        Eight new DNE veterinary stations were to be built, 25 stations rehabilitated (of
which 15 were to include a pharnacy and outlet for feed and supplements), 40 vaccination crushes
repaired or relocated, and eight new crushes built. The project was also to finance vehicles,
equipment and a radio communication network to link the 30 field stations with headquarters. At
project completion, a total of 12 new field stations were built, 17 rehabilitated and 19 new
vaccination crushes constructed. Thus, most physical targets were met.



-4 -
14.        In addition to providing physical facilities, the project was also to strengthen DNE by
providing technical assistance and establishing a range management and stockwater section. These
activities were carried out mostly as planned, although the stockwater section was placed in the
Ministry of Water Resources and Energy to avoid duplication. In addition, the project was to
enhance staff capabilities through local and external (fellowship) training. For local training,
facilities and equipment of the Ecole National de Formation et Vulgarisation Rurale (EA"JI' were
upgraded, staff capabilities enhanced and technical assistance provided. Altogether, 20 persons
were trained for a period of three years, 20 for two months, 55 for one month and 77 in short (3-8
day) seminars. Nevertheless, due to the questionable relevance of some of this training, and the
frequent shuffling of staff between departments, the strengthening of DNE under the project was
achieved only in part.
Establishment of extra-budgetary funding
15.          The BIE was to sell all veterinary drugs and animal feeds at full cost, plus a mark-
up of 15% to avoid unfair competition with the emerging private trade and to generate operating
funds.  This additional percentage was to be deposited in a Livestock Fund (Fonds de
D6veloppement de l'Elevage - EDE) to finance recurrent costs of the DNE field services. For the
same purpose, an import fee of 90/o was to be imposed on all privately imported veterinary products
and the revenue deposited in a Special Treasury Account (STA) also earmarked for DNE field
activities. The FDE never materialized, since the BIE used the funds to support its own operations,
and the STA only generated a total of UM12 million for the project during the 1987-1991 period,
and another UM7 million in 1993, a sum far below expectations. The project did not succeed in
reformiing the financing of public livestock services.
16.        The Production Improvement Fund (Fonds de Developpement de I 'Elevage) was to
provide partial funding (on a grant basis) of mini-projects for which groups of livestock owners
would be willing and able to provide at least 10% of the cost in cash and another 20% in cash or
ldnd. Activities eligible for grant financing included small rural works (slaughter slabs, wells, dams,
etc.), improvement of facilities (dips and crushes), demarcation of grazing areas, range and pasture
improvement, and marketing of basic food items. Nevertheless, FND did not materialize and only
during the last two years of the project were efforts made to help livestock owners design and
prepare proposals. By project's end, 25 mini-projects had been financed under the Norwegian
Trust Fund. Most focused on milk production, and the rest on animal rearing and fattening. Part
of the profit generated by these mini-projects is plowed back into the respective PCA. A spill-over
effect has been noted, as some farmners have started to create their own mini-projects without
government assistance.
17.          To promote forage development by the PCAs, the Government launched a pilot
hay harvesting operation in 1991, and by 1993/94 a total of 200 tons had been collected and sold.
No activities took place in 1994/95 due to delays in equipment purchases. In 1994, two pilot
pastoral perimeters were demarcated and a management system based on rotation was set up.
However, it is still too early to assess the impact of these measures. Although it had to be financed
under a grant and not under the proposed FND, the implementation of this component can be rated
partially satisfactory.



-5-
The Nouakchott Abattoir
18.         The project was to finance the construction, equipment and working capital of a
small abattoir in Nouakchott. Sixty percent of the cost was to be covered by the OPEC Fund and
the remainder by the National Development Fund (FND) (37%) and the Municipality of
Nouakchott (MON) (3%). Construction was supposed to start in early 1987, but long delays in
tendering and bid evaluation led to several postponements. The FND was later closed down and
MON indicated that it would no longer be able to contribute funds. Alternative funding sources
had to be found and AfDB agreed to bridge the gap. The involvement of a second donor further
delayed the evaluation of new bids, which finally took place in late 1994, and construction started in
early 1995. Since the facility has been built and is expected to become operational shortly, the
component has contributed to the achievement of project's objectives, despite its implementation
delays.
Economic Analysis
19.         A ERR of 10% was estimated (but not calculated) at appraisal, assuming that the
project would result in an incremental annual offlake of 7,600 tropical livestock units through (i)
improved knowledge of the livestock subsector; (ii) the preparation of follow-on projects; (iii)
institutional reforms, particularly with respect to financing public livestock services; and (iv)
improved production practices. The project does not in fact appear to have attained such
performance, since it has not achieved items (i) and (iii) and had had only limited impact on items
(ii) and (iv), although no statistical data are available.
C.         Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
Implementation Record
20.         It should be stressed that this was, throughout most of its life, a problem project
which got off to a very slow start. By mid-term (June 1990), only 300/o of the IDA credit had been
disbursed against an SAR target of 75%. This discrepancy was due to delays in procurement,
contract procedures and execution of civil works; frequent changes in project managernent; and
organizational and legislative problems. By that time, it was clear that the project would not
achieve its objectives, but no major adjustment of project design was agreed upon with the
Government.
21.          Progress remained slow and, in view of focusing efforts towards the strengthening
of PCAs, the supervision mission of August 1993 carried out a drastic streamlining of the project
by suspending project support for four out of six project components (studies, input supply,
support of DNE and production development fund) and retaining only two (pastoral associations
and slaughterhouse). In addition, the mission warned the Government that the Credit would be
suspended unless the following conditions were met by the deadlines specified:
(a) nomination of a full-time project director (Oct. 30, 1993);



- 6-
(b)  improvement of financial management (Oct. 30, 1993) to avoid further
embezzlements like those discovered in December 1992;
(c)  preparation of a detailed work program and budget acceptable to IDA
(October 30, 1993);
(d)  identification (by means of hydrogeological surveys) of sites for 33 new
tubewells (January 31, 1994);
(e)  liquidation of BEE (January 31, 1994); and
(f)  suspension of sales of veterinary inputs by Government in the vicinity of PCAs
outlets (January 31, 1994).
22.          The Government fulfilled these conditions in a timely manner, thus avoiding
suspension. Since then, the project has made considerable progress, especially in achieving its
physical targets and training objectives.
23.         Despite the three-year extension, only US$ 5.3 million, or about 700/o of the IDA
credit, was disbursed (see Table 4). The lag in disbursements can be attributed mainly to a reduced
civil works program, but partly also to the significant depreciation of the UM against the US$, with
a resulting reduction of local costs in US$ terms. The Norwegian Grant of US$ 2.2 million was
fully disbursed.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
24.          Project financing was initially based on three international donors (IDA, AIDB and
OPEC Fund) and four different sources of domestic contributions. In 1991, a fourth international
co-financier (Government of Norway) joined the project with grant funds. This multiplicity of
donors slowed the loan approval process, contributing to the time lag of over one and a half years
between negotiations (October 1985) and effectiveness (June 1987). Throughout implementation,
the lack of donor coordination retarded execution, since for each source of funding the Borrower
had to follow different procedures, which in any case were difficult to reconcile with its own
regulations, causing further delays and cost increases.
Factors Subject to Government Control
25.         On the one hand, the Government formulated and enacted the required laws and by-
laws to liberalize veterinary services (including the establishment of private practices and input
sales) and created the necessary legal framework for the restructuring of the PCAs. Both measures
were important and necessary to achieve some of the project's development objectives, and
demonstrated the Government's commitment to the privatization process. On the other hand, the
Government failed to introduce legally enforceable grazing and stockwater rights for PCAs, thus
depriving them of incentives to improve and maintain grazing and stockwater supplies, which was



-7 -
one of the major project objectives. Furthermore, the Government failed to ensure a continuous
flow of counterpart funding, especially for staff transportation in the field, which was problematic
and adversely affected field operations.
26.         Finally, some veterinary stations constructed/rehabilitated  under the project
(including small laboratories and clinics) were taken over by the MDRE and transformed into
offices. This deprived the many areas without private veterinarians of proper veterinary support
and facilities.
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
27.          Until the mid-term review and, to a lesser extent, the restructuring of mid-1993,
project management was haphazard and erratic. This was due in part to the fact that the Director
of DNE was simultaneously appointed as Project Director, and also in part to the lack of continuity
in project management. From 1987 to 1993, the directorate was headed by six different people;
this clearly had a disruptive effect on project activities and caused substantial implementation
delays. Once a full-time Project Director was appointed (as one of the conditions for the lifting of
suspension, para. 21), substantial progress was made.
28.          The initially poor financial control and management also opened the door to
substantial embezzlement (over UM 20 million or US$ 160,000 equivalent), delays in the
submission of audit reports and poor accounting of expenditures vis-a-vis the various donors.
With the appointment of a locally-recruited financial controller in 1993, the situation improved
considerably.
29.          The performance of contractors, suppliers and consultants engaged by DNE was
mixed. Quality problems and/or delays were encountered with the rehabilitation and new
construction of veterinary field stations and crushes. Also, the water supply program suffered from
delays that could mostly be attributed to difficulties experienced by project management in dealing
with Bank procurement procedures. The construction of the abattoir was considerably delayed
(see para. 18). Suppliers of equipment and spare parts generally performed well, although some
difficulties arose over specifications. Consultants' performance, particularly technical assistance,
was not satisfactory. For instance, the resident expatriate financial controller failed to spot
discrepancies, even though the above-mentioned embezzlement of funds occurred while he was in
charge of project accounting. This illustrates the limits of the effectiveness of long-term technical
assistari;e. Some research and survey work, as well as some aspects of the training program, were
not up to satisfactory standards.
D.          Project Sustainability
30.          Regarding the PCAs, it appears that those that have so far been restructured are
likely to continue without further outside financial assistance. Pastoralists are convinced of the
advantages of membership, i.e., access to veteninary inputs and feed, lower water fees,
supplementary funding of mini-projects, rapid access to extension advice, and representation of
their interests at the national level through GNAP. The finances of the PCAs, based on
membership fees (UM 300 p.a.), water fees and input sales, as well as income from mini-projects,



-8 -
are still weak. Membership numbers are rising, however, and should enhance the PCAs' financial
viability.
31.          The mini-projects appear sustainable, especially those dealing with milk production,
as they have been replicated by individual farmers without outside financial assistance. For other
operations, such as pasture development and hay harvesting, it is too early to assess their
sustainability, although there are serious doubts about hay harvesting, since the market price of hay
does not include the depreciation of equipment required for mechanical harvesting.
E.          Bank Performance
32.         A total of 15 missions were necessary to advance the project from the first IEPS in
1981 to start-up in 1987. This reflects the difficulties encountered, particularly with the structural
reform process to be introduced by the project. Between effectiveness and project closing, the
Bank fielded 16 supervision missions in 1990 and a restructuring mission in 1993. With the
exception of a few missions (e.g. mid-term review in 1990 and the restructuring missions in 1993),
supervision missions (16 in 7 and a half years) consisted mainly of the successive task managers in
charge, who were all livestock experts, with little or no assistance from other specialists. This
proved disadvantageous, especially in the early stages, as some problems that could have been
corrected then without delaying the project were either glossed over or not properly identified,
particularly with regard to financial, managerial and legal issues. Multi-disciplinary supervision
would have been more appropriate.
33.          The supervision missions should have realized early on that the creation of PCAs
covering almost the entire population of the various project areas was not effective. It was only in
1993, with the implementation of the new Cooperative Law, that the situation began to be rectified.
As early as 1989, the Bank could have taken much more decisive steps to get the project back on
track, especially as regards implementation of the physical infrastructure program (wells, veterinary
field stations, abattoir), which was by then already considerably behind schedule.
F.          Borrower Performance
34.          Generally, the Borrower's performance during project implementation was weak.
Project management was extremely erratic, except for the last two years. Financial control and
audits were generally poor and the Government failed to establish a sound base for counterpart
financing. The Borrower's performance forced the Bank to issue a warning of credit suspension in
1993, which seems to have had the desired effect of getting the project moving. The Borrower
fulfilled the conditions set by the Bank for avoiding suspension in a timely manner, and project
implementation improved considerably thereafter.
G.          Assessment of Outcome
35.          The project achieved most of its targets in terms of physical infrastructure and
training. Nevertheless, the water supply component fell short of completion, and this required
cancellation of US$ 2.3 million of the Credit. The project has failed to establish a sound approach
and basis for the future development of the sector, including the financing of public livestock



- 9 -
services. In terms of policy and institutional reform, its main success was the liberalization of
livestock support services, including the establishment of private veterinarians and the competitive
sale of veterinary inputs. Although efforts to spur community management and improvement of
grazing areas by providing the necessary legal framework did not succeed, they paved the way for
two ongoing pastoral pilot perimeters in Timbedra and Tintane.
36.         Concerning the core activity, i.e., the establishment of PCAs, those that underwent
restructuring have demonstrated an adequate level of organization, shared objectives and active
beneficiary participation.  Together with their umbrella organization, (GNAP), they appear
sustainable and could serve as a basis for future rural development initiatives. However, more new
PCAs are needed in order to achieve the long-term project objective of nationwide maintenance
and improvement of grazing areas under legally ensured control.
37.         The project was expected to increase livestock production by making improved
services and inputs available to livestock owners. Unfortunately, no base-line survey was carried
out and no system was set up to monitor and evaluate the project's impact on such key parameters
as animal production and health, or herders' income. It is therefore impossible to assess the
project's success in achieving this objective. At appraisal, no economic analysis was carried out
It was asserted that an incremental annual production of 8,000 TLUs over an assumed project life
of 20 years would result in an ERR of 14%. The absence of any actual production figures.
however, would make such a calculation purely speculative.
38.          The severe delays in implementation left very little time to prove the usefulness of
activities supported by the project. The establishment of PCAs has been termed a "pilot activity", a
term implying the testing of the approach and future application if it is found viable.  Similarly,
most of the study and survey program was meant to serve as a basis for future interventions. In
both these core activities, the project achieved only limited success. The study and survey program
did not achieve its objective of creating a data and information base strong enough to be used for
the formulation of development policy or for planning future interventions. Despite the selective
achievements, the overall outcome of the project must be rated as unsatisfactory.
H.          Future Operation
39.          The continuation of the livestock program will be mostly ensured by the Rainfed
Natural Resource Management Project (RNRM), to be appraised in FY97. This project is intended
to build on the successful elements of the Livestock II project, including  (i) provision ot
encouragement to effective producers' groups; (ii) establishment of community-managed services
(wells, pharmacies); and (iii) follow-up activities initiated under the Livestock II project (forage
harvesting, rangeland management). At the same time, the RNRM project would incorporate the
lessons learned from this livestock project by: (i) allocating most of the credit proceeds to field
investments rather than to operating costs of Government services, (ii) allocating the project staff to
the regional and local levels, rather than to ministry headquarters in Nouakchott; (iii) dealing
simultaneously with all natural resources (rainfed agricu]ture, fuelwood management, livestock)
rather than focusing on livestock production; and (iv) operating within a Comprehensive Sectoral
Program approach dealing with unified agricultural research and extension services, rather that
having the project establish its own support services.



- 10-
L           Key Lessons Learned
40.          The experience gained under the implementation of this project could be
summarized with the following three key lessons:
(a)    Potential for beneficiazy participation: Although the project did only deliver part
of the support it was supposed to provide to rural communities, the degree to
which the Pastoral Community Association component succeeded, as evidenced
by the much greater number (and larger size) of associations established than
planned at appraisal, shows that rural communities have a considerable capacity to
organize and make a commitment to be involved in decision-making. This is
promising for the future, in particular in the implementation of the follow-on
Rainfed Natural Resources Management Project.
(b)    Minimizing complexity and poor implementation: Project design should always be
kept simple: (i) the number of components should remain small; (ii) procedures
should be harmonized when multiple donors are involved, and (iii) innovative
measures should be carried out on a case-by-case pilot basis. Furthermore, when
problems appear during implementation, the tool of project restructuring should be
used to streamline project design and make it even simpler (see para. 21).
(c)    Designing an effective monitoring system for supervision: Whatever the nature of
the operation (pilot or not), or its time frame, a comprehensive set of indicators
related directly to the achievement of the project's development objectives should
be established and monitored against performance, both during implementation (to
correct strategies) and ex post (to be able to apply the experience in the future). In
addition, the supervision mission skills mix should reflect the needs of the project,
and a single task manager should not be expected to be an expert on everything.

The SAR had envisaged the execution of studies to enhance the knowledge of livestock production systems
in Mauritania. These studies were to include a survey of a sample of various livestock production systems
in order to identify constraints, studies on livestock ownership, animal health and production, livestock
management practices and a pathology survey.
In order to execute these studies. funds were provided for technical assistance, vehicles, etc. and also for
contracts to be carried out by the Centre National d'Elevage at the Recherche Veterinaire (CNERV) and the
Agricultural Statistics Unit of the MDR.  In addition, hydrological studies were to be undertaken to
determine the location of new tubewells.
Over 30 studies were carried out. These studies also to the identification of the sites for the tubewells and
the preparation of the legislation for the privatization of veterinary services.

Second projet d'elevage (Cr. 1658 MAU)
Mission de pr6paration du rapport d'achEvement de la mise enr. auvrc
AIDE - MEMOiRE
A. INTRODUCTION
1.         Le present aide memoire a t realise par une mission du FAOICP' qui a visite la
Mauritanie du 11 au 21 octobre 1995 dans le cadre de la pr6paration du Rapport d'achevement
de la mise en oeuvre du projet 'Elevage I1. La principale contre-partie institutionnelle de la
mission a ete la Direction du Developpement des Ressources Agricoles et Pastorales (DRAP).
Des visites de terrain ont ete entreprises dans deux Associations Cooperatives Pastorales (Rosso
Nord et Rosso Est) mises en place dans le cadre du projet et des discussions ont e  menees avec
les presidents et principaux responsables de ces deux associations. La mission adresse ses plus
vifs remerciements a toutes les personnes qui ont apporte leur appui et en particulier les
Associations Pastorales de Rosso Est et Rosso Ouest pour leur accueil chaleureux ainsi que le
Docteur Mouktar Fall, Directeur du Projet "Elevage 11" et ses collaborateurs pour leur accueil
et leur disponibilite.
B. HISTORIQUE ET OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
2.         Le projet "Elevage II" a ete identifie en decembre 1979 et forrnul par une equipe
de consultants en 1982. La requete de financement a ete adressee par les autorites mauritaniennes
en juin 1983 et la pre-evaluation par la Banque Mondiale s'est deroulee en octobre 1983.
L'originalite de certains composants du projet, notamment la creation d'Associations
Cooperatives Pastorales, la fourniture d' intrants et l'introduction de la prise en charge des couts
de vaccination par les beneficiaires a conduit a une certaine prudence dans la preparation du
projet afin de permettre une bonne comprehension et acceptation de la strategie du projet. Le
rapport d'evaluation a ete elabore en janvier 1986. Le projet a ete presente au Conseil
d'Adininistration de l'IDA le 4 fevrier 1986 et signe le 24 avril 1986. Le projet est entre en
vigueur le 30 juin 1987. L'achbvement du projet 6tait prevue pour le 31 decembre 1991 et la
date de cloture du credit pour le 30 juin 1992.
3.         Le projet avait pour objectifs de freiner la deterioration des zones de piturage et
d'augmenter la productivite du secteur de l'elevage en responsabilisant les groupes d'eleveurs
dans la gestion de leurs zones de paturages, en am6liorant les services de l'elevage et la
disponibilite en intrants et en renforqant la connaissanoe des syst6mes de production afin de
La mission etait composee de MM. H. Trupke, Economiste, Chef de mission et M. Moens,
Ingenieur agronoine/zootechnicien.

permettre I'elaboration d'une politique de d6veloppement de 1'61evage et la formulation d'actions
futures. Afin de rialiser ces objectifs, le projet comprenait six composantes (i) une composante
pilote de creation d'Associations Coopdratives Pastomales (ACP); (1I l'tetude et le suivi des
systemes de production et la preparation de projets de developpement; (iii) la distribution et la
vente d'intrants aux 6leveurs; (iv) le renforcement des services de l'6levage; (v) la cr6ation d'un
Fonds de Developpement de I'Elevage (FDE) et; (vi) la construction d'un nouvel abattoir a
Nouakchott.
4.         Le cout total initial du projet etait estimr  a US$ 18.1 millions repartis entre l'IDA
(US$ 7,6 millions), le FAD (US$ 6,3 millions), I',PEC (US$ 2,0 millions). La contrepartie
gouvernementale etait estimee a US$ 2.2 millions.
5.         Le projet a connu un demarrage tres lent et a l'occasion de la revue a mi-parcours
de juin 1990 devant les faibles performances du projet, il a e  decide un recentrage des activites
du projet. C'est ainsi que les activites du projet ont ete concentrees (i) sur la poursuite des
creations d' ACP, incluant la reconnaissance des droits pastoraux, I'hydraulique pastorale, les
operations pilotes (mini-projets, p6rim&tres pastoraux pilotes, operations fauche, distribution de
foumitures zootechniques), I'assistance technique, la formation et la vulgarisation ainsi que (ii)
la construction de l'abattoir de Nouakchott.
6.         Afin de permettre la realisation de ces objectifs revises, le Gouvernement a sollicit6
une extension du projet pour une duree de trois annees (usqu'au 31 decembre 1994). Ce;e
extension a et approuvee par la Banque Mondiale. Au meme moment il a et6 estimi que les
fonds du projet ne serait pas suffisant pour permettre 1'expansion du programme ACP prevue.
Afin de pallier A ce manque de financement, wu  4ssisahce a- e   ollicitie aliprts du
Gouvernement Norvegien qui a accorde un don de 14 millions de couronnes (6quivalent a USS
2,27 millions/1990). Les autres couts initiaux du projet restant inchanges.
C. MISE EN OEUVRE, EXPtRIENCES ET RESULTATS
7.         Concernant les Associations Coopmratives Pastorales il etait pr6vu la creation de
15 ACP dont 5 devaient etre cre6es apres 2 ans et 1/2 d'activites du projet. Au moment de la
revue a mi-parcours, 17 ACP avaient ete creees et 101 autres identifiees. La phase d'extension
du projet prevoyait la generalisation des ACP a toute I'6tendue du territoire national par
l'etablissement des 101 ACP identifiees au cours de la premiere phase et le renforcement des
operations des 17 deja existantes. Au cours de la mise en oeuvre de la phase d'extension il est
bien vite apparu que cette generalisation etait trop rapide et que le suivi n6cessaire aux ACP ne
pourrait pas &tre assure par les services de l'elevage. n a donc etE decide de se limiter a 39 ACP
y corppris les 17 deja crMes au cours de la premierc phase. Au vu de 1'exp6rience acquise avec
ces 39 ACP et suite a la restructuration du Ministere du Developpement Rural, un programme
de redynamisation de ces ACP a 6t6 entamr pour mieux cibler les activitEs. Cette restructuration
encore en cours a egalement introduit le paiement obligatoire d'une cotisation pour etre membre
assurant ainsi l'adh6sion d'eleveurs reellement int6resses.

8.         Fourniture d'intmnts: Le rapport d'evaluation projet prevoyait une privatisation
progressive de l'approvisionnement en intrants d'elevage. A cette fin le projet a mis en place le
Bureau des Intrants de l'Elevage (BIE) charg6 de l'achat et de la distribution de medicaments
a travers les centres veterinaires de la DNE. Le BIE avait l'obligation de vendre ces intrants
avec une marge beneficiaire de 15 % destinee a alimenter un Fonds de D6veloppement de
Il'Eevage (EDE). Ce fonds n'a jamais 6te mat6rialise. Parallelement, il 6tait pr6vu le
prelevement d'une taxe de 9% sur les importations prives de medicaments pour alimenter un
compte special du tresor qui a effectivement g6n6re pour le projet au cours de la periode 1987-
1991 un montant total de UM 12 millions et autre UM 7 millions en 1993. Le FDE et le compte
special du tr6sor devait permettre le financement des coOts d'operation de terrain de la Direction
Nationale de l'Elevage mais contrairement aux previsions du SAR les versements r6alisEs ont
ete tres faibles et ont porte prejudice a la rdalisation des activites du projet dependantes de ce
financement.
9.         Initialement la BIE utilisait les centres vEteinaires de la DNE pour la distribution
et la vente des produits mais il etait prevu dans le cadre du projet la mise en place de pharmacies
veterinaires independantes dans chacune des 15 ACP afin de rendre les produits directement
disponibles aupres les eleveurs. En raison des couts excessifs il a ete decide de n'installer au sein
des ACP que des dep6ts de medicaments courants non toxiques. Au moment de la revue a mi-
parcours 13 de ces depots etaient installes au sein des ACP. Avec l'assistance du Fonds
Norvegiens 21 autres depots ont ete installes au cours de la seconde phase du projet, portant
ainsi le nombre total a 34. La vente des medicaments par les centres veterinaires des zohes
concernees a ete arretee.
10.       Au vu des performances relativement faibles dans la gestion du B1E (structure p#a-
etatique) et afin de renforcer le processus de privatisation des intrants de l'elevage il a WtE
decide de liquider le BIE au profit d'une societe mixte i.e. Ia Centrale d'Approvisionnement des
Intrants de l'Elevage (CAIE) qui fut creee en juin 1994 et comprend comme societaires l'Etat
et la majorite des ACP.
11.       Hydraulique pastorale: Afin de satisfaire les besoins en eau du cheptel et des
populations, 13 nouveaux puits devaient etre construits par le projet et 60 rehabilites. A la revue
a mi-parcours ces chiffres ont ete portes a 17 pour les nouveaux puits et 68 pour les
rehabilitations. A l'issue du projet 13 nouveaux puits ont ete realises et 68 rehabilites. Les quatre
puits declares negatifs lors des premieres Etudes ont fait l'objet d'un avenant pour la construction
dans d'autres sites choisis par les ACP concernees. Ces points d'eau sont geres par les ACP et
l'eau est revendue au prix du marche.
12.       Mini-projets et Fonds de roulement: Le rapport d'evaluation pr6voyait la crEation
d'un Fonds pour l'Am6lioration de I'tlevage (FAP) destine au financement de mini-projets
inities par les ACP. A la revue a mi-parcours, 13 fonds de roulement pour l'achat de
medicaments veterinaires avaient 6te etablis et aucun mini-projet n'avait ete finance. Le Fonds
de Developpement de l'tlevage a ete suspendu en application des principes d'orthodoxie
financiere. Apres la restructuration du projet et grace au fonds Norvegiens obtenu, les efforts
se sont concentres sur la viabilisation des ACP notamment par la poursuite de la mise en place



-21 -                                Annex A
Page 4 of 7
des fonds de roulement ct des mini-projets: 34 des 39 ACP ont bEn6ficid d'un fonds de
roulement pour V'achat de medicaments veterinaires (voir paragraphe 9) et 25 mini-projets ont
ete financEs. La plupart des mini-projets finances ont concerne la production laiiere et dans une
moindre mesure 1'embouche.
13.       Operation fauche: Initiee par le projet en 1991 sur financement de l'ltat, cette
operation visait a renforcer la disponibilite en fourrage pendant les periodes de soudure et la
mise en valeur de paturages inexploites. Cette operation pilote a concerne 6 ACP et etait bas6e
sur la fauche mecanique du foin. Elle a produit au cours de sa derniere campagne (93/94) 201
tonnes de fourrage vendu a un prix de base n'incluant pas I'amortissement des equipements.
14.       Pdrinitres Pastoraux: II etait egalement prevu que le FAP soit utilise par les ACP
dans le cadre d'activitds d'amelioration de la gestion des paturages. Cet aspect a ete neglige par
le projet jusqu'a la mise en place de deux perimetres pastoraux en 1994 qui se sont limites a une
simple gestion de la rotation des paturages sans actions specifiques d'amelioration des patures.
15.       Renforcement des services de I'dlevage: Ce volet prevoyait la construction de 8
nouveaux centres v6terinaires et la rehabilitation de 25, la rehabilitation (ou le deplacement) de
40 parcs de vaccination, le financement de vehicules, equipements et fonctionnement et la mise
en place d'un systame de communication radio. Ces investissements etaient accompagnes par un
volet de formation du personnel veterinaire et d'encadrement et de la reorganisation du syst&ne
de financement des operations basde sur la recuperation des codts. En juillet 1991, mi Je
programme de construction/rehabilitation des centres veterinaires ni celui des parcs de
vaccination n'avaient ete entame. Le systeme de communication radio avait dte installU et les
vdhicules, c  emes at iima avaiest Ae acheo6s pour la #p iedesidd6r6  lTmUt la
seconde phase du projet 12 centres veterinaires ont ete construits, 17 rehabilit6s et 19 parcs de
vaccination ont ete construits. ILe programme de formation a ete mis en oeuvre conformement
au SAR. La reorganisation du systeme de financement des services de l'elevage n'a pas reussi:
le Fonds de Developpement de I'tlevage n'a en effet jamais ete operationnel (voir paragraphe
8).
16.       Etudes et Enqugtes: Le projet a ete formule comme projet pilote car la
connaissance du secteur de 1'elevage y compris les aspects socio-pastoraux Etait trts limitee. Le
projet a donc prevu un financement pour la realisation des etudes necessaires et le suivi des
ACP creees. Au total 30 etudes et enquetes de suivi ont ete realisees.
D. ANALYSE DES RtSULTATS ET DURABILITt
17.       Comme indique prEc6demment le projet a connu un dEmarrage tres lent ct en juin
1990 seulement 40% des decaissements prevus sur financement IDA etaient realises. Parmi les
facteurs qui ont contribue I ce retard de mise en oeuvre on peut citer:
La meconnaissance du secteur de l'elevage au moment de l'identification du
projet qui a conduit i un projet trop ambitieux et complexe pour lequel un



Annex A
Page 5 of 7
-22-
suivi administratif, financier et technique ctait difficile a realiscr. Le
projet a ainsi plus 6te administrd que mis en execution et la deficience
d'un systeme de suivi efficace s'est fait cruellement rcssentir.
Des retards dans l'achat des equipements, dans la passation des marche.s
et dans 1'execution des infrastructures rurales dus a une difficulte de
comprehension de procedures parfois complexes et differentes selon les
organismes.
La duplicite de fonction entre le Directeur de la Direction Nationale de
I'tlevage et le Directeur du projet qui a entraine une instabilite au sein
de la Direction (6 Directeurs diff6rents au cours de la duree de vie du
projet).
Des aspects institutionnels et 1lgislatifs difficiles a mettre en place.
La creation des ACP a plus correspondu a des sollicitations exterieures
qu'a une reelle volonte des populations et s'est traduit par des objectifs
imprecis, mal cibles et par un manque d'activit6s au niveau local.
18.        Apres la revue a mi-parcours il est devenu evident que le projet n'avait guere
acheve ses objectifs et la mission a recommande un recentrage des objectifs et une extension
de trois ann6es. Malgre ce recentrage les progres sont restes trks lent. Des lors, pour
accelerer le processus la mission de supervision d'aout 1993 a averti le gouvernement qu'une-
cloture du credit etait imminente et a impose des conditions de non suspension qui devait etrc
remplies pour le 31 janvier 1994 au plus tard. La seconde phase du projet n'a pu ainsit
reellement demarrer qu'apres le mois d'aout 1993. Cette situation est refletee 4galement_par
les niveaux de d6caisseme=t qui se sont acccl&es aprcs cene date. ttant donne que
seulement deux ann&es se sont deroulees depuis, il a dt6 pratiquement impossible a la mission
ICR de pouvoir juger au stade actuel de l'impact et de la durabilitd des investissements
r6alisis au cours du projet. Ndanmoins un certain nombre d'observations provisoires ont pu
etre degagees.
19.        Concernant les ACP, le schema organisationnel mis en place par le projet ainsi
que son experience dans la promotion des organisations socio-professionnelles pourra servir
de cadre institutionnel a d'autres projets de ddveloppement rural notamment pour
l'introduction et la diffusion de nouvelles approches ou technologies. Sa structure nationale,
le Groupement National des Associations Pastorales (GNAP), represente, malgre un risque
de centralisation trop eloignee des adherents et la concurrence d'organisations similaires, une
organisation professionnelle representative. La mise en place des ACP a eu un effet de
d6monstration appreciable et un certain nombre d'dleveurs sont maintenant convaincus des
avantages quc cc type d'organisation peut apporter. 11 y a donc de bonnes chances que sans
assistance financiere ext&ieure les ACP continueront d'exister et de progresser. Neanmoins,
la rapidite d'expansion de ces organisations se fera a un rythme bien inferieur a celui qui
serait ralis,e si unc assistance extdrieure .tait apport6e. Les ACP auront UL'avenir encore
besoin d'une assistance dtroite de la part des services du Gouvernement Mauritanien
notamment dans les domaines de la gestion quotidienne et la surveillance sanitaire des
animaux. I1 est peu probable que les cadres d'encadrement mis en place par le projet auprbs
des ACP puissent a court terme etre pris en charge par ces dernieres.
20.        Concernant les mini-projets, bien que le nombre de bdnWficiaires directs par
ACP soit relativement restreint, certaines operations rdalises, notamment la production



Annex A
- 23 -                                Page 6 of 7
laitiere, ont dt# r6pUiqu6es par des eleveurs individuels sans financement exterieur. Cette
tendance a  tre copi6 pernet de penser que leur durabilite est assurke. Les inforrnations
disponibles quant aux autres technologies mises en oeuvre (opdration fauche et perimetres
pastoraux) restent encore trop fragmentaires et localisees pour prejuger de la durabilite de
ces expriences.
21.        Concernant la distribution des intrants veterinaires les mesaventures enregistrees
(medicaments invendus, perimes) ont ete assimilees et la viabilite des fonds de roulement mis
en place parait acquise si un suivi technique et des conseils de gestion peuvent etre assures
par les services du MDRE. Cette viabilite reste n6apmoins fort dependante de la possibilite
d'obtenir au scin de l'ACP un diagnostic medical et une prescription adequate du medicament
a administrer. Elle est egalement conditionnee par le bon fonctionnement de la CAIE et la
future participation majoritaire des ACP au sein de cette societe pourrait etre un element
determinant de sa viabilite economique. Le projet a atteint son objectif d'e1iminer les
distorsions des prix des produits veterinaires. A l'issue du projet on observe sur toute
l'etendue du territoire national des points de vente de medicaments ouverts aussi bien par la
CAIE que par les ACP ou des prives. Ces differents points de vente operent dans un climat
concurrentiel profitable aux eleveurs.
22.        Les mesures prises dans le cadre du renforcement des services de l'elevage
risquent d'etre diluees par la reorganisation du MDR de 1993 basee notamment sur une-
reunification des services de vulgarisation de 1'elevage et de l'agriculture. Les centres
veterinaires crees ou ameliores ne sont plus a l'entiere disposition des services de l'dlevage.
Ils sont soit partages avec d'autres services soit entierement utilisds par les services'
administratifs. Le personnel forink dans le cadre du prioj  a dgaIen=  &A ingiri daans les
structures communes et ne peut plus se concentrer uniquement sur les aspects elevage. Les
soins veterinaires ont egalement ete affectes par cette restructuration. Les mrndecins ne se
trouvent plus sous la responsabilite directe des services de production/sante animale de la
DNE mais sous la supervision du MDRE. Pour compenser, une legislation autorisant la
medecine veterinaire privee a ete mise en place mais les effets pratiques de cette legislation
sont encore faibles.
23.        Les etudes et enquetes sociologiques r6alisdes ont permis d'ajuster les objectifs
pour la seconde phase du projet. Ces etudes ont egalement permis l'identification des lieux
d'installation des points d'eau. L'etude sur le code de l'elevage a cree la base pour mettre
en place la legislation sur la privatisation des services v6t6rinaires. Malgre le nombre
d'etudes entreprises les informations concernant le troupeau mauritanien restent faibles et
imprecises et ne permettent pas l'elaboration d'une politique precise de production et de
com mercialisation.
24.        Concernant l'abattoir de Nouakchott, sa mise en operation ne sera pas effective
avant la fin de l'annee 1995. Aucun jugement quant a la viabilite de l'investissement ne peut
etre degage.
25.        Comparativement au cout total du projet de USS 18,1 millions initialement
prevu, les coOts ont ete provisoirement reestimes S-US$ 11 millions. Des US$ 7,6 millions
du credit IDA, un total de US$ 5,3 millions a ete d6caiss6 a la date du 30 septembre 1995.
Ce montant inclus le remboursement en juin 1987 du PPF de US$ 0,4 millions. Le faible
taux de decaissement peut principalement etre attribue a la forte reduction du programme de

construction des infrastructures et, dans une moindre mesure, h la d6valuation de l'ouguiyas
par rapport au dollar amrricain qui a conduit a une reduction des coOts locaux exprimes en
dollars. Les coots ci-dessus mentionnes n'incluent pas le don norvegien de USS 2,2 millions
qui a dth presque entiFrement decaisse.
E. SUITE A DONNER
25.       La mission preparera un rapport de post- valuatzon selon les directives de la
Banque Mondiale qui sera soumis au Gouvernement, et a la Banque. Ces directives stipulent
que l'Emprunteur doit contribuer au rapport en elaborant son propre rapport d'evaluation
finale du projet pour etre annexe au rapport de post-evaluation..

FINAL EVALUATION REPORT
1. Assessment and explanation of evaluation
1.1. Assessment and evaluation of objectives
a) Recapitulation of project objectives
- Increase knowledge and understanding of the livestock subsector and bring about
improvement in resource management by establishing pastoral associations;
- Draw up a development plan and prepare follow-on projects in the livestock subsector;
- Carry out institutional and structural reform of outreach services, particularly as regards
the funding of livestock services;
- Increase productivity by providing herders with improved services and inputs.
b) Assessment and evaluation
- The first objective sums up in one sentence the project's main activities, especially since
its revamping in 1991-1992. It is a very ambitious objective, and one which could only be
partially achieved.
Knowledge and understanding of the subsector have been deepened by the project's
managers, through successive missions by a consulting sociologist and through studies of
livestock and meat marketing financed under the credit. These studies were
complemented by an overall study of the subsector financed by two TCPs from the
UNDP/FAO. Unfortunately, the results of surveys of production parameters undertaken
under the project were not available at the time the studies were conducted.
Consequently, the studies could only be based on estimates of herd numbers and
composition. A livestock census remains to be done.
In terms of support to the association movement, the objective is in line with the policy of
progressive government disengagement from certain areas of the productive sector in
order to leave the field open for socioprofessional organizations. The project has made it
possible to create a certain social dynamic among herders, who now express a certain
willingness to unite and assume responsibility for their own activities. However, in order
to ground its interventions, the Government needs cooperatives that really fit in with the
goal of rural development. In order for a cooperative to be registered as such, the
economic and financial evaluation of its work program must point to the future
cooperative's profitability. This is not the case with all pastoral organizations. The
preoccupation with sociological matters and with the distribution of veterinary medicines



- 26 -                             Annex B
Page 2 of 6
at the time a group is created has obscured the issue of the long-term profitability of the
pastoral associations that are being created. Aside from those that have been the
beneficiaries of mini-projects, the PAs do not have a program that provides them with
sufficient income to do away with the policy of always asking their members for
contributions.
The emergence of leaders at the local and national levels is a positive outcome of the
project. Nevertheless, these leaders and their offices suffer from a lack of resources other
than their members' dues.
Rehabilitation of natural resources has actually occurred on only two pilot perimeters and
only over the past two years. It is still too early to early to draw any conclusions from this
experience. However, the initial positive results indicate that the methodology is
appropriate, that beneficiaries have understood it and that they are now applying it on their
own.
- The second, more realistic, objective has been achieved.
A subsectoral policy has been clearly defined, and the project has submitted the text
summarizing the policy's broad outlines to the interministerial committee in charge of
approving it.
The project's managers helped prepare the Natural Resource Management Project for the
Rainfed Zone (which is a pastoral zone par excellence). The pastoral associations are in
the process of evolving in an effort to tackle the various problems they find in their
territories. Unfortunately, the PGRNP has not taken the PAs sufficiently into account and
is planning to entrust the management of future credits to rural communities (communes
rurales).
- The third objective has not yielded the hoped-for results.
Livestock owners are indeed paying a greater share of their animals' health care costs, and
this is in line with the philosophy behind the third objective. But too few project activities
were planned with a view to promoting the marketing of under-exploited products, such
as milk, leather and hides. Consequently, herders' immediate incomes may actually have
diminished overall.
The privatization of animal health services is well underway. Input supply is handled by a
firm of which the PAs are shareholders. Distribution at the unit level is done through
pastoral pharmacies. The project prepared the legal text (Code de l'Elevage) that
provides the legislative framework needed to set up a sustainable public veterinary health
system.
The costs of services to herders provided by the Government are now integrated into the
Agricultural Services Project (PSA), and are lumped in with the costs of other services. It



- 27 -                           Annex B
Page 3 of 6
is difficult to assert that costs are lower than previously. On the other hand, it is clear that
the PSA has deprived the project of its supervisory staff and changed its approach (which
was initially participatory). Moreover, the restructuring of the MDRE in connection with
the implementation of the PSA has caused a virtual stoppage of the routine chores of
public veterinary health (e.g., monitoring and eradication of contagious diseases,
inspection of meat and animal products intended for human consumption, monitoring of
livestock health in markets and at the borders, early warning in the event of a disease
outbreak, strict application of disease prevention measures, etc.)
- The fourth objective assumes that an improvement in marketing can be brought about
through a subsectoral approach to development, and project activities did not factor in this
approach.
However, the project made it possible to provide herders with inputs, and especially with
veterinary medicines. The "livestock inputs" revolving funds of the PAs are operational
and several associations have managed to come up with the funds necessary to become
stockholders of the CAIE (Centrale d'Approvisionnement en intrants d'elevage).
The mini-projects have spurred some initial attempts at livestock fattening and the
marketing of milk. These successful experiences are now being replicated by other
herders out of their own finances.
These two components have had very positive results, since they have allowed for the
intensification of production and have provided the PAs with new financial resources.
1.2. Assessment and evaluation of the institutional set-up
The project was designed to be implemented by a highly individualized institution (such as
the former Direction de l 'elevage), which would be in charge of all subsectoral functions.
The restructuring of the MDRE divided the ministry's responsibilities among five
directorates (DRAP, DRFV, CNERV, DEAR and Hydraulics) and thirteen delegations.
The disappearance of the vertical and hierarchical structure of the old Direction de
l'elevage, which provided a framework for the project, has made it difficult to monitor and
control operations that are widely scattered in the field. The project has made it possible
to create a national herders' association, but it has not sufficiently integrated this new
entity into the management process. The national association has been involved only in
the management of livestock inputs. This Groupement national des associations
pastorales has received no direct aid under the credit. It could have been more deeply
involved in the monitoring of project management, but the institutional set-up of the
project did not foresee this.
In the absence of any real clout on the part of beneficiaries, the project has been subject to
intense pressures. These pressures have caused a gradual loss of resources initially
earmarked for activities on behalf of the targeted populations.

1.3. Assessment and evaluation of implementation and of experience acquired
Project implementation was hindered by excessively frequent changes of project director.
These personnel movements were always accompanied by a great loss of information and
of sector-specific experience acquired by each individual.
Various components suffered from these changes, and considerable delays developed,
especially in undertakings that were the most complex to launch, since their
implementation depended on the involvement of directorates and services that were now
external to the MDRE (pastoral hydraulics, construction of the Nouakchott abattoir,
animal health infrastructures, etc.).
The improved quality of services rendered to herders was achieved by improving
extension agents' technical expertise through seminars and training abroad. The
restructuring of the Ministry has nevertheless disrupted the orderly program of using
acquired skills; staffers trained for specific tasks now find themselves in an extension
system different from the one that was envisaged for the project. The participatory
approach, which called for the training of grassroots outreach personnel, had to be
abandoned, leaving 20 associations without trained personnel.
The different types of training received, the project's achievements and the preparation of
the follow-on project have given the current project team solid experience in the following
areas:
- Participatory approach to rural development;
- Planning of development and training;
- Holistic management of agro-pastoral resources,
- Monitoring of livestock diseases;
- Socioprofessional organization of herders;
- Accelerated method of participatory planning.
2. Borrower's Performance
The Borrower did not perform well, despite remarkable efforts to meet its commitments.
The original closing date of June 30, 1992 had to be extended to June 30, 1995 after a
reallocation of IDA funds. This three-year extension was not enough to allow the
Borrower to carry out all the activities budgeted.
Among the factors that explain this poor performance, in addition to those mentioned in
the preceding paragraphs, one can cite the following:
- The delay in credit effectiveness caused by Government's difficulty in meeting conditions
to which it had agreed at negotiations;
- An overly ambitious program that did not take field realities into account;



-29 -                            Annex B
Page 5 of 6
- Administrative difficulties with procurement;
- Financial management problems prior to the mid-term review mission;
- The institutional problem with the PAs, which could not obtain usufructuary rights to the
territories under their jurisdiction, although such rights are vital to any long-term program
of natural resource management;
- Restructuring of the MDRE and the introduction of the PSA towards the end of the
implementation period.
3. Performance of the World Bank and other co-financiers
Among the factors that hampered project execution, one can also cite the following:
- An inadequate number of joint missions by co-financiers;
- Delays in payouts by certain co-financiers have caused the type of cash-flow problems
that are common to all types of financing;
- Suspensions of disbursements, which required that the project suspend its activities and
then start over from scratch;
- Lack of support for the project's management in getting the Government to
acknowledge the need for certain reforms (in particular, the application of the land law to
the pastoral zone);
- The absence of recommendations, at the time of supervision missions, concerning
greater involvement of community leaders in the monitoring of credit management;
- A certain lack of consistency in the preparation of the follow-on project. The Livestock
II project has devoted a lot of time and resources to the creation of Pastoral Associations,
which now cover the entire zone of intervention targeted by the PGRNP. These PAs need
programs for their continued existence and development. The FAO/CP team did not take
these accomplishments and needs sufficiently into account. Its institutional package, while
it does not totally ignore the PAs, does not consider them to be the entities best qualified
to manage natural resources in the rainfed zone, even though they are the only ones that
are very familiar with nomads and transhumants and that are integrating these populations
into their approach.

4. Conclusion
The Livestock II project, which was launched by political decision-makers in close
collaboration with donors in order to revive the livestock subsector, has numerous
accomplishments to its credit: organization of herders, heightened awareness of their role
in development, improvement of goods and services. The project also made a start at
deepening knowledge of the subsector. During its implementation, it also highlighted
certain issues that had been obscure at the time that objectives and the means necessary to
attain them were being defined. These issues turned out to be mainly economic in nature.
In the course of its implementation, the project suffered from certain performance
shortcomings (e.g., in the areas of management, monitoring of financial and institutional
procedures, etc.) that hindered the achievement of its objectives.
As implementation draws to a close, it is apparent that there is a need to consolidate the
project's achievements, especially as regards the skills and social organization of herders.
Herders organizations created under the project can be important bases around which to
organize community involvement and the acceptance of responsibility for rational
management of natural resources.
Lessons must be learned from the project's weaknesses (in the areas of institution-
building, management, outreach, functionality of socioprofessional organizations,
monitoring/evaluation, etc.) in order to ensure the continuation of development activities
by and for rural communities.

Y.R.: Lettre du 15 avril 1996
Objet: Rapport dc fin d'cxdcution diu projet 'd-'ecvagc II'
J'ai .'honneur d'accuscr reception du rapport d'aclhtvement du projet 'Elesvge 11'
qui retrace bien les pdripdties de la mise en oeuvrc du credit
Jc note avec satisfaction quc la plupart des objectifs rdvisEs ont dtd artein,
malgrd un ddmarrage tardif du projet en aott 1993.
Dans cc rapport, trois conclusions retiennent particulierement mon attentiolL
l.lles font l'objet des commentaircs et suggestions ci-apr&s:
1. 'Les associations coopEratives pastorales (ACP) et 1eur groupement national (ONAP)
constituent le rdsultat Ic plus durable du projet.
Je partage le point de vue de Ia Banque sous rescrve que c:c resultat soat confortd dana le
cadre du futur Projet de (;estion des Ressources Naturciles en zone Pluviale (PGRNP).
En effet, les ACP ne sont pas Loutes construiles h partir d'un projet viable et la plupart
ont encurW he§bfl d'une assistance dtroitc de la part decs services de l'EtaL Pour appuycr
les actions du GouvernmennL, nuts avons hoa tio-                   tfbra'    rpoduant & un
vEritable objectif do Evevloppemecnt ruraL Dans l'uptique d'un ddveloppement durable,
I'augmentation des recettes des dIeveurs csE imperative. Pour cela j'Sfetend  qie le
PGRNP aide les ACP k valuriser 1'eisemtble des productions de leur membre, le lait
