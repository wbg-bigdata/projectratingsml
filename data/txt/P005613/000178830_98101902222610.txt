INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$5.6 million to help finance
a project for thie training of hotel personnel.  The loani would have a term of
25 vears, including 5 vears of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A basic economic mission visited Tunisia in February and March 1973
and is now finalizing its report following discussions with the Government.
The main conclusions of this report are reflected below. Country data sheets
are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources including water. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agri-
culture is highly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality
and, apart from phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petro-
leum was discovered and has since become an increasingly valuable source of
revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by
the small size of the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and expe-
rience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become
a significant item in the balance of payments. Real per capita income increased
by 4.4 percent annually between 1961 and 1972 to reach a level of $379. Tunisia
has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and has used this to expand economic
and social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, increase the rate of
growth, and make available a wide range of social and welfare services to a
large part of the population. Like most developing countries, however, it
has not yet found a way to eliminate unemployment and poverty and to achieve
a balanced distribution of consumption among income groups, between urban
and rural areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and preoccupation with restraint of inflation led to re-
course to a pervasive system of official price determination and administrative
controls. An unusually long series of poor crop years due to shortage of
rainfall slowed down growth of output. Many of the investments in public
enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private initiative in most sectors
except tourism and petroleum was discouraged. Growth was relatively slow
through 1969, but was combined with a high degree of domestic price stability.



-2-
5.        The Government9s present development strategy was introduced after
1969 and forms the basis of the current Fourth PlanP 1973-1976. The principal
objectives are (a) accelerating growth based on export-oriented industries,
mainly by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Government involve-
ment in production and relaxing admiinistrative regulations; (b) easing the
country's unemployment problem by creating new jobs primarily in the expanding
industrial sector, but also by encouraging worker emigration, reducing popula-
tion growth and improving education and training; and (c) maintaining internal
antl external financial stability. The target rate of GDP growth is 7.1 percent9
providing for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption.
Investment is projected to increase by 70 percent above Third Plan levels.
National savings are to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of
goods and services are projected to growJ at 8,8 percent per year at constant
prices and imports at 12.2 percent.   An increase in net external capital flows
of almost 100 percent over 1969-1972 average levels wvould be required, with
external capital providing 23,5 percent of total investment; the debt service
ratio would be hAeld to below 20 percent.  The Plan targets may be conservative
in terms of botlh growth and savings potential, and are affected significantly
bv the imrpact of the changed petroleum and pnosphates situations on the
Tunisian economy (paragraphs 7 and 8),
6.        The annual growth rate of the gross domestic product over the decade
1961-1970 was 5 percent0 A remarkable upsurge has taken place since 1970,
with GDP growing in real terms by 9 percent in 1971, and 18 percent in 1972,
The improvement can be attributed in part to exogenous factors such as good
weather, leading to record cereal crops and a three-fold increase in olive pro-
duction, in part to important growth in several areas (tourism, petroleum and
emigrant workers' remittances) which previous policies had fostered, and in
part to the general reorientation in Government policy since 1969, generating
renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector, By 1972, the in-
vestment rate was 23.6 percent of GDP compared to 20,8 percent in 1970; domestic
savings were 21,1 percent of GDP compared to 16.3 percent in 1970. Tunisia's
dependence on external borrowing declined from 31.6 to 13.6 percent of invest-
ment. The balance of paymeats has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit dropping from about $114 million up to 1967 to $44
million in 1972. Tle traditional negative net foreign exchange reserve posi-
tion was reversed in 1968, and at the end of 1973 net foreign assets amounted
to $256 million, covering 5.5 months of commodity imports.
7.        Following the very rapid expansion of the economy in 1972, the growth
rate slowed last year to an estimated 2.8 percent. Agricultural output fell
by 11,6 percent from the very hiigh 1972 level, increases in production of
cereals and livestock offsetting only part of the expected drop in olive pro-
duction. Growth may be about 9 percent in 1974. The Government is attempting
to maintain its past success in controlling inflation, though there will be
increased pressures arising from the Iidgher level of investment, the build-up
of foreign exchange reserves and the increased cost of imports. In the medium
term, and assuming no major recession in developed countries, Tunisia's gain
fronm the rise in petroleum and phosphate prices should more than offset the
effects of foreseeable adverse external developments on tourism earnings,
workers' remittances and other exports. Export earnings from petroleum are



-3-
now projected to increase fourfold from $98 million in 1973 to some $368 mil-
lion in 1976, and phosphate prices have also risen sharply.    As a result, small
surpluses in tlle current account of the balance of payments, and a rapid build-
up of reserves, may be expected over the next several years. A substantial
reduction in the net rate of enigration, originally projected at 20,000 per
year, could have serious repercussions on unemploynent and income, particularly
in rural areas, unless energetic measures are taken to increase labor absorp-
tion in other sectors.
8.        The increased foreign exchange reserves and Government surplus ex-
pected from higher export prices and consequent tax revenue do not call for
a basic revision in development strategy but suggest that Tunisia could step
up its efforts to achieve higher investment and growth rates and increased
employment, and to depend less on emigration and foreign aid. The main con-
straints are likely to be the speed at which policies and institutions respond
to the challenge and projects are prepared and executed. The new orientation
since 1969 and the improved economic situation provide the Government with an
opportunity to step up efforts to achieve its declared social objectives,
including greater impact on employment.,
9.        Tunisia has made some impressive social gains.    By 1971, primary
school enrollment had reached 73 percent and secondary enrollment 42 percent
of the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free, a family planning program introduced and social secur-
ity services provided to an increasing proportion of the labor force. Public
social expenditure, both current and capital, has increased at the rate of
9.3 percent per year and accounted for 14.5 percent of GDP in 1970. Nonethe-
less, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land reform.
Wide regional and income disparities are persistent and there has been a
growing concentration of productive activities in urban areas. Job creation
has not kept pace with the growth of the labor force, and in 1972 the unemploy-
ment rate was estimated at 14 percent.
10.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent o.'
GDP. Food processing industries account for another 5 percent of GDP and over
a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production jumped in
1971 and again in 1972, largely as a result of favorable weather, and the
potential for further growtlh is clear. While large infrastructure invest-
ments were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects
that make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes var-
ious constraints on agricultural development: absentee ownership and insecur-
ity of tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, the need to devote
more resources to extension services and agricultural education, and under-
utilization of irrigation investments. D 40 million has been allocated to a
rural development program to be executed by the provincial administrations.
11.       During the 1960's manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
7 percent annually. There was a remarkable 30 percent further increase in
1972 due in part to a record year for the olive oil processing industry.



- 4 -
The early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitu-
tion projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. Under the
Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in textiles,
fertilizers and metals transformation, is expected to average D 25 million
per year between 1973 and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing. Foreign private
investors have been offered incentives and are expected by Tunisia to contri-
bute through finance, know-how and overseas marketing, to creating competitive
industries producing a wide range of exports. Tunisia's preferential trade
agreement with the EEC, currently being renegotiated, also gives it some
advantages. Preinvestment work, and the preparation of programs for re-
equipment and modernization in priority subsectors have been started. Tunisia
aims to develop petroleum-based industries and production of phosphoric acid
and other phosphate derivatives for export, while possibilities for metal
manufacturing for export are being explored. The Plan further foresees the es-
tablishment of a small-scale industry fund to encourage growth and decen-
tralization of such industries.
12.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received large amounts of ex-
ternal capital. Official aid amounted to an average of US$19 per capita per
annum, almost half from the United States, mostly in the form of program loans
and PL 480 commodity aid. Other major lenders were France, the Federal Re-
public of Germany, Italy, Kuwait and the Bank Group. Project loans, partic-
ularly for public enterprises, accounted for 58 percent of total disbursements
in 1969-1972. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from 1969-
1972, the average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3 percent
interest and 27 years to maturity, including 9 years of grace; from multi-
lateral sources 5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6
years of grace. For private borrowing (about $40 million annually), average
terms were 6.0 percent interest and 9 years to maturity. Direct foreign pri-
vate investment in Tunisia has been limited. However, mainly as a result of
increasing outlays on petroleum exploration and development, it has risen
from an average of $19 million in the late 1960's to $40 million in 1972.
13.       Tunisia's total public external debt was $1,108 million (of which
$693 million were disbursed) at the end of 1972. Disbursed debt is estimated
to have been $862 million at the end of 1973. The debt service in 1973 is
estimated to have been 12.7 percent of exports of goods, non-factor services
and workers' remittances. The ratio is expected to fall significantly by
1976, following recent petroleum and phosphate price increases. Government
policy on future external borrowing in the light of its new balance of pay-
nients position is still under review. Tunisia is capable of servicing
substantial additional debt on harder terms than it has received in the past.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATICNS IN TUNISIA
14.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of sixteen Bank loans
and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $166.6 million and $65.7 million,
net of cancellations and refundings. A seventeenth loan, of $23 million, for
a third water supply project, was approved by the Executive Directors on May
28, 1974. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-
going projects.
15.       While there have been problems in project execution, as in the rail-
ways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole project
implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improvements
have been achieved. In both the transport and public utilities sectors,
independent agencies have been created or strengthened. The main Tunisian
development finance company, BDET, has been placed on a sound footing.
16.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in infrastructure. Lending for
transport, power and tourism infrastructure has accounted for 38 percent of
Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending for urban and social development,
including water supply, education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning
and public transport project, has accounted for a further 33 percent. Indus-
trial and hotel financing through Banque de Developpement Economique de
Tunisie (BDET, formerly Societe Nationale d'Investissement) comes third with
21 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 8 percent of total
commitments.
17.       Future lending is expected to support the further reorieniation of
the Government's economic policies towards rapid growth in a more open, ex-
port-oriented economy, measures to create employment and to achieve a more
equitable income distribution, and institutional change and reform. The
proposed lending program will emphasize agriculture, including rural develop-
m2nt, industry -- especially small-scale industry - and urban and social
development. The most important impact is hoped for in agriculture, requir-
ing substantial inputs of manpower and technical assistance to support the
creation of new institutions which can reach the rural poor. Over the next
several years, it is expected that a number of projects will be presented
which address the problems of land reform, organization for agricultural and
rural development, and integration of agricultural with other aspects of rural
development in such areas as the Medjerda and Nebhana Valleys, Sedjenane and
Central Tunisia. Lending to medium-size industrial companies through the
development finance company, BDET, will continue, but at a declining rate as
BDET diversifies its sources of funds. It will be supplemented by direct
industrial lending first for a project in phosphate mining and, later, in
other priority subsectors, now being studied with Bank technical assistance,
in which Tunisia has a comparative advantage and a potential for promoting
small-scale industries. Social development, particularly employment-oriented
training, will be furthered by the present project, as well as by a first
operation in the sewerage sector involving important organizational changes,
while a third education project will also be presented. Present Bank Group
commitments for tourism are substantial, but no further direct lending for
tourism is presently anticipated by the Bank.



- 6 -
18.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its share,
with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab, sources
of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding at the
end of 1972 and in debt service during 1972 were 18 percent and 7 percent
respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in total
external debt is not expected to vary much; its share in debt service will
probably rise to approach the share of debt outstanding.
19.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in, tourism projects) and in RYM (a large hotel
development). It has also made a small equity investment in the promotional
company "Sousse Nord", which is to prepare plans for an integrated tourism
resort development in the Sousse area, one of those in which tourism infra-
structure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW). On May 7, 1974 IFC's Board of Executive Directors
approved an equity investment of $621,000 in Industries Chimiques du Fluor,
which will produce aluminum fluoride from local fluorspar for export. IFC's
net commitments in Tunisia total $14.0 million with the incluision of this
investment.
PART III - TOURISM AND TOURISM TRAINING IN TUNISIA
20.       Centrally situated between the Eastern and Western basins of the
Mediterranean, Tunisia is the nearest point on the African continent to the
hub of the European tourist market in the London-Frankfurt-Paris triangle.
The country's 1,050 kilometers of coastline hare some of the finest beaches
of the Mediterranean with a pleasant climate prevailing for tne greater part
of the year.
21.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.    However,
between 1961 and 1972, tourist arrivals increased at an annual rate of 30
percent, rising from 46,000 to 780,000 - a performance unmatched by any other
Mediterranean country. Although continuous throughout that period, the growth
of foreign tourism slowed down in 1969 and 1970 as a result of a combination
of factors including political uncertainty, floods and a few cases of cholera.
The average growth rate of arrivals for these two years was only 11.5 percent.
The growth trend regained impetus in 1971 and 1972 however, when foreign-visitor
arrivals rose at an annual rate of 37 percent. The principal tourist-generating
market for Tunisia is Western Europe, which, in 1972, accounted for 83 percent
of total foreign arrivals; Germany, France and the U.K. are the three major
suppliers within this market. According to provisional data, decreases of 7%
in arr4vals and of 11% in visitor bednights were registered in 1973, largely
as a result of new cases of cholera and ill-timed price increases.
22.       The tourism sector has contributed significantly to Tunisia's econ-
omy. Between 1961 and 1972, gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism
climbed from US$3 million to an estimated US$143 million. From 1965 through
1973, tourism was the single most important source of foreign exchange earnings



- 7 -
for Tunisia. Average gross foreign exchange earnings per visitor rose from
S133 in 1969 to over $200 in 1973.   In 1973 total direct employment in tourism
was about 19,500 (some 2 percent of total full--time employment); 17,000 of
these persons were employed in hotels and the remainder in travel agencies and
transportation. Indirect employment related to the tourist industry accounted
for an estimated additional 19,000 jobs.
23.       Tunisia's accommodation capacity has exceeded targets set by suc-
cessive national development plans, expanding at an annual rate of 25 percent
between 1961 and 1972. At the end of 1973 the total capacity was about 56,000
beds. Since 1965 the capacity created, almost entirely (90 percent) through
private investments, has been in the main composed of hotels along the coast.
Supplementary accommodations (rooms in private homes, private residences,
camping sites, etc.), which make up a substantial share of other Mediterranean
countries' supply, are generally lacking in Tunisia. The increase in average
size of hotels from 56 beds in 1961 to 213 beds in 1973 has brought economies
of scale. Medium-class hotels now represent 65 percent of the accommodation
capacity, compared to 10 percent for first-class hotels.
24.       The Government has actively encouraged and guided tourism development.
The governmental organization responsible for tourism is an autonomous body,
the "Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme," or ONTT, under the supervi-
sion of the Ministry of the National Economy. ONTT is carrying out a major
tourism infrastructure program with Bank Group and KfW support. Through
generous fiscal incentives, the Government is promoting tourist hotel invest-
ments. In cooperation with the Bank, ONTT is presently undertaking a study
assessing the tourism investment incentive scheme and possibilities for re-
structuring it. The infrastructure financed by the Bank Group and KfW falls
within six priority development zones; these zones contain about 65 percent of
the country's hotel accommodation capacity and receive more than 80 percent of
foreign visitors. According to official estimates, 68 percent of hotel beds
opened in 1973 and to be opened in 1974 will be in the six priority zones, as
will 78 percent of future hotel projects.
25.       Spurred by the 1972 tourism boom, the Tunisian authorities have
advanced to 1976 the 1,300,000 foreign-visitor arrivals target set earlier
for 1980. According to these revised projections, foreign-visitor arrivals
as well as hotel bednights should increase at an annual rate of about 14
percent. The target of the Fourth Plan (1973-1976) is 84,000 beds by 1976,
an annual increase of 8,500 beds. The occupancy rate of tourist accommodation
was 32 percent in 1969, rose to 41 percent in 1972 and, on the basis of pro-
visional data, appears to have fallen to 31 percent in 1973; although somewhat
low, even the 1973 figure can be considered within the normal range for coun-
tries dependent on seasonal tourism.
26.       The adverse developments in 1973 mentioned above, and the effects
of the energy crisis on Tunisian tourism may call for some revision of tar-
gets set for the next two years, but are unlikely to affect the long-term
trends,which justify the hotel training project. The effects of the energy



crisis are difficult to assess, but a leveling off of tourism demand, partic-
ularly from Europe, could reasonably be expected in 1974 and 1975. by 1976
there would probably be a return to increased growth in line with long-term
trends, but the decrease in demand might lead to a lower rate of occupancy
of hotels in 1974 and 1975 and conceivably to a short-term reduction in
hotel investments.    Because of Tunisia's comparatively short distance from
Europe, the country is likely to be at an advantage compared to competitor
countries further away.
27.       Tourism training in Tunisia is the responsibility of two agencies:
The Office des Travailleurs Tunisiens a l'Etranger, de ltEmploi et de la
Formation Professionnelle (OTTEEFP) and ONTT. OTTEEFP is in charge of the
hotel apprenticeship program, as a part of the national apprenticeship pro-
gram; potential apprentices enter the OTTEEFP program after primary school
or up to two years of secondary school. ONTT is responsible for vocational
training for middle and upper level hotel staff. Candidates for middle-
level positions enter ONTT's hotel schools with from one to six years of
secondary education, depending on the course te be followed. Middle manage-
ment (e.g. personnel managers) and senior supervisory (e.g. maitre d'hotel)
staff are trained at ONTT's Institut Superieur de Tourisme et d'Hotellerie;
a baccalaureate or training abroad is normally required for admission to the
Institut, which is soon to move from Monastir to modern facilities at Sidi
Dhrif in the Tunis area. The combined output of ONTT and OTTEEFP programs
was 720 in 1972, as against the annual requirement of the hotel industry for
2,500 trained staff.
28.       Aside from the quantitative problems, both OTTEEFP and ONTT programs
have a number of qualicative weaknesses: training facilities are inadequate
and often located in unsuitable premises; curricula are inconsistent, and
qualified, experienced teachers too few; diplomas granted have no legal re-
cognition, which creates dissatisfaction among graduates and complicates the
hiring process for hotel operators.   Unless hotel training programs are sub-
stantially improved and expanded, hotel service will decline and Tunisia's
competitive position may be undermined.   The shortage of trained middle
level staff is expected to rise from 7,740 in 1973 to 12,050 at the end of
thte Fourth Plan in 197;6.
PART IV - TiE PROJECT
iiis torv
29,       During the appraisal of the Tourisii Infrastructure Project (Loan
856-TUN and Credit 329-TUN) in 1971, the Bank and the Tunisian authorities
agreed that one of the major constraints to development of tourism in Tunisia
was the shortage of trained hotel staff. Accordingly, funds were included in
the Tourism Infrastructure Project to finance a study of ways to expand and
rationalize the country's tourism training system. In 1973, the Tunisian
Government engaged ILO to prepare the study.    The study was completed in
November 1973 and formed the basis for the appraisal, in January 1974, of the



-9-
proposed Bank loan. Negotiations were held in Washington in May, 1974. The
Republic of Tunisia and ONTT were represented by Mr. Sadok Bouraoui, Director-
General of ONTT.
The Project
30.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Hotel Training Project - Tunisia"
(No. 41la-TUN, dated May 23, 1974) is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
31.       The proposed project is designed to help meet manpower requirements
in the hotel industry, to improve present approaches to hotel training by
standardizing and upgrading methodology and curricula in all hotel schools,
and to reduce, by over 50 percent, the cost of training of a qualified hotel
worker by decreasing the training period from two years to one year or less.
The project would include: (a) the construction of three hotel training
centers each comprising a hotel school, a 100 bed practice hotel (3-star
category), student dormitories, and staff housing for senior faculty; and
(b) about 12.5 man-years of technical assistance for curriculum development
and implementation and for teacher training.
32.       At full development, project facilities would annually train about
1,000 persons for middle level positions in the hotel industry. In 1979,
this would cover about 32 percent of middle level manpower requirements; an
additional 42 percent would be met by other ONTT facilities. The expansion
of the hotel training system should not aim at meeting 100 percent of projec-
ted manpower requirements. A margin of flexibility is necessary to reduce
the risk of underutilization of facilities and to permit the smooth develop-
ment of the training system as teaching methods and courses evolve.
33.       Each hotel school would include general purpose classrooms as well
as facilities required for training in languages and hotel services. Train-
ing programs would be offered at each center for about 325 students, in ac-
counting and control, reception and front office work, restaurant and bar
employment, kitchen work, and storekeeping. The practice hotels, specially
designed for training purposes, would be open to the public and would func-
tion commercially, with all the departments and services found in other
Tunisian hotels. Construction of one of the practice hotels may involve
renovation and conversion of an old palace in the Tunis Medina, and thus
contribute to the preservation of the capital's rich architectural heritage.
The practice hotel staff would be students in the hotel schools receiving
mandatory practical training as part of their education, and (except for a
few key permanent employees) the management would be their teachers.
34.       The technical assistance program would include two components.     The
first would provide for assistance in the detailed planning of new courses
and their introduction into existing and new schools. A chief of program
planning, supported by two additional experts in training of hotel staff,
would advise on curriculum development and implementation. The second, or
teacher-training component of the program, would be executed by five expa-
triate technical experts, each appointed for a period of 18 months. Tunisian
counterpart staff would be assigned to both sections of the technical assist-
ance program.

35.       One important aspect of hotel training, the training of hotel main-
tenance personnel, has not been included in the project; it can be given more
properly in industrial vocational schools where demonstration and practice
equipment is available. OTTEEFP, which already administers the hotel appren-
ticeship scheme, is willing and able to expand its training of maintenance
personnel. Under Section 2.11 of the Project Agreement, ONTT would enter into
arrangements with OTTEEFP satisfactory to the Bank for the training of hotel
maintenance personnel by OTTEEFP within one year of the signing of the loan.
Project Execution
36.       The project would be carried out by ONTT.    ONTT is a well run,
efficient agency, fully capable of carrying out the project with the support
contemplated under the loan.    ONTT's performance in executing the $55 mil-
lion Tourism Infrastructure Project suggests that it would have no difficulty
in carrying out the proposed project.
37.       Under Section 3.01 (b) of the Project Agreement, ONTT would entrust
the Project Unit, set up under the Tourism Infrastructure Project, with the
following additional responsibilities for the execution of the works components
of the project: coordination of architectural services; review of designs for
project works and preparation of master lists and specifications of furniture
and equipment; preparation of bidding and contract documents and subsequent
evaluation of bids; supervision of construction; coordination of the work of
various government ministries and other agencies concerned with the physical
execution of the project; and preparation and submission of quarterly reports
to the Bank. An additional architect or engineer, and appropriate supporting
staff, would be assigned to the Project Unit for the hotel training project.
Separate accounts would be maintained for the two projects. ONTT would retain
consulting architects acceptable to the Bank for the design of the project
training centers (Section 2.02 of the Project Agreement).
33.      IW'hile the Director of the Project Unit would continue to report
directly to the Director-General of ONTT, the technical assistance program
would be supervised by ONTT's Department of Tourism Training. During appraisal
and negotiations possibilities for arranging grant financing of the technical
assistance program, by UNDP or bilateral sources, were explored. The UNDP
Indicative Planning Figure for Tunisia of $15 million for 1972-1976 has already
been over-programmed, and no other suitable source of finding has been found.
Therefore, Bank financing of the technical assistance components of the proj-
ect is recommended.   The Tunisian authorities may contract with ILO for exec-
ution of the teclnical assistance program.
39.       It was agreed that ONTT would take all steps necessary to establish
a teacher training section at the Institut Superieur de Tourisme et d'Hotellerie
whien it moves to its new location at: Sidi Dhrif in October, 1975 (Project Agree-
ment, Section 2.09). Measures would be taken to make teaching at ONTT's hotel
training schools attractive both in status and salary, in order to recruit a
competent and stable teaching staff. ONTT has agreed, within one year of the
signing of the loan to take the action necessary to establish the rights, ob-
ligations, salary and status of teachers in its hotel training schools (Project



- 11 -
Agreement, Section 2.11). Wlithin the same period, the Covermnent would take
all action necessary to grant legal recognition to diplomas and certificates
issued by ONTT's hotel training schools (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
40.       ONTT's Department of Tourismi Trainiing would continiue to be responsible
for administration of the tourism  training svstenm, including the three training
centers.  Within a year of thie signature of the Loan Agreement, a iNational
Council for Tourism Training, consisting of representatives of interested
public and private agencies, would be created to advise ONTT on all policy
matters related to the training of tourism staff (Section 3.03 of the Loan
Agreement).  Simnilar functions would be carriecl out for the project training
centers by advisory boards to be created for each center (Project Agreement,
Section 2.10).  To strengthien the presently inadequate staff of ONTT's Depart-
ment of Tourism Training, a Deputy Director would be recruited, in consulta-
tion with the Bank (Section 3.01 (b) (iii) of the Project Agreement). lie
would supervise the work of a planning unit in charge of determining the
number of teachers and pupils to be trained. The directors of the project
training centers, the existing hotel schools and the Sidi Dlirif Institute,
would report directly to the Deputy Director.
Cost hstimates and Financing Plan
41.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.3 million equiv-
alent, including allowances for physical and price contingencies, but excluding,
the cost of land, which would be provided by the Tunisian Government. The cost
estirnntes include the impact of recent developments in energy prices. Contin-
gency allowances include: (a) price increases estimated at 10 percent per
annum; and (b) physical contingencies amounting to 10 percent of the estimated
cost of site development, construction, furniture and equipment. The foreign
cost component is estimated at US$5.6 million, net of interest and other
charges during construction. It represents 46 percent of total cost. The
costs of operation of the project hotel schiools would be covered by the Gov-
ernment under the ONTT budget. In 1933, the total net operating costs of
the project centers are expected to be about $1.3 million (1974 prices).
42.       The Bank loan of $5.6 rmillion would cover the total foreign exchange
cost of the project. Since the objective of the project is educational rathcr
than commercial, the proceeds of the Bank loan would be granited to ONTT rather
than on-lent.  The funds required to finance the local cost component (US$6.7
million equivalent) would also be provided bv the Government as a grant to
ONTT. Thie practice hotels would generate income but would only be able to
cover operating costs.
Procurement
43.       The agreed procurement arrangements are set out in Schedule 1 of
the Project Agreement. For construction works, contracts would be awarded on
tihe basis of international competitive bidding to pre-qualified contractors
in accordance with Bank Guidelines.  It is expected, however, that thile con-
tracts would be won by Tunisian firms as the country has a competitive con-
struction industry capable of carrying out the proposed project. Subject to



- 1t2 -
case-bv-case approval bv tile liank, OUTT would he pernitted to follow its local
procurement procedures for snall construction contracts estimated not to ex-
ceed j100,000. Contracts for tiie suDplv of furniture and equipment would be
awarded oni tile basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bian;k Guidelines.  In the evaluation of hids, domestic -manufacturers would be
accorded a preferential margin of 15 percent of thie C.I.F. price of competing
imiports or thie rate of customs duty applicable, whichever is the lower. Fur-
niture contracts would probablv be won by local manufacturers and most equip-
ment contracts bv foreign manufacturers.
Disbursement
44.       The proposei loan of US$5.6 iililion would be disbursed to meet:  100
percent of foreign expencditures or 35 percent of the ex-factorv cost of locally
manufactured furniture and eqlulipment; 39 percent of total expenditures for
civil works anid associated services; 37 percent of tihe cost of project admin-
istration representinc the estimated foreign exchange cost; aiid 100 percent of
tlie foreil,n exchange cost of the technical assistance experts.
'r2J-ect Justification
45.       The proposed ]loan would assist 1Tunisia to expand and substantially
im,1prove its hiotel training system. Thie plivsical comiponent of the project
wouild ;rovide three inodern, efficient facilities whose graduates, trained
in a suitable educational environment, would Fleet 27 percent of the country's
estimated total requirements for middle level liotel personnel in 1983. In
tihat vear net operating cost of project facilities per trained studlent is ex-
pected to be about US$914 (1974 prices), comipared to abotut IU,S$1 ,900 in 1974.
Tile extension of carefullv conceived curricula and teaching method2s to both
existing andl proposed schools under tile technical assistance program would
rationailize the country's hotel training svstemii.  The introduction of thle
proposed legislation regulating the position of teachers, studlents and hotel
employees waould give a new status to the hotel profession. 'lhe proposed in-
stitutional arrangements, particularvly tile creacion of the National Council
roi TouJrism 'training, wouldl improve cooperation between the Government and
the private sector and would enable tite training svstem to respond more
cui cklv to the needs of tlhe industrv.  Thie project woul(d thius provide a rnodel
for practical, eiiployment-oriented vocational training.
4 b.      The impact of the project on thie hiotel induistrv would be felt througli
hillier standards of service and increased labor productivitv, leadingt to sav-
ingws in maintenance and operating costs.  Impr-oved hotel service wotuld also
result in greater guest comfort and satisfaction andi twould have favorable
repercussions on repeat visitor traffic and1 possib)ly on occupancy levels; it
would ultilimatelv be instrumental in enhancinfg the reputation of tile country
as a tourist destination.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
ClosinLg Date: (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1974.
Physical execution of the project is almost completed. All project
schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtually
all equipment and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been de-
livered and installed. Despite early delays in the appointment of UNESCO
experts and their counterparts in the Educational Planning Unit, an interim
report, including a diagnosis of primary and general secondary education and
a preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However, the
report does not cover vocational and technical training, education finances
and management, and administration of the education system. To allow for
the utilization of savings and the completion of the technical assistance
program, a further extension of the present Closing Date is likely to be re-
quired.
Ln. 573: Port Development Project; US$8.5 million loan of November 29. 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1972; (current) December 31, 1974.
Project works have been completed at a total cost slightly above ap-
praisal estimates, due mainly to unexpected price increases and unforeseen soil
conditions, which delayed construction. Savings in foreign exchange of about
$0.2 million are being used to finance a ports master plan study whose execu-
tion is about to begin. The Closing Date has been extended to permit comple-
tion of the study.
Ln. 581:  First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1974.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The first project is proceeding well after initial delays and com-
pletion is expected shortly, about a year later than estimated originally.
The Closing Date has therefore been extended. Final project costs are expected
to be about 6 percent below appraisal estimates (but 7 percent higher in dollar
terms because of devaluation). The second project is 12 to 18 months behind
schedule due in part to initial delays in final design and to pipe manufacture
constraints.  More recently, progress has been slowed by a dispute between a
contractor and the project authority. Discussions have taken place with a
view to settlement of the dispute and to resumption of normal progress on the
contracts affected. Final costs are forecast to be similar to original es-
timates, though about 20 percent higher in dollar terms. Because of the delays
in execution, it is expected that the Closing Date will have to be extended.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606: Railways Project; US$S.5 million loan and US$3.5 million credit,
Cr. 150: both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date of loan:    (original) December 31,
1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed botlh by floods (one vear) and by finan-
cial difficulties (one vear). It is now expected to be substantially completed
by December 31, 1974. The financial problems were caused by non-payment of
freight clharges by tile railway's largest customer, the state-controlled Sfax-
Gafsa Plhosplhate CompanY; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares; and
higher than estimated prices of rolling stock. The Government has taken over
the Phosphate Company's pre-1973 arrears and the Company itself is expected to
improve its payment record, phosplhate prices having recently risen sharply.
Government has also undertaken to reimburse railway losses for 1972 and 1973.
A new cost-based tariff was introduced on January 1, 1974; traffic and oper-
ating results, however, have not improved as expected, and continuing Govern-
ment contributions to the railways and furtlher tariff increases will be re-
quired. A reallocation of the proceeds of the loan and credit permitted the
placing of all outstanding orders; cost increases of about $6 million for
items in the original list of goods are being financed by utilizing a Spanish
line of credit.  The credit has been fully disbursed; the Closing Date of the
loan has been extended to the end of 1975 to permit completion of project
execution.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After a slow start, resulting in a 24-month delay, there has been
some progress in this project, but many problems remain. A new Director
General has recently been appointed to the National Office for Family Planning
and Population. Preliminary designs have been completed and final design of
project facilities is progressing well.   Construction on the Tunis Maternity
Hospital is expected to start in October 1974. Construction costs for the
urban maternity hospitals are estimated at more than twice the amount es-
timated by architectural consultants at appraisal; one maternity hospital
and two rural maternity centers are b3eing eliminated from tile project. !ie
total cost of thec revised project is now estimated at more than $13 million
in place of the $7.7 million estimated at appraisal. Supervision of the
physical execution of the project is being intensified.
Ln. 746: Ilighwavs Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
£Lengthy Covernment procedures and changes in kcey personnel, is now proceeding
s5atisfactorily.  The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
m2iinlv as a result of dollar devaluation. One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project. The Government has been requested to provide supple-
er.ntary funds to permit cormpletion of the other project components.

Ln. 771:  Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 inillion loan and USS3 million
Cr. 263:  crelit, both of July 12, 1971; Closing Dates:    July 31, 1975.
Disbursements are behiind schiedule, especially for lending for dairy
farms since the cost of imported cowrs has risen and there is competition be-
tween Bank/IDA and other cheaper funds. A severe flood in M'arch 1973 also
affected project progress. Consultations are underway with a viewq to accel-
erating the progress of thie project.
Cr. 270: Fislheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
After unsuccessful efforts to design a completely new and economical
vessel, it was decided to concentrate on improving construction techniques,
materials and design of the existing traditional inshiore fishiing boat. As a
result of substantial cost increases due to factors unrelated to the project,
the number of boats wlhiclh can be procured will be reduced by about 50 percent.
ikowever, demand for boats at the higher prices remains strong as fishi prices
have also increased substantially.   A procurement disptute delaved award of thte
contract for rmarine diesel engines; this has now beeni resolved.  Bids have been
requested for supply of boat hiulls, and IDA has encouraged extension of thie
existing techniical assistance contracts.
Ln. 358:  Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 millioln
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 23, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors.    The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are aLmost
on schedule.  Invitations for bids for some project works hlave been issued.

Ln. 648:  Third Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
December 24, 1969; Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973;
(current) June 3D, 1974.
Ln. 798:  Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: I1arcli 31, 1976.
Ln. 881:  Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date: 'March 31,L 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 648 are almost complete; those under Ln. 798
are sligphtly behind schedule, while disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of
schedule. Business greatly exceeded projections in 1973 and is continuing at
an accelerated rate. Persistent problems are the substantial amount of arrears
of hotel borrowers and the lackc of valid mortgage security for certain sub-
lorns; these are being closely watched.   The dependence of BJDET (ex-SNI) on
the Government ancl the IBRD is expectecd to be reduced bv BDET's raising con-
-iderable funcds from local and other foreign sources and by dliscussions in
progress on Covernment-BDET financial arrangements.    A request for a sixth
loan is under consideration.
Ln. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and P'ublic Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:  million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and in recruitment of
Tunisian staff for the Tunis District, the loan and credit for this project
have not yet become effective.   As the offer of the Tunisian supplier fell
within 15 percent of the international reference price agreed with the Bank/
lI)A, the public transport company (SNT) has decided to award him the contract
for supply of project buses.
