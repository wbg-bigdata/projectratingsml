APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.       This report appraises a hotel training project designed
to alleviate the acute shortage of trained hotel staff in Tunisia.
ii.      Between 1961 and 1972, foreign visitor arrivals in
Tunisia increased from 46,000 to 780,000 and the number of hotel
beds from 4,000 to 48,000. As a result of this dynamic growth,
tourism has become an important sector of the country's economy.
In 1972, it was the largest single source of foreign exchange,
accounting for 22% of current receipts.
iii.     Owing to insufficient hotel training facilities, Tunisia
has been unable to train the number of hotel staff required to
keep pace with the rapid expansion of the hotel industry. Only
2,500 (or 15%) of the 17,000 employees in the hotel industry at
the end of 1973 had received formal training and service in
Tunisian hotels leaves much to be desired.
iv.      The proposed project would include the construction of
three hotel training centers in Tunis, Hammamet and Sousse. Each
training center would comprise a hotel school, a 100-bed practice
hotel, student dormitories and staff housing. The project would
also include 12.5 man-years of technical assistance to support
development of the educational program and teacher training.
v.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.3
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.6
million equivalent (46% of total project cost). Construction
cost estimates are based on functional and economical accommodation
schedules and current unit building costs. The balance of the
funds required to finance the project, including any cost overruns,
would be provided by the Government. Building contracts and
contracts for the supply of furniture and instructional equipment
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines.
vi.      The facilities to be built under the proposed project
would increase the capacity of ONTT-operated hotel training
schools from 1,050 to 2,410 student places. This would raise



- 1Ji -
the number of students trained from 14% of annual requirements for
level IV hotel staff in 1974 to 63% in 1983.
vii.      Through its technical assistance components, the project would
help rationalize the current tourismi training system. New training
methods and curricula developed under the proposed technical assistance
program would be applied to all hotel schools (i.e. both existing and
to be built under the project) in Ttnisia and would provide teachers
and students alike with a modern ancl efficient training environment.
At the same time, the project would lead to important savings. Training
programs would be reduced from two years' to one year's duration and the
costs of training one student are estimated to decrease from US$1,900 to
US$900. The operating costs of ONTT's tourism training program would
stabilize at less than 1% of foreign exchange receipts from tourism.
viii.     The project would be managed by ONTT which has overall
responsibility for the tourism sector and for the tourism infrastructure
project financed in part by the Bank Group under LOAN No. TUN-858 and
CREDIT No. TUN-329. The project unit (Direction des Travaux) for the
infrastructure project would be expanded and would coordinate architec-
tural services, prepare master lists and specifications for furniture
and equipment, and organize international competitive bidding for
project contracts. ONTT's Departmernt of Tourism Training would be
responsible for supervising the technical assistance program and for
operating the training system.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5.6 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of five
years. The Bank loan would be made to the Government of Tunisia.



TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      During appraisal of the tourism infrastructure project
(LOAN No. TUN-858; CREDIT No. TUN-329) in 1971, the Bank mission and
the Tunisian authorities agreed t`hat one of the major constraints to
development of tourism in Tunisia was the acute shortage of trained
hotel staff. Accordingly, funds were included in that project to
study ways of expanding and rationalizing the country's tourism
training system. The study, entrusted to ILO, was completed late
in 1973.
1.02      The appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Christie, Vera,
Bauer, Hery (consultant) and Jones (consultant) completed its field
work in January, 1974. In the field, Mr. Fresco (consultant) assisted
in site selection. Mr. Maffei, of the Bank's Legal Department,
assisted the mission in legal matters.
1.03      The project would be a logical follow-up to the present
involvement of the Bank Group in tourism in Tunisia. In addition to
the tourism infrastructure project, the Bank has participated in
financing tourism investments through the Banque de Developpement
Economique de Tunisie (BDET). IFC has participated in hotel financing
through BDET and COFITOUR; more recently, it has acquired direct partic-
ipation in a large hotel and in the Sousse Nord tourism development
scheme.
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Economy
2.01      An analysis of Tunisia's economy appeared in the report
"Current Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia" (EMA-51a) dated
August 14, 1972.
2.02      From 1961 to 1969, Tunisia's GDP grew at the rate of 5%
per annum. In the next three years, the country's output increased
at the high rate of 11% due primarily to the exceptional performance
of agriculture and major changes in economic policy.  The overall
growth rate of GDP over the 1961-1972 period was 6.6% per annum.
2.03      Foreign exchange earnings from tourism have contributed
substantially to support the country's rapid economic expansion.
Earnings from tourism are helping to fill the deficit on trade account
and in 1973 were the largest single source of foreign exchange.



-2-
With good prospects for expansion, tourism should continue to
strengthen the balance of payments, spur further economic growth
and help reduce unemployment and underemployment.
2.04     Hotel investments follow the territorial distribution
of tourism assets, most of which are along coastal areas and in
the poorer southern provinces of the country. The sector should
increasingly contribute to alleviating regional disparities in
income and employnent.
B. The Tourism Sector
2.05     In the 1960's, the jet airplane brought Tunisia and its
tourism assets within easy reach of travelers from Western Europe
(London, Paris and Frankfurt are within 1,100 miles of Tunis)
and a tourism boom developed, at first largely confined to
higher-income groups, but later, as charter flights and package
tours became popular, spreading to medium-income tourists.
2.06     Between 1961 and 1972, foreign visitor arrivals in
Tunisia increased at an annual rate of almost 30% from 46,000
to 780,000, a growth rate unmatched by any other Mediterranean
country. In 1973, there was a 7% decrease in arrivals over
1972 and average hotel bed occupancies (Annex 2, Table 1) declined
from a high of 41% in 1972 because prices had reached high levels;
because of some cases of cholera; and latterly because of the
impact of the energy crisis. In 1972, Western Europe accounted
for 83% of total arrivals, with Germany (22%), France (20%)
and the United Kingdom (18%) ranking in the top positions.
The number of hotel beds increased from 3,950 in 1961 to about
55,900 at the end of 1973, concentrated mainly in the zones of
Tunis, Nabeul-Hammamet, Sousse-Skanes-Monastir, and Djerba-Zarzis.
2.07     About 60% of visitors and vacationers travel on inclusive
tours covering transportation, accommodation and board. These
modes of travel have influenced the type of service offered by
the Tunisian hotel industry. Because of the large groups involved,
guest arrivals and departures have to be carefully coordinated
with charter flight schedules; menus are limited for economy and
to enable faster service; reservations, accounting and operating
systems are simpler than in more traditional hotels. Catering as
it does mainly to the middle-income group tour market, the
Tunisian hotel industry has had to economize in the use of labor
and employs only 0.35 persons per bed.
2.08     In 1973, employees in tourism were about 19,500 or 2%
of total full-time employment in Tunisia. Indirect employment
related to the tourism industry accounted for an estimated
additional 19,000.



- 3 -
2.09     From 1965 through 1973, tourism was the single most
important source of foreign exchange.  Gross foreign exchange
earnings from tourism increased from TD 1.5 million (or 2.5% of
current receipts) in 1961 to TD 68.4 million (or 22.1% of current
receipts) in 1972. Net foreign exchange receipts from tourism
increased from about 46% of gross foreign exchange receipts in
1964 to about 70% in 1972 as a greater proportion of tourists'
reauirements were met from domestic sources.
2.10     The Government is committed to the continued growth of
the tourism sector. Under the Fourth Plan, it is expected that
about 80,000 beds will be in operation at the end of 1976. Such
a build-up of accommodation appears reasonable, despite the
disappointing results of 1973. Tourism is likely to be affected
in the short run by higher fuel prîces resulting from the energy
crisis; on the other hand, Tunisia, as an oil exporting country, is
able to make adequate fuel supplies available to both domestic and
foreign aircraft used for tourism. A more fundamental point is the
competitive position of Tunisian hotels (para. 2.06). The Govern-
ment has recently enacted measures establishing price controls as
part of its efforts to assure the industry's competitiveness in
international markets. In the longer term, Tunisia's tourism assets
and its proximity to Europe are expected to permit a sustained
growth of the sector and to support the projected build-up of
accommodation capacity.
2.11     The Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme (ONTT),
formally established in July, 1971 (Decree No. 71-264), is the
agency responsible for tourism (Annex VI). Although under the
supervision of the Ministry of National Economy, ONTT is semi-
autonomous and has the power to manage its own finances, contract
loans, make payments and hire personnel beyond the normal res-
trictions for departments of the Government. ONTT has five
directorates (plus regional offices) covering programs; operations;
promotion; administration and finance; and training.
2.12     A major obstacle to the growth of the tourism sector
is the shortage of trained personnel. Poor hotel service, parti-
cularly during the peak summer months helps explain the low rate
of "repeat" visitors in Tunisia and has started to affect hotel
occupancies adversely.
C. Education and Training for the Hotel Industry
2.13     Tourism training in Tunisia is the responsibility of two
agencies: the Office des Travailleurs Tunisiens a l'Etranger, de
l'Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle (OTTEEFP) and ONTT.
An agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs, OTTEEFP is in charge
of the hotel apprenticeship program, as a part of the national
apprenticeship program.  Hotel apprenticeship courses are offered
in eight vocational training centers distributed throughout the
country.



- 4 -
2.14      ONTT  is in charge of vocational training for middle and
upper level hotel staff. It operates six schools located at Bizerte,
La Marsa, Sidi Dhrif, Sousse, Monastir and Djerba. It also operates
the Institut Superieur de Tourisme et d'Hotellerie (Institute) at
Monastir which provides training for supervisory staff. In the
past ten years, ONTT has adopted two successive approaches to tourism
training. The first, the "polyvalent" method (designed to train
students in several specialties) was dropped in 1968 in favor of a
system which trained students in one specialty only.
2.15      Both current OTTEEFP and ONTT-sponsored programs have a
number of weaknesses. Training facilities are inadequate and often
located in unsuitable premises, such as ex-military barracks.
Curricula are inconsistent and qualified, experienced teachers too
few. Communications with the private sector are poor. Diplomas
granted have no legal recognition, which creates dissatisfaction
amongst graduates and complicates the hiring process for hotel
operators. As a result of these weaknesses, both OTTEEFP and ONTT-
sponsored programs have failed to respond to the actual needs of the
industry from both quantitative and qualitative standpoints. The
combined output of these programs totalled 720 in 1972, as against
the hotel industry's annual requirements of 2,500 trained staff, and
hotel operators find that the proficiency of the staff graduated by
either program leaves much to b'e desired (Annex III).
2.16      The current structure of hotel jobs in Tunisia includes
six levels (Chart 1). Level I covers top management and normally
requires the baccalaureate plus training in a hotel management
school abroad. Level II covers middle management (e.g. personnel
manager) and senior supervisory staff (e.g. maitre d'hotel). The
normal entry requirements for Level II are the baccalaureate followed
by courses at the Institute, or alternatively, a period of training
abroad. Levels III and IV cover such personnel as table waiters and
cooks and normally require three to five years of secondary education
for entry (promotion to Level III is routine after appropriate expe-
rience at Level IV). Level V are those who enter the industry by way
of the apprenticeship program, and completed primary education is the
normal entry requirement. Level VI staff are those who require only
minor on-the-job training. The following table shows the distribution
of the 17,000 persons currently employed in the hotel industry
according to level:
Level                %
I                 1.4
II                4.5
III              16.7
IV               46.3

2.17       The Education Sector and Tourism Training in Tunisia
are reviewed in more detail in Annexes III and IV.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01       The Appraisal Mission agreed with the reconmendations of
both the Government and ILO that any expansion of the hotel training
program should focus primarily on level IV for full-time training
and on part-time refresher and upgrading courses to level III. These
two levels, accounting for almost two-thirds of hotel staff, repre-
sent the most important categories of staff to be trained. Con-
centrating hotel training efforts on levels III and IV was also
prompted by the fact that requirements for other levels are basically
being met, those for levels I and II by the Institute and by training
abroad and those for level V by the apprenticeship program.
3.02       It is expected that the stock of employees at level IV in
Tunisian hotels will increase from 9,400 in 1974 to 25,000 in 1983.
During the same period, the flow of new staff requirements is expected
to increase from 2,400 to 3,800 annually. These forecasts are based
on the assumption that 8,000 beds would be added annually over the
next ten years, i.e. 2,000 less than the 10,000 beds to be completed
in 1974 and somewhat less than t:he Fourth Plan's annual forecast.
In line with current Tunisian experience, the abovementioned fore-
casts further assume that each new bed will create 0.208 jobs at
level IV and that the annual staff attrition rate will be 8%.
3.03       The proposed expansion of hotel training programs in
Tunisia will be based on the concept of the hotel training center,
consisting of a hotel school, a practice hotel and student housing.
The distinguishing feature of the concept (which would be new in
Tunisia but which has been applied successfully in other countries)
is that students would be given academic training and practical
experience simultaneously. The hotels would be staffed by students,
except for a few key personnel. The faculty would have hotel
management and teaching responsibilities. Compared to the appren-
ticeship system, the hotel training center is well suited to the
Tunisian industry where most hotel employees have no formal hotel
training and thus can do little to help train new employees. Appli-
cation of the hotel training center concept would permit work
covered in class to be put into practice in a controlled environment
and at the same time assure students of good practical experience
in an operating hotel. Students would be required to live in the
student housing provided as part of the process of cultural adjust-
ment to the new environnent they will find working in hotels.



- 6 -
3.04      The expansion of the hotel training program should not be
aimed at meeting 100% of projected staff requirements (para. 3.02).
A margin of flexibility is necessary:  (1) to reduce the risk that
the facilities, which are a long-term fixed investment, are under-
utilized for a part of their physical life, and (2) to allow for
the smooth development of the system as teaching and training methods
evolve. At the same time, allowance must be made for part-time
refresher and upgrading courses. Analysis of these factors under
reasonable assumptions for growth of accommodation capacity (para.
3.02) shows that the target for planned expansion of hotel training
facilities should be set at about 1,000 places. Weighing this
target against accepted international standards according to which
one hotel training center should have a practice hotel of about 50
rooms and accommodation for about 300 students, it will be necessary
to build three such facilities.
3.05      Hotel training centers should be located in more populated
regions in order to facilitate recruitment. At the same time, they
should be close to resort areas to ensure employment for graduates.
In the light of these criteria, Tunis, Hanmmamet and Sousse were
selected as ideal locations for the training centers. These three
areas combined account for 40% of the national population and 70%
of total Tunisian hotel accommodation capacity. Building in these
locations would also serve the purpose of filling in gaps in the
geographic distribution of the existing training centers.
B. Proîect Description
3.06      The proposed project would consist of:
Part A. The establishment of three hotel training
centers each comprising:
a. a hotel school;
b. a 100-bed practice hotel (3-star category);
c. student dormitories for 325 persons; and
d. staff housing for senior faculty.
Part B. About 12.5 man-years of technical assistance for:
a. an educational program development and
implementation unit; and
b. a teacher training unit.
Part A. Physical Facilities
3.07      The exact sites within the selected zones of Tunis,
Hammamet and Sousse, had not been determined at the time of



-7-
appraisal. During negotiations, the Tunisians presented three sites
for Bank consideration. The locations proposed for Sousse and
Hammamet appear to be acceptable. The third location comprises
a palace in the medina of Tunis to be converted into a practice
hotel and a site for the hotel school and dormitories to be built
on a nearby vacant site owned by the Government. A Bank mission
will visit Tunis in mid-June, 1974, to determine the technical and
economic feasibility of the proposal. If the site is found to be unac-
ceptable, the Tunisians will be required to find an alternative site
in Tunis. In any case, legal possession of sites acceptable to the
Bank would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
3.08       In each training center, the school portion would include
general purpose classrooms; a language laboratory and classroom;
workshops; a kitchen specially designed for training purposes, a
self-service restaurant, guest dining room and bar; demonstration
guest rooms and bathrooms, pantries and a linen room; and training
reception and accounting offices. In each training center, the
practice hotel would be built as a 3-star hotel, including 50 bed-
rooms with bathrooms and a food and beverage department. This is
the size most suitable for training purposes. The practice hotels
would be open to the public and would function commercially with all
the departments and services generally found in Tunisian 3-star
hotels.  The school and the hotel would share a laundry and central
stores. Student housing would be in the form of dormitories parti-
tioned into groups of four beds, with housing for student supervisors
attached. Staff housing would be provided for the director of the
training center, the hotel manager, the school principal and the
head student supervisor.
3.09       Each training center would function year-round and would
have accommodation for 325 students. Courses in the basic program
would include introductory adaptation courses, language training,
technical training in the hotel school and actual service in the
practice hotel. Students would move as a group through all class-
room and practical phases of the training with one teacher assigned
to the group. Courses would be offered at each center in accounting
and control; reception and front office; housekeeping, linen and
laundry; restaurant and bar; kitchen; and storekeeping. As a result
of the intensive nature of the new curricula and flexible methods
of scheduling (Chart 2), training periods under the proposed program
would range from 9 to 11 months - as against the 24 months required
under current programs.
3.10       There will be an adequate pool of potential students for
the proposed training centers. At present the employment market is
such that entrants at both pre-apprenticeship and craft levels
generally possess higher educational qualifications than those
demanded. Depending upon the year, some 10,000 to 20,000 school
leavers with 3 to 7 years of secondary education are likely to be
available each year compared with about 2,800 places to be filled
in the hotel training system upon completion of the project.



3.11       In order to consolidate and rationalize the hotel
training system countrywide, the Tunisian authorities plan to apply
the curricula and teaching methods for the project institutions to
all hotel schools run by ONTT. Existing schools will adopt the new
curricula and teaching methods as they are developed under the tech-
nical assistance program. In addition, the proposed hotel centers
are expected to include some sections for students from other hotel
training schools which do not have a practice hotel.
3.12       The following table summarizes projected output of level
IV staff, with and without the project. It does not include the
output of the apprenticeship program (which is currently 300-400
students annually). OTTEEFP would adjust its output of hotel appren-
tices as necessary to complement the output from ONTT schools and its
apprenticeship program would focus attention on developing a sound
program for hotel maintenance staff (para. 3.24).

3.13       As stated above (para. 2.15), students are granted a
diploma (certificat d'aptitude professionnelle) on successful com-
pletion of a training course, buit the diplomas have no legal recog-
nition. During negotiations, assurances were given that within one
year of the date of the proposed loan, the necessary measures would
be taken to ensure legal recognition of diplomas issued by hotel
schools. Annex VIII provides information on the material to be
covered by the proposed legislation.



-9-
Part B. Technical Assistance
3.14       A technical assistance program is essential for the
success of the project. It wou'Ld comprise two sections, each to
be housed at the Institute.
3.15       The first section of the technical assistance program
provides for the detailed planning of the new courses (e.g. defi-
nition of curricula, course outlines, textbooks) and their intro-
duction into existing and new schools. This would be the res-
ponsibility of a hotel training expert appointed for two years as
team leader ("Chief of Program Planning") supported by two experts
in hotel training for 18 months each, to give a total of 60 man-
months of expatriate technical assistance. The Director of the
Institute and his two assistants would work closely with the three
expatriate experts as Tunisian counterparts. These three experts
would be supported in their work by several Tunisian educational
planning experts for a total of 12 man-months.
3.16       The second section of the technical assistance program
would consist of teacher training (para. 3.18). The program would
be accomplished with the help of five technical experts each appointed
for a period of 18 man-months, to give a total of 90 man-months of
expatriate technical assistance. Five Tunisian staff would be
assigned to the teacher training experts as counterparts and would
become training inspectors at the end of the technical assistance
program.
3.17       Appointment of the Chief of Program Planning would be
made with the approval of the Bank by January 1, 1975. The other
expatriate technical assistance appointmnents should be made con-
sistent with the schedule of technical assistance (Chart 3) and
would be subject to approval by the Bank. Details on suggested
qualifications for expatriate technical assistance experts are
given in Annex V.
3.18       The availability of teaching staff is vital to the success
of the proposed project. ONTT has agreed to create a hotel teacher
training section at the Institute to train teachers for the project
institutions. During negotiations , assurances were received that the
Tunisian Government would establish this school within six months of
the signing of the proposed loan.
3.19       At present, the total full-time hotel and tourism teaching
strength is 49 whereas 231 will be required by 1978, 81 of them in
the three proposed training centers. The main sources of new teacher
recruitment for the new program will be: (a) those currently
employed as teachers; (b) experienced workers holding responsible
positions in the hotel industry; and (c) secondary school leavers
who have satisfactorily completed the baccalaureate. Accelerated



- 10 -
teacher training for a 4-month period would be given to those
presently teaching and to those recruited from the industry; those
rec:uited from secondary school would be required to follow 16 months
of training at the Institute plus 8-12 months practical experience in
hotels. Table 9, Annex III shows the scheduling of teacher training
with an output of 90 in 1976; and 120 in 1977, which allows an ade-
quace margin for attrition. Beyond 1977, teacher requirements would
be based on forecasts made by ONTT (para. 3.22). The Institute has
the flexibility of adjusting its teacher output by dividing its out-
put between teachers and supervisory staff.
3.20       Up until now, the private sector has attracted most of
the more qualified hotel staff and it has been difficult to hire
and retain competent teachers. Hotel employees in middle and higher
management positions, however, could be attracted to teaching in
sufficient numbers were conditions of employment to improve. To make
conditions in teaching competitive with the private sector, teaching
must be made attractive in status and salary. Assurances were received
during negotiations that ONTT would take the steps necessary to
establish the rights, obligations, salary and status of hotel teachers
(Annex VIII) within one year of the signing of the loan.
3.21       Details of the proposed teacher training scheme are given
in Annex III.
C. Institutional Arrangements,
Administration and Management
3.22       ONTT's Department of Tourism Training is at present
inadequately staffed to run the training system. The department
will be strengthened by reorganization (see chart, Annex VI) and by
the appointment of a Deputy Director in consultation with the Bank.
This appointment would be a condition of effectiveness of the pro-
posed Bank loan. The Deputy Director would supervise the work of
a Planning Unit, to be created within ONTT's Department of Tourism
Training, with specific responsibility for establishing the number
of teachers required and students to be trained.
3.23       It is important for the success of the project that the
private sector be involved in training. The Tunisian authorities
have agreed to take the steps necessary for creating a National
Council for Tourism Training which would advise ONTT on all policy
matters related to the training of hotel staff, such as recruitment
and placement of students, course content, and in general terms on
how to adjust the output of the training system to the needs of the
hotel industry. The Council would be composed of representatives
of ONTT, the hotel industry and other interested public and private
bodies. Similar functions would be carried out for the training
centers by an advisory board to be created for each center. One
member of each advisory board would sit on the National Council.



- il -
Assurances were received during negotiations that a National Council
would be established within one year of the signing of the proposed
loan and that an advisory board would be formed for each of the
hotel training centers (Annex VIII), six months in advance of its
opening date.
3.24       Although an important: aspect of hotel training, the training
of hotel maintenance personnel has not been included in the project
because it would be more properly given in industrial vocational
schools where demonstration and practice equipment is available.
OTTEEFP which already administers the hotel apprenticeship scheme
is willing and capable of training maintenance personnel. Assurances
were received during negotiations that arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank to train hotel maintenance personnel under the direction of
OTTEEFP would be made within one year of the signing of the loan.
3.25       The training centers would be managed in a decentralized
fashion. Each center would have separate administration and would
have capital and operating budgets approved by ONTT and included as
part of ONTT's annual budget.  Administration of each of the three
proposed training centers would be entrusted to three individuals:
a director; a hotel manager; and a hotel school principal. Each
director, responsible for the overall operation of the center, would
be selected primarily for his administrative ability. Each practice
hotel manager would have severaL years experience as a hotel manager,
and preferably would undergo the accelerated teacher training program.
Each school principal would be selected from those currently teaching
and trained in the new method or would be a graduate of the full
teacher training program. The staffing table for a training center
is shown as Chart 4. Key staff are expected to be appointed at least
six months before the opening of each training center in order to
supervise preparation of the centers to receive students.
D. Project Cost
3.26       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.3
million equivalent. The breakdown by various categories of expen-
diture, given in Annex 1, is sumnmarized below:

3.27      Sufficient land (approximately 3.5 ha) is to be allocated
for each center but land has not been included as a cost of the
project.
3.28      Construction cost estimates before contingencies are derived
from functional and economical accommodation schedules and current
unit building costs; they average US$132 per square meter for academic
and boarding facilities at the hotel training schools and US$147 for
the practice hotels.
3.29      With regard to furniture and equipment, detailed lists
would be prepared during the building design stage and approved by
the Bank prior to procurement. Local currency cost estimates include
port, warehousing and handling charges, local taxes and transportation
to sites, which together are equivalent to about 25% of the c.i.f.
prices.
3.30      The project cost includes contingency allowances for:
(a) price increases estimated at an average of 10% per annum; and
(b) unforeseen factors equal to 10% of the estimated cost of site
development, construction, furniture and equipment (Annex 1, Table 4).
The 10% increase in building prices (higher than the overall rate of
inflation) reflects cost increases experienced in the residential
and hotel construction industry in Tunisia during 1973. The contin-
gencies include an allowance for unforeseen events deriving from the
energy crisis but they do not cover "special risks" that may be
associated with the implementation of the project. All contingencies
account for 26.3% of total project cost, and 35.6% of the base line
costs.
3.31      Estimated costs per student place at the hotel training
schools, excluding contingency allowances and architectural services,
are as follows:

a/ Includes furnishings, linen, lamps, telephones, etc.
3.32       The overall cost of the project per full time student place
is US$12,615 (including contingencies). This cost is reasonable compared
with costs for hotel training centers in other countries (Annex I, Table II).
The per room hotel construction cost is in line with current construction
costs in Tunisia.
E. Financing Plan
3.33       The total project cost is US$12.3 million equivalent of
which it is proposed that the Bank would finance US$5.6 million. equal
to the foreign exchange component. The balance of the funds required
to finance the project would be provided by the Government as budgetary
allocations to ONTT and would include local costs of the project
estimated at US$6.7 million, land acquisition costs and interest
during construction. During negotiations, assurances were received
that these costs and any cost overruns would be met by the Government.



- 15 -
3.34       The total cost of the technical assistance program is esti-
mated at US$500,000 equivalent. At the time of appraisal it was not
known if any part of it would be provided by bilateral or multilateral
sources. The Tunisians were asked to identify potential sources of
financing by the time of negotiations. During negotiations, the Tunisians
expressed a preference for multilateral financing of the technical assis-
tance.  UNDP financing was unavailable from the Indicative Planning Figure
through 1976. No other suitable source of funding for the technical
assistance has been found and it is therefore recommended that the Bank
finance this component of the project. The Tunisians would retain experts
(possibly ILO) on conditions satisfactory to the Bank to carry out the
technical assistance component.
3.35       The practice hotels would generate income but the mission
estimated that they would only be able to cover operating costs because
of the administrative and staff structure necessary for pedagogic reasons
(Annex I, Table 10). The objective of the hotels is educational rather
than commercial and it is unlikely that they could cover financial
charges. The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan should therefore be
granted to ONTT rather than on-lent.
4. IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Project Implementation
4.01       A project unit (or Direction des Travaux) was established
within ONTT to direct and coordinate the implementation of the tourism
infrastructure project. For the execution of the hotel training
project, the Direction des Travaux would be entrusted with additional
powers and authority and would be responsible inter alia for: (a) the
coordination of the architectural services of the hotel training project,
including the review of all designs for works to be carried out under
the project and their submission to the Bank for approval; (b) the pre-
paration of master lists and specifications of furniture and equipment;
(c) the preparation of bidding and contract documents and the evaluation
of bids for the hotel training project; (d) the overall supervision of
construction and procurement; (e) the coordination with Government
ministries and other agencies concerned with the physical execution of
the project; and (f) preparation of quarterly progress reports to
the Batnk.
4.02       For the execution of the hotel training project, the Direction
des Travaux would designate a full-time project architect/engineer. In
addition, three field technical assistants and three field construction
supervisors would be assigned to each project component during the con-
struction period. The Direction des Travaux would provide the part-time
services of its accountant and procurement officer. The administrative



- 16 -
costs attributable to the hotel training project would be determined on
the basis of separate accounts for administrative expenditures to be
kept within the Direction des Travaux. The total cost of project
administration (US$270,000) includes the salaries for the full-time
and part-time staff, the cost of equipment and vehicles, and the fees
of the firm responsible for the technical supervision of the construction.
B. Professional Services
4.03       Consulting architects would be retained by ONTT for the
design and physical development of the hotel schools and should be
acceptable to the Bank. Appointment of the consulting architects would
be a condition of effectiveness.
C. Procurement
4.04       Building contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding to pre-qualified contractors in accordance
with Bank guidelines.  It is expected, however, that the contracts
would be awarded to Tunisian firms as the country has a competitive
construction industry capable of carrying out the proposed project.
Local competitive bidding subject to Bank approval would be used for
small construction contracts, the value of each such contract is esti-
mated not to exceed US$100,000.
4.05       Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Preferred domestic manufacturers would be accorded
a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of competing imports
or the rate of customs duty applicable, whichever is the lower. It is
expected that all furniture contracts would be won by local manufacturers
and most equipment contracts by foreign manufacturers.
D. Maintenance
4.06       Assurances were received during negotiations that effective
procedures for regular maintenance of the project schools and hotels
by ONTT's Department of Programs would be established.
E. Diabursement
4.07       The proposed loan of US$5.6 million would be equivalent to
approximately 46% of the total project cost and would finance the esti-
mated foreign exchange component of the project.  It would be disbursed
to meet:



- 17 -
a. 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported equipment and furniture and 35%
of the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured equipment and furniture;
b. 38% of the total cost of construction
and site development, this percentage
representing the average of the estimated
foreign exchange components;
c. 37% of the cost of project administration,
representing 100% of foreign exchange; and
d. 100% of the foreign exchange costs of
technical assistance specialties.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex I, Table 3.
F. Financial Aspects
4.08      Costs of operation of the hotel schools would be covered
in full by the Government, and, consistent with national policy, full-
time students would not be required to pay for their training. Board
and lodging would be provided by the Government and no tuition fees
would be assessed. Students would receive a monthly allowance during
their training in the school and wages for their work in the practice
hotel. Wages of students on refresher or upgrading courses would be
paid by employers.
4.09      In 1983, total costs of operation (Annex I, Table 9) are estimated
to be US$1.27 million equivalent (in 1974 prices). The net operating
cost per student is expected to be US$914 compared to an estimated
US$1,900 per student trained in 1974. Separate accounts should be
kept for the hotel school, student boarding and the practice hotels.
In the unlikely event that the hotels have operating losses, budgetary
funds would be made available to cover any shortfall. Any operating
surpluses from the hotels would accrue to ONTT. During negotiations,
assurances were received that an accounting system acceptable to the
Bank would be installed in each center, six months before its expected
opening. During negotiations, assurances were received that independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank would be appointed. Annual audited
financial statements would be submitted within four months at the end
of each fiscal year during the execution of the project and subsequently
during the operational phase.

5. JUSTIFICATION
5.01       The proposed loan would assist Tunisia to expand and
improve substantially its hotel training system. The physical com-
ponent of the project would provide three modern and efficient
facilities whose graduates, trained in a suitable educational environ-
ment, would meet 27% of the country's estimated 1983 requirements for
hotel personnel at level IV. The extension of carefully conceived new
curricula and teaching methods to both existing and proposed schools
under the technical assistance program would rationalize the country's
overall hotel training system. The halving of the training period in
existing schools would result in substantial cost reduction. At the
same time, the introduction of the proposed legislation regulating
the position of teachers, students and employees alike would give a
new status to the hotel profession. The proposed institutional
arrangements, particularly the creation of the National Council for
Tourism Training, would improve cooperation between the Government
and the private sector and would enable the training system to
respond quickly to the needs of the industry.
5.02       The impact of the project on the hotel industry would be
felt through higher standards of service, increased labor productivity
and reduction in mishandling of hotel equipment, leading to savings
in maintenance and operating costs. Improved hotel service would
also result in greater guest comfort and satisfaction and would have
favorable repercussions on repeat visitor traffic and on occupancy
levels; it would ultimately be instrumental in enhancing the image
of the country as a tourist destination.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01       During negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances
were obtained with respect to the following principal points:
a. Measures would be taken to ensure
within one year from the signing
of the loan:
i. legal recognition of diplomas issued
by hotel schools (para. 3.13); and
ii.  the rights, obligations, salary
and status of hotel teachers
(para. 3.20).
b. Appointment of Chief of Program Planning

APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
Tourism Sector
A. The Industry
1.       Centrally situated between the Eastern and Western basins of the
Mediterranean, Tunisia is the nearest point of the African continent to the
hub of the European tourist market in the London-Frankfurt-Paris triangle.
The country's 1,050 km of coastline has some of the finest beaches in the
Mediterranean and a pleasant climate prevailing for the greater part of the
year. Enhancing these natural tourist assets, evidence of Tunisia's cultu-
ral past abounds throughout the country: Phoenician ruins dating from the
period when Carthage was a major maritime power; Roman aqueducts, temples
ar.U coliseums; Byzantine-inspired mosques; Turkish fortifications along
the old Barbary coast; and in all Tunisian towns, ancient Arab "souks"
(markets) where a variety of imaginative handicrafts are offered. In the
1960's, the jet airplane brought Tunisia and its tourism assets within easy
reach of travellers from Western Europe (London, Paris and Frankfurt are
within 1,100 miles of Tunis), and a tourism boom developed, at first largely
confined to higher-income groups, but later, as charter flights and package
tours became popular, spreading increasingly to medîum income groups.
2.       The number of hotel beds increased from 3,950 in 1961 to about
55,900 at the end of 1973 -- concentrated mainly in the zones of Tunis, NabeuL-
Hammamet, Sousse-Skanes-Monastir and Djerba-Zarzis (Table 1). The increase in
average size of hotels from 56 beds in 1961 to 213 beds in 1973 has brought
economies of scale, while the change in the income group composition of
visitors has led to an increase in the proportion of medium class hotels
which now represent 657. of the accommodation capacity, as opposed to 10% for
first-class hotels. Some tourist villages have been built over the decade,
but their proportion remains at the low level of 16% of total bed capacity.
Supplemental accommodation (rooms in private homes, camping sites, etc.)
which make up a substantial share of other Mediterranean countries' tourism
supply, are generally lacking in Tunisia. Almost all the capacity in the
sector, representing an investment of TD 120 million over the decade, has
been financed and run by Tunisians (largely by the private sector), only
3% being financed by and 10% run by foreigners.
3.       Between 1961 and 1972, foreign visitor arrivals in Tunisia increased
at an annual rate of almost 30% from 46,000 to 780,000, a performance unmatched
by any other Mediterranean country (Table 2). This growth rate was tem-
porarily arrested in 1969 and 1970 when a combination of political factors,
floods and cholera slowed down the growth rate to a level of 11.5% per
annum, but it regained momentum in 1971 and 1972 when annual increases of



ANNEX II
Page 2
48% and 28% respectively were achieved. In 1973, due to new cases
of cholera and ill-timed price increases, a decrease in arrivals was
registered. International demand in terms of bednights expanded
more rapidly than visitor arrivals with foreign visitors' length of
stay increasing from 6.2 days in 1961 to 8.7 days in 1972. Because
of Tunisia's low per capita income, domestic tourism has grown much
more slowly and represented only 5% of total bednights in 1972. In
1972 Western Europe accounted for 83% of total arrivals, with Germany
(22%), France (20%) and the United Kingdom (18%) ranking in the top posi-
tions (Table 3). Over 80% of visitors' arrivals are by air, two-thirds by
charter flights to airports (Tunis-Carthage, Monastir, Djerba) close to
the tourist zones (Table 4). Over half of the arrivals are registered
during the June-September period. About 60% of visitors are vacationers
who come to Tunisia from Europe on inclusive tours covering transport-
ation, accommodation and meals. The Turnisian hotel industry has had to
standardize its services in order to adapt them to groups whose members
take their meals at the same time, have the same menu, and whose
relations with the front office are through travel agency employees.
As a consequence, Tunisian hotels, employ only 0.35 persons per bed,
onp f the lowest ratios in the world. The seasonality of the demand
results in overall low bed occupancy rates (around 40% in 1972, Table 1 and
Table 5) and in important seasonality of employment (over 30%).
4.       From 1965 through 1973, tourism was the single most important source
of foreign exchange ahead of petroleum and olive oil. The increase in
foreign visitors' bednights accompanied by an increase in average daily
spending from TD 4.6 in 1961 to TD 10 by 1970 resulted in an increase
of gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism from TD 1.5 million
(or 2.5% of current receipts) in 1961 to TD 68.4 million (or 22.1% of
current receipts) in 1972.  Net receipts from tourism expanded from
about 46% of gross receipts in 1964 to about 70% in 1972. Total direct
employment in the tourism sector was about 19,500 in 1973, of which
17,000 people were employed in hotels and the remainder in travel
agencies and transportation. Since about 50% of the handicraft pro-
duction is sold to tourists, the employment generated by the tourism
sector should be increased by 7,500 (half of the handicraft employees).
5.       The Government has taken an active part in the development
of the tourism sector.  At first the Government took the lead in pro-
viding hotels by building its own chain. Since 1965, however, private
enterprise has been responsible for 90% of hotel investment and the
Government's role through ONTT has been chiefly to promote Tunisian
tourism abroad, to offer incentives, to provide sites and infrastructure
and to train personnel. To promote Tunisia's image on the inter-
national tourism market, ONTT has supported the joint efforts of the
country's hotel industry and travel agencies by opening tourist bureaus
in several European capitals. ONTT's advertising and promotional
expenditures have amounted to at least US$ 1 million over each of the
last four years and represent 30% of its current budget.



ANNEX Il
Page 3
6.       Over the years, the Government has instituted a number of
incentives for tourism developmeni: including:
a.  outright payments (through ONTT) for minor infra-
structure, linking up hotel sites with the main
infrastructure;
b.  duty exemption for itiported materials required
for hotel construction;
c.  interest rebates on hotel loans of up to 3
percentage points on commercial interest
rates (which are at present around 9%); and
d.  a five-year exemption from the tax on profits.
This incentives system was established haphazardly and has a number of
weaknesses. In order to establish a more rational least cost system
which would achieve the objective of sustained flows of private
capital into hotel investments, and at the same time would avoid the
risk of misallocating resources, ONTT commissioned, with World Bank
assistance, a study of its incentives system, due for completion in
1974.
7.       In order to control tourism development and avoid land
speculation, in May 1973 the Government designated by decree, six
priority tourism development zones (Tunis North, Tunis South, Hammamet,
Sousse, Djerba and Zarzis). In addition, a Tourism Land Office ("Agence
Fonciere Touristique"), il in charge of acquiring land in the tourism
development zones and transferring it to hotel owners, was also esta-
blished by decree. The six priority zones contain about 65% of the
country's guest accommodations and receive more than 705/% of foreign
visitors. Infrastructure has generally lagged behind accommodation
supply especially with respect to roads, sewerage and water supply.
The Government has undertaken large infrastructure projects in these
zones with assistance from the World Bank Group and the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau.
8.       The Government is committed to continuous expansion of the
sector. The implementation of the Tourism Infrastructure Project
(Loan TUN-858 and Credit TUN-329) and the creation of the "Agence
Fonciere Touristique" have removed two of the bottlenecks restricting
growth in the sector. The target of the Fourth Plan (1973-1976) is
84,000 hotel beds by 1976, an annual rate of increase of 8,500 beds.
1/ Under a law enacted in April 1973 governing tourism, industrial
and housing zones, "Loi relative a l'amenagement des zones
touristiques, industrielles et d'habitation".



ANNEX II
Page 4
By the end of 1914, total capacity will reach 66,000 beds. If new
construction continues at the rate of 8,000 beds per annum, total
capacity at the end of 1976 would reach 82,000 beds. Such an accom-
modation build-up is realistie even though in the near term, Tunisia's
tourism performance is likely to be adversely affected by the economic
uncertainties in the major European countries brought about by con-
tinued high fuel prices. In the longer term, however, Tunisia's
tourism assets and its proximity to Europe will enable a sustained
growth of the sector and will support the projected increases in
accommodation capacity.
B. Hotel Employment and Manpower Projections
9.       During the summer of 1973 a comprehensive survey of employ-
ment in the tourism industry in Tunisia was carried out bv the ILO.
Total accommodation in the country was 48,830 beds and se.ctoral
employment was 19,500 people of which 17,000 worked in h'otels, the
remainder working as guides, bus drivers, hostesses or in travel
agencies. These figures indicate an overall employee per bed ratio
of 0.400 for the tourism sector and of 0.349 for the hotels. The
ratio is equal to 0.242 for category I hotels (two stars and below)
0.382 for category II hotels (three stars) and 0.527 for category I
(four stars and luxury). This latter figure has to be compared with
ratios computed by Horwath and Horwath International for category I
hotels: worldwide average of 0.63 employee per bed, but 1.133 in
Asia and 0.867 in Africa. The seasonality of hotel employment was
30%.
10.      Of the hotel employees, 46% worked in the kitchen, bar and
restaurant and 36% in the front office and in housekeeping. Two-
thirds of the manpower was at level IV or above and 46% in level IV
positions. The personnel was generally young with one-third under
22 years old and only 5% over 50 years. Women accounted for 15%
and foreigners for less than 2% of the work force. Only 17% of
hotel employees had been trained in Tunisia or abroad. About 90%
of the hotel employment is concentrated in the zones of Tunis; Nabeul-
Hammamet, Sousse-Skanes-Monastir, and Djerba-Zarzis; the zones of
Sousse-Skanes, Monastir and Tunis with their higher class hotels
have a higher employee per bed ratio than Nabeul-Hammamet or Djerba-
Zarzis.

100.0               100.0
11.      Projections of manpower requirements at level IV have been
made for the years 1974-1983 (see Table 6). Annual additions to
accommodation beyond 1974, have been assumed equal to 8,000 beds, the
rate achieved in 1973 (8,114), but lower than the rate anticipated
for 1974 (10,550 beds) which is exceptionally high. Total capacity
in 1983 would be 130,000 beds of which over 105,000 would be located
in the zones of Tunis; Nabeul-Hammamet, Sousse-Skanes-Monastir and
Djerba-Zarzis whose maximum capacity has been estimated at 174,000
beds. 1/ The manpower needs are projected on the basis that each
new bed creates .350 hotel jobs and .208 jobs at level IV and that
the annual drop-out rate from the profession (because of emigration,
retirement) would equal 8% of the work force. The industry needs of
level IV personnel would increase from 9,400 in 1974 to 25,000 in
1983.  About 30% of the new jobs will be created in the Nabeul-Haummamet
zone, about 25% in the Sousse-Skanes-Monastir zone, and about 15% in
Djerba-Zarzis and 12% in Tunis.  Annual requirements of level IV
personnel would increase from 2,400 in 1975 to 3,800 in 1983.  The
output of the training system would satisfy only 14% of the require-
ments in 1974, 74% in 1979 and would drop steadily afterwards to 64%
in 1983. In 1975, only 16% of the level IV employees would have been
trained in the hotel schools, this proportion would increase to 49%
in 1983. The remaining 51% (13,600 persons) would have had the
opportunity at least once to attend refresher classes or upgrading
courses.

TUNIISIA
APPRAISAL OF A HOl'EL TRAINING PROJECT
Tourism Training in Tunisia
A.. Existing System
1.       Hotel and tourism training in Tunisia is carried out by two
agencies.  The apprenticeship program (level V employees, see Chart 1)
is conducted by the OTTEEFP; all other training (level II, III and
IV) is conducted by ONTT. Since 1964, the total output of the training
system has been over 3,600 graduates (end of 1972), as is shown in
Table 1. In addition to this, since 1958 about 1,300 students have
been sent abroad for training under a scholarship program.
2.       Vocational training in the tourism industry is financed in
part by the hotel industry through wages to apprentices and students
getting mandatory practical experience; in part by a tax on wages
of 2% (estimated at 150,000 dinars in 1973) the proceeds of which go
to the Government's general budget; and in part by Governnent's
budgetary allocations to ONTT and OTTEEFP.
(i)  The Apprenticeship Program
3.       The OTTEEFP, which is under the aegis of the Ministry of
Social Affairs, has been authorized to administer apprenticeship
programs since 1967. Training of hotel apprentices began in 1970 and
since then 1,451 apprentices have graduated; over 90% of these graduates
have found work in hotels.
4.       The programs are divided into two parts.  The first part, or
apprenticeship, consists of eight months training in one of 30 sections
in 8 geographically dispersed centers. It is designed for those with
a completed primary education and is open to those with up to two
completed years of secondary education (ages 14 to 18). Classes consist
of 40 students each with one teacher responsible for all aspects of
training.  A typical week's program includes:
French    - 5 hours       Savoir Vivre         - 3 hours
German    - 3   "         Govertnment          - 2
English   - 3   "         Arithmetic           - 5
History   - 2   "         Hotel Organization - 1 hour
Geography - 3   "         Physical Education - 3 hours
30 hours



ANNEX III
Page 2
The second part of the program, the apprenticeship itself, is carried
out in cooperating hotels where students are placed by the OTTEEFP
under the guidance of counsellors who follow each apprenticels progress.
The length of the apprenticeship and the wages paid vary according to
specialty and seniority:
Length of                      Monthly Wages
Apprenticeship            With Bed/Board   Meals only
Housekeeping            1 year                    8 dinars      13 dinars
Restaurant & Bar        2          (lst yr.)      8   rr        13   "
(2nd yr.)    12   "         17

(2nd yr.)    12             17
(3rd yr.)    16  r'         21
5.       The system currently has capacity for 1,200 students and this
ip to be augmented to 1,600 under the Fourth Plan. Two new centers in
Rades and Kharouba are planned. However, several problems have been
encountered, notably a shortage of teachers and counsellors which has
resulted in severe understaffing; inconsistencies in program content;
and a lack of suitable facilities and equipment.
(ii) Hotel Training (Middle Level)
6.       ONTT, which is under the aegis of the Ministry of the
National Economy, is responsible for training all hotel staff other
than those trained by OTTEEFP. The system which has evolved is based
on the French system but has been modified as a result of the influence
of bilateral technical assistance programs from several countries
including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.
7.       At the end of 1973, there were seven hotel schools in Tunisia
with a total capacity of 1,050 students and an annual output of 450.
Two schools, La Marsa and Sidi Dhrif, with a combined capacity of
140 students are to be closed because they operate under adverse
conditions; and two new schools at Nabeul and Djerba are presently
under construction. Six of the present schools train students for
entry into the industry at level IV; the seventh school (the Institute)
discussed separately in the following section, trains students for
entry into industry at level II.
8.       Most of the schools function in converted buildings (old
barracks, private villas) which are ill-suited for modern hotel
training. The equipment in use, with one notable exception, is
insufficient and inadequate for training purposes.
9.       The basic system is to provide training spread over two years



ANNEX III
Page 3
of technical instruction in school and practical experience in hotels.
The technical training includes general knowledge, language training
and vocational education in one of several industry specialties
(hotel reception, housekeeping, restaurant and bar, kitchen, maintenance,
hostesses); see Tables 2 and 3. Experience with techniques learned
is provided at the hotel school by using students' housing, restaurants
and production kitchens (and the students themselves) as laboratories.
This formal school training is complemented by two summer periods
spent working in hotels, for which students are paid wages as trainees.
10.      Recruitment of students takes places in the period December
to March and the school year runs from April to March. About 80% of
students are men and 20% women and they are selected on the basis of
scholastic achievement and a personal interview. Students are accepted
from the ages of 17 to 21 and the minimum academic requirements for
acceptance to a program are as follows:
Years of Secondary
Specialty             Education Completed
Housekeeping                    1
Kitchen                         3
Restaurant                      3
Hostesses                       5
Reception                       6
11.      These entry standards in fact are often exceeded and students
accepted into programs may be over-educated given the level of job
they are being trained for. There has been a high drop-out rate
at the end of the first year in some specialties and the two-year
program seems excessively long since (a) students have a high
secondary educational standard on entering hotel school, and (b)
some of the material repeats that already learned in secondary school.
In addition, the technical skills taught at the hotel schools at level
IV can be mastered in a shorter period.
12.      There are four main complaints leveled against the hotel
training system. Firstly, neither the schools nor the teachers have
the benefit of legal status. Secondly, as a result of physical con-
ditions, the system is somewhat "inbred". Students act as guests;
student housing is used as practice hotel space; kitchens and res-
taurants serve double roles as laboratories for training and as pro-
duction and service units. This is contrary to current professional
opinion which holds that hotel schools should correspond as nearly as
possible to conditions in industry. Thirdly, as a result of the
rapid growth of the hotel industry in Tunisia, the training system is



ANNEX III
Page 4
incapable of training enough employees to meet the demand and there
remains in the industry a backlog of some 15,000 employees who have no
training other than on the job. Finally, the present curricula are
inconsistent with the requirements of the hotel industry. The two-
year curricula are too long for the job skills to be taught (Tables 2
and 3); in some cases the emphasis is on training which should be given
in the general education system and not àt specialized trade schools.
13.      The projections of hotel school places and student output are
presented in the annex (Annex VII) on the proposed new system since
projections for the existing and new schools are interrelated. Costs
of operation for the ONTT operated schools are shown in Table 4.
(iii) Hotel and Tourism Training (Higher Level)
14.      ONTT is responsible for administration of the Institute at
Monastir (Institut Superieur de Tourisme et d'Hotellerie, ISTH) which
trains hotel and tourism staff for entry into industry at level II.
The Institute was set up with UNDP assistance in 1969. UNDP's contri-
bution is $1.2 million composed of experts, scholarships and equipment.
This assistance terminates in April 1974. The Institute is presently
hcsed in an old rented hotel at Monastir but will move to permanent
headquarters presently under construction at Sidi Dhrif (in the
suburbs, north of Tunis) by October, 1975 (see section B, below).
15.      The Institute's main objective at present is the training of
level Il staff for hotels and other tourism enterprises but it will
take on increased responsibility after the Institute moves to Sidi
Dhrif. It has a capacity of 150 student places and the facilities are
in poor condition.
16.      Recruitment of students, administered by ONTT, takes place
in the period July to September, and the school year runs from October
to July, the same as the school year prescribed by the Ministry of
National Education. Students are accepted between the ages of 18 and
23 based on their scholastic background and a personal interview. The
minimum educational level for acceptance into the Institute is usually
the completed baccalaureate, except for maintenance students where a
technical education (brevet de technicien) is demanded. During their
training period, students receive a monthly allowance of 10 dinars
(maintenance students receive 30 dinars living out).
17.      The programs offered are residential and of two years duration
including a period ("stage") during summer spent working in an opera-
tional hotel. Courses (Tables 2 and 5) cover traditional hotel material
and in addition courses in hotel maintenance and tourism subjects are
offered. The programs of the Institute are well conceived but somewhat
unbalanced in places and students are readily absorbed into the hotel
industry. The tourism courses are offered in alternate years since
the demand is relatively light. The maintenance courses in effect
train "in charge" engineers and as such are acceptable at the Institute
although it is questionable whether equipment maintenance staff should
be taught in hotel schools rather than in industrial vocational schools.



ANNEX III
Page 5
18.      The projections of the Institutels places and student output
are presented in the annex (Annex VII) on the proposed new system
since projections for the existing Institute at Monastir and the new
quarters at Sidi Dhrif are interrelated. Costs of operation of the
hotel training system are shown in Table 4.
(iv) The Teaching Body
19.      The hotel schools rely on outside teachers for general
subjects and for languages. These teachers usually hold chairs at
Ministry of Education Schools or at the Bourguiba School of Languages.
Beyond that, full-time hotel school teachers numbered 49 in 1973.
20.      Statistics summarizing the teaching faculty are shown in
Table 6. Most of the faculty was recruited between 1970 and 1972 by
the Tourism Training Department of ONTT. Prospective teachers are
identified by the Training Department and given an "ad hoc" training
program which usually involves a period in a foreign hotel school and
practical experience in a foreign hotel. However, it has been diffi-
cult in the past to recruit candidates with experience because salary
levels are not competitive with those offered by the private sector.
In consequence, the turnover has been quite high and attracting
enough high caliber teachers has been a problem.
B. The Proposed System
21.      Tourism training will continue to be carried out by ONTT
and OTTEEFP. Working closely with ONTT, OTTEEFP will adjust its out-
put of hotel apprentices in hotel specialties according to the require-
ments of the industry and will focus attention on developing a solid
program for hotel maintenance staff. ONTT will continue to provide
training at level Il, III and IV. Level Il requirements will be met
at the Higher Institute for Tourism and Hotelkeeping; levels III and
IV will be met by the proposed project's institutions and other
existing hotel schools.
(i) Hotel Training (Middle Level)
22.      Courses for middle level training would be developed under
the technical assistance program.
23.      The proposed system is designed to reproduce as closely as
possible the working environment found in hotels and other tourism
related facilities. Training centers, composed of conventional hotel
educational facilities ("hotel schools") plus practice facilities
operated commercially (hotels, restaurants), would be located in
tourism zones and operated year round. Students would receive
theoretical training in the school section and practical experience
in the practice facility, including experience of the vagaries of
the hotel industry such as working on Sundays and holidays, split



ANNEX III
Page 6
shifts, and marked seasonality. Students would live at the training
centers. Each center would function autonomously within prescribed
budgetary limits and the involvement of hotelkeepers and those in the
industry would be encouraged through, for example, representation on
an advisory committee, participation in the selection and recruitment
of students, and even through teaching in the schools.
24.      The training system would prepare students to work in one
type of job. They would be recruited four times annually with courses
staggered to permit efficient use of facilities. Selection of students
would be made by the staff of each center assisted by representatives
of ONTT and hotelmen. Entry level would vary from a completed third
year of secondary education for chambermaids to the baccalaureate for
reception and front office students. The length of study would vary
depending on the course. Full-time courses would last up to one year
of study (Tables 7 and 8). Refresher courses would last three weeks
and students would be released-froma work but at their employer's
expense to attend these courses. At the end of their course of study
(except in the case of refresher students) students would be assisted
b7 the training center to find employment.
25.      Some of the schools do not have the facilities to employ the
practice facility concept. However, the new schools at Nabeul and
Djerba will both have practice restaurants and kitchens. In addition,
ONTT has a capital budget for replacing equipment and expanding
facilities at some of the existing schools which includes practice
facilities. The real problem will be finding practice facilities for
housekeeping students but since nunibers are small the suggested solution
is to transport these groups to the three centers proposed for the
project.
(ii)  Hotel and Tourism Training (Higher Level)
26.      The Institute will move from Monastir to Sidi Dhrif by
October, 1975. The timing is important for the proposed project since
the Institute is expected to train teachers and also house the tech-
nical assistance teams and provide the technical leadership for the
training system.
27.      The site of the Institute is a ten-acre tract on a hill
near Sidi Bou Said overlooking La Marsa. The Institute will cost in
excess of US$ 2.1 million equivalent when completed and the buildings
will cover about 10,000 square meters. They will include a hotel
school with 300 student places (compared to 150 at Monastir), student
and staff housing and a practice hotel.
28.      As the key element in the Tunisian hotel training scheme, the
Institute will have four main ultimate objectives:
a. training of level II and levelI staff for
hotels and other tourism enterprises;



ANNEX III
Page 7
b. teacher training;
c. organization of management seminars; and
d. research and development.
29.      The teaching program will undergo review but in content it
is expected that the same disciplines will be taught as at Monastir.
The diploma currently being awarded is signed by the Director General
of ONTT but approval to grant a higher technical diploma (diplome de
Technicien Superieur) approved by the Ministry of National Education
is expected shortly.
30.      The other important element of the Institute's program is
the teacher training program.
(iii) Teacher Training
31.      It will be a condition of loan that a teacher training
department be established within the Institute when it opens in 1975.
To ensure effective cooperation between the Director of the Institute
and the Director of Program Planning responsible for implementing the
new concept in hotel training, it is recommended that these two posts
should be filled as from the beginning of January, 1975. Experts
who are to assist in the teachers' training program should be appointed
as from the beginning of July, 1975.
32.      It is considered that the main sources of teachers' recruit-
ment will be:
a.  those currently employed as teachers;
b.  experienced workers holding responsible positions
in the hotel industry; and
c.  secondary school leavers who have satisfactorily
completed the full seven-year course secondary
education.
For the first of these groups, a four-month course in the theory and
practice of teaching with special reference to the new training concept
is considered suitable. For the second group, the four-month course
in the theory and practice of teaching should be preceded by a normal
training course of one year's duration at technician level (level II)
and a period, preferably of not less than one year, in the hotel
industry.
33.      It is clear that a very tight program is involved and that
heavy dependence must be placed on the Government's ability to recruit
suitable candidates from industry.  To this end, teaching must be made



ANNEX III
Page 8
attractive both in status and in salary and generous recognition of
industrial experience must be given in the matter of scale increments.
34.      For the industrial recruits it is considered that groups of
thirty be established to be divided into half-groups for practical
work. Starting in October 1975, and allowing a gap of one month
between courses, it should be possible to train not less than 150
before the opening of the new schools in January 1978 (Table 9).
Among these should be a small number of the existing 49 teachers who
would be in a position to hold responsible posts on return to their
own schools.
35.      Secondary school leavers intended for the teaching service
should be recruited in groups of 30 in January 1975 and 1976. By
reducing the period spent by the second group in the hotel industry
from twelve to eight months, a further 60 teachers would be available
by January 1978 or earlier.
36.      It is recommended that both types of recruits should be placed
on the appropriate points of the teachers' salary scales from the
beginning of the four-month pedagogic training.

APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
The Education Sector
A. The Present System
1.       The present educational system, patterned largely upon
that of France, has resulted from a series of changes initiated
from the gaining of independence in 1956. It provides for six
years of primary education from the age of six followed by
secondary education extending over three or seven years. Upon
completion of primary education the pupil may enter either upon
a three-year course (enseignement secondaire industriel) leading
to a craft qualification or upon a seven-year course leading
eventually to the baccalaureate in a number of specializations
(see chart); the first three years of the "long" course are common
to all students.
2.       In 1972, 23% of pupils leaving primary education were
able to enter the secondary system, approximately two-thirds for
the "long" courses and one-third for the shorter or craft courses.
Of those entering the "long" courses, some 30% follow technically-
oriented courses, 40% mathematical and science courses, 20% arts
courses and 10% business studies. The number of students who
cease attendance before completion of the seven years course is
high, especially at the end of the common three-year
course (20%/).
3.       The university provides courses normally of four to seven
years duration according to the requirements of the several faculties.
The total enrolment of some 10,000 students is to be compared with
some 180,000 in secondary education, and some 900,000 in primary
education.
4.       In addition to the Ministry of National Education with
responsibility for primary, secondary and university education as
defined above, the Ministry of Agriculture organizes lower and
upper secondary-level courses for field officers, technical
assistants, teachers and farm managers, and higher level diploma
courses for agricultural engineers and others; the Ministry of
Social Affairs is concerned with vocational training at a variety
of levels including pre-apprenticeship and upgrading courses,



ANNEX IV
Page 2
accelerated training courses for adults and the supervision of
practical work in pilot primary schools; and a number of other
ministries, including ONTT, which organize their own special
training courses.
B.  Educational Development Strategy
5.       The Government aims to improve the present rate of
primary scholarization (about 74% currently) partly by increased
provision for girls and partly by effecting reduction in the drop-
out rate. It is expected that the present disparity between boy
and girl enrolments (59 to 41%) will have been corrected by 1980
and that the partial substitution of automatic promotion between
grades in place of repetition and rejection will bring about a
further improvement in the scholarization rate. Practical sub-
jects are to be introduced into the curriculum (pilot schemes
are already in operation) with the irntention of making the school
course a preparation not only for pupils entering the secondary
system but for the much greater numbers for whom the primary
school marks the end of the formal educative process.
6.       In secondary education the intention is to make all "long"
courses of seven years duration (at present the technical, industrial
and business courses are of six years duration only) and to dis-
continue courses in administration and economics. All courses
are based on a common first three years of study followed by a
fourth year in one of three departments (arts, mathematics/science,
or technical). In the ensuing years, various options are available
within each department. The baccalaureate awarded at the end of
each course is required for university entrance.
7.       At a lower level, secondary vocational courses offer
three years of training for students entering industry as craftsmen
with opportunities for better students to proceed to technician
courses. These courses are to continue but courses at a similar
level for commercial students are being discontinued as were,
some few years ago, parallel courses in general education.
8.       Following projected changes in primary education, it is
hoped to raise the percentage of successful candidates for entry
to the first year of secondary education to 30% of those completing
the sixth year of primary education from a present 35,000 to
59,000 by 1981.
C.  Projected "Drop-outs"
9.       The "output" of schools in the secondary education system
are shown in Table 1.



ANNEX IV

D. Educational Finance
10.      Total public expenditure on education in Tunisia was
estimated at about TD 72.6 million in the school year 1971/72.
The Ministry of Education was responsible for 94% of this total;
the Ministry of Agriculture and ONTT for 4% for vocational programs;
and OTTEEFP for the remainder for its apprenticeship program. Total
expenditures for education represented 8.5% of GNP and 33% of total
central Government expenditures up from 3.8% and 17% respectively
in 1966. These figures reflect the rapid expansion of the education
system caused by the rapid population growth and the commitment
made by the Government in 1958 to achieve universal primary enrol-
ment in 1966/67, an objective not yet realized.
11.      Recurrent expenditures on education were estimated at
TD 62.8 million in 1971/72. About 93% of this was spent by the
Ministry of Education, 5% by the Ministry of Agriculture and the
remainder by ONTT and OTTEEFP. As a result of the expansion of
the education system, recurrent expenditures have multiplied
fourfold between 1962 and 1972, and their share of central Govern-
ment current expenditure has increased from 21% to 36%.
12.      Capital expenditure on education was estimated at TD 9.8
million in 1971/72, almost completely incurred by the Ministry of
Education. Capital expenditures by the Ministry of Education have
decreased to 12% of central Government expenditures since 1969
when they amounted to TD 10.9 million (15%) of central Government
expenditures. This evolution might reflect a recent policy whereby
construction of secondary schools has been transferred to local
communities.

NOTE:     The term "drop-out" covers pupils who either leave the school before the completion of seven years of study or who transfer from one course to another.  These
transfers, following upon the termination of certain courses and the recent addition of a seventh year of study for Technical/Industrial courses and for
Business Studies as from 1976-77, are largely responsible for the irregularities in the table and for the apparent negative drop-outs shown in ( ).

APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme (ONTT)
1.       ONTT was formally established in July 1971 (Decree No. 71 264).
It took the place of the short-lived Ministry of Tourism and Regional
Development. This change of status had important advantages because
it placed the Tunisian Government tourist organization on a semi-
autonomous basis, with the power to manage its own finances,
contract loans, make payments and hire personnel outside the res-
trictions of a Govertnment department. The Office was placed under
the supervision of the Ministry of National Economy. Apart from
the above changes, the Office largely carries out the functions of
the former Commissariat General au Tourisme et au Thermalisme
which had been the principal authority for the promotion and develop-
ment of tourism in Tunisia until the formation of the Ministry of
Tourism in 1969.
2.       The functions of ONTT may be summarized as follows:
a.  to formulate and implement the policies of
the Government in tourism and thermalism
within the framework of the plan of economic
and social development formulated by the
Ministry of Planning;
b.  to promote the development and equipment of
zones of tourism and thermal interest;
c.  to be responsible for implementing the
regulations affecting public and private
interests in those fields;
d.  to provide all forms of assistance to those
engaged in tourism development;
e.  to provide tourism training;
f.  to coordinate and promote tourism development
with public and private bodies, including
construction, management, publicity and
the organization of exhibitions; and
g.  administer the incentives system.



ANNEX VI
Page 2
3.       The Board of Directors of ONTT (which meets monthly) is
chaired by the Minister of National Economy and has six directors
appointed by the chairman in consultation with the Minister of
Finance; six directors chosen by him for their competence in the
field of tourism; and the Director General of the ONTT (also nomi-
nated by him) who presides the Minister's absence. The present
Director General, Mr. Bouraoui, has just taken over from Mr. Azzabi,
who had been the head of ONTT since its creation and is responsible
for its day-to-day administration. The Office, under a very competent
team, was strengthened in order to carry out the Tourism Infrastructure
Project (Loan No. 858-TUN and Credit No. 329-TUN) and is adequate to
implement the training project subject to the appointments foreseen
for the project.
l/
4.       ONTT is largely financed from the national budget through the
Ministry of National Economy.  The organization, under the general
supervision of the Minister, is empowered to contract loans, to
participate in tourist enterprises, and to pay expenses incurred from
its own bank accounts. It handles the state's aid to tourist enter-
prises; it contracts out, supervises and pays for the small infra-
structure works ("branchements") undertaken in cooperation with the
appropriate agencies to link hotels to the main infrastructure (water,
telecommunications, electricity and roads). All hotel projects in
Tunisia are subject to ONTT regulation and approval, working within
the framework of the Interdepartmental Tourism Commission. 2/ ONTT
is also responsible for setting up, administering and financing the
Government tourist offices abroad, undertaking tourist promotion and
for the Government tourism training programs. The Government hotel,
restaurant and transport chain, Societe Hoteliere et Touristique
Tunisienne (SHTT) is under ONTT supervision.
5.       The organization of ONTT (see attached chart) is divided
into five directorates plus the regional offices covering programs
(all technical and infrastructural work of development prior to the
operation of hotels), operations (statistics, inspection of hotel
projects, study of hotel operations, etc.), promotion (publicity at
home and abroad), administration and finance, and training. Organization
of the tourism training department is shown on the attached organi-
zational chart. The coordination and implementation of the Tourism
1/ The principal sources of funds for ONTT, other than the national
budget, are the rental of the Tunis Hilton Hotel, earnings from
the SHTT chain and Equipment Bonds (Bons d'Equipement).
2/  This Commission meets twice monthly to approve hotel projects
under the Code d'Investissements, usually under the chairmanship
of the Director General of ONTT, representing the Minister of
National Economy.



ANNEX VI
Page 3
Infrastructure Project is carried out by a "Direction des Travaux"
which reports directly to the Director General. This unit would
be expanded to undertake the hotel training project. The ONTT
organization benefits from the assistance of a number of expatriate
advisers in the fields of tourism, physical planning and engineering.

TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF A HOTEL TRAINING PROJECT
Outline of Administrative and Legal Steps to be taken
A. Introduction
1.       There are certain administrative and legal procedures which
are necessary if an integrated, national tourism training scheme is
to be achieved in Tunisia. These are recommended in substance in the
ILO preparation report and-refer t:o the entire approach to tourism
training. Specifically the important points are the following:
a. establishing the legal status of teachers;
b. certification of student diplomas;
c. creation of a national council
for tourism training; and
d.  creation of a trainirg program for hotel
maintenance staff.
2.       ONTT has already started`preparation of these items and
progress has been made, particularly concerning the question of
recognition of the status of teachers. As work proceeds, ONTT should
work with the appropriate ministries and institutions involved, 1/
and should also confer with ILO which has already offered its assis-
tance. In drafting the legal texts, the Tunisians should take account
of similar experience with vocational training in other sectors.
3.       The sections below give a preliminary checklist (subject
to discussion) of points which should be covered in the legal docu-
ments.
