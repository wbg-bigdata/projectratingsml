MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:         Project Completion Report on Cote d'Ivoire - Industrial
Finance and Development Project (Loan 2617-IVC)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Cote d'Ivoire - Industrial Finance and Development
Project (Loan 2617-IVC) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower has not submitted Part II.
A combination of factors including the growing uncompetitiveness of the Ivorian economy since the
mid-1980s, lack of commitment on the part of the Government, delay of nearly one year before
effectiveness, availability of cheaper funds from other sources, cumbersome approval process (too many
government agencies), and inadequate supervision by the Bank in the earlier years have led to an
unsatisfactory outcome.
A survey of a sample of subprojects in 1992 indicated that three of the fourteen financed through the
project have virtually stopped operation and the remaining are facing serious cash flow problems, especially
because of delays in payment of export subsidies and VAT refunds, and the contraction of the local market.
Moreover, the project did not succeed in devising and organizing a financial intermediation system that
would meet the needs of industry. Proposed measures to restructure the project management and speed up
loan processing were never implemented by the Government. The sustainability of this project is rated as
unlikely, though seven commercial banks became more involved in term lending through access to the
Bank's line of credit.
The project failed to materially strengthen the economic appraisal capability within the Ivorian Banking
system. The two studies undertaken under the project: (i) Competitiveness and Regulatory Framework;
and (ii) Measures to Improve Competitiveness and the Regulatory Framework have, however, served as
the basis for the Government's action plan. The institutional impact of this project is, therefore, rated as
modest.
The PCR is of satisfactory quality. No audit is planned.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(LOAN 2617-IVC)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Industrial Finance and
Development Project (Loan 2617-IVC) to the Government of CMte d'Ivoire, under which a
line of credit for existing industrial enterprises and technical assistance were provided. The
IBRD Loan was approved on September 10, 1985, and became effective on September 2,
1986. A $500,000 reallocation of funds from the line of credit to the technical assistance
component was made in 1990 to provide funds for the financing of the Government's
Competitiveness Sub-Committee. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1993, following a one-
year extension of the Closing Date. By project completion, a total US$18.9 million
equivalent had been disbursed. The last Loan disbursement was processed on August 9,
1993. A total of US$ 11.1 million equivalent was canceled on December 2, 1993.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of the
Occidental and Central Africa Department. The Borrower was requested to submit Part II,
by September 30, 1993. However, it has not as yet been received by the Bank.
The PCR is based on a mission to Cote d'Ivoire, the Staff Appraisal Report, the
President's Report, supervision reports, legal documents and miscellaneous reports and
correspondence in the project files.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(LOAN 2617-IVC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Objective. The principal objectives of the Project were linked to a decision by the
Government of C6te d'Ivoire to address the deterioration of industrial performance and to
adopt, in the framework of SAL II, a comprehensive reform program, including the tariff
system, the Investment Code and domestic taxation. Project objectives consisted primarily of
financing investments and working capital of existing, potentially viable manufacturing
enterprises and providing technical assistance to: (a) ease the adjustment of enterprises to the
reformed policy environment; (b) strengthen the economic appraisal capabilities within the
Ivorian banking system; and (c) strengthen the appraisal capacity of the institutions which
were implementing the Project. It was a pilot effort designed to chart the way for future
Bank lending to Ivorian industry through the banking system as a whole rather than through a
single Development Finance Institution (DFI). Although new industries were not excluded
from IBRD financing, they remained a second priority (Part I, paras. 8 - 11).
2.    In departing from the Bank's traditional approach to lending through a single DFI, the
line of credit was made available under an apex arrangement to all sound banking institutions
in the Ivorian financial system. This approach was the most conducive to securing the widest
participation of the banking network. The national branch of BCEAO in Abidjan, was to act
as the apex institution and administer the line of credit on account of the Government. Given
its extensive role in regulating the financial sector, it was viewed as the most suitable
institution to play this role. However, since the BCEAO is not a national institution, a Loan
Administration Committee, was established, comprised of high level officials from the
Ministries of Industry and Finance, Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) and the
Central Bank. The main function of the Committee, which was chaired by the Ministry of
Industry with the Central Bank acting as the Executive Secretary, was to review and approve
sub-projects, much as the Board of an institution. All commercial banks regulated by the
Central Bank and in compliance with Central Bank creditworthiness criteria were eligible to
utilize the Bank line of credit (Part I, paras. 12 - 14).
3.    Implementatioo. The Project faced serious implementation challenges after Board
approval on September 30, 1985. The date of effectiveness had to be postponed four times
so that Government could fulfill the necessary conditions. With delays mainly stemming from
poor support from the Ministry of Industry, the Project did not become effective until
September 2, 1986. Internal as well as external difficulties plagued the Project up to
completion time. During the two years following effectiveness, apart from financing



- iii -
technical assistance, the Loan, and more specifically the line of credit, remained unutilized.
One of the major contributing factors was the availability of cheaper resources from France,
which Ivorian firms and Ivorian banks could obtain at more favorable rates (9.5 percent, to
be on-lent at 12.5 percent). The IBRD line of credit charged a 13.5 percent interest rate to
sub-borrowers and was thus not attractive either to investors and or to banks. As a result,
the anticipated commitments and disbursements on the IBRD line of credit did not materialize
(Part I, paras. 15 - 17).
4.    There were other reasons why the IBRD line of credit was not utilized as rapidly as
anticipated. First, the apex type lending was a new instrument and the Borrower, did not
have a good understanding of how it worked. Secondly, there were too many Government
agencies involved in sub-project processing. Getting the necessary clearance from all these
agencies created unnecessary delays and costs to sub-borrowers. Thirdly, local project
management was deteriorating and the Borrower's continued non-compliance with the Bank's
audit covenant resulted in the Bank's decision to discontinue all new commitments on the line
of credit. A one-year extension of the closing date was agreed by the Bank to allow the
Borrower to implement measures to restructure the project. These measures included: (a) the
elimination of the Ministry of Industry from the sub-project approval process and the
abolition of the Loan Administration Committee; and (b) the designation of BCEAO as the
only Government agency responsible to: (i) assure that sub-projects met eligibility criteria;
and (ii) transmit investment proposals to the Bank for final approval. However, despite the
extension, a revised audit was never received by the Bank and the project restructuring
measures were never implemented. The Project closed on June 30, 1993, and the
undisbursed balance of $ 11.1 million was canceled on December 2, 1993.(Part I, paras. 18 -
23).
5.    Results. Project results have been mixed. Although the IBRD Loan contributed to
generating an injection of about $ 59.5 million into C6te d'Ivoire's industrial sector and
established the way for future Bank lending through the entire banking system, the final
results were not a total success. The fourteen enterprises financed by the IBRD line of credit
have been confronting constraints faced by most Ivorian enterprises. These constraints
include: (a) contraction of the local market; (b) difficulties in recovering their accounts
receivable, which creates severe cash flow problems; (c) under-capitalization and inadequate
long-term resources; (d) inefficient government support agencies which translated to delays
in payment of the export subsidy and the VAT exemption of exporting enterprises; and (e) a
decline in competitiveness. The situation is critical if one looks at the net cash flow position
of these enterprises. The September 30, 1992 figures show a marked decline from those of
1991, with a total negative net cash flow CFAF 8.5 billion, compared to a negative CFAF
1.9 billion in 1991. Delays in payment of the export subsidy by the Government has had a
significant impact on eight enterprises, which export more than half of their production.
Although in 1992 three of the 14 sub-projects (SIFTEX, QUALIGRAIN and SABRA) had
stopped operations, the persisting difficulties in 1992 combined with the recent devaluation of
the CFAF, have probably led to the closure of more enterprises (Part I, paras. 24 - 27).
6.    As far as the technical assistance component is concerned, although extensive
assistance was given to the Ministry of Industry and BCEAO on project appraisal techniques,
the quality of appraisal reports was consistently inadequate. The survey and retrospective



- iv-
review of sub-projects and analysis of their cash flow position - negative for all enterprises -
clearly demonstrates appraisal weaknesses and unrealistic assumptions, including over-
optimistic sales and market projections and under-estimated working capital requirements
(Part I, para. 24).
7.    Sustainability. Devising and organizing a financial intermediation and technical
assistance project which meets the needs of industry and is managed by the Government is a
complex and difficult task. Given the Government's lack of experience, the undeveloped
institutional framework and a bureaucracy which has its own views on industrial development
and is eager to have control over what industries should or should not be established in the
country, the role designated to Government on this project was not sustainable. As indicated
above, halfway through implementation it was necessary to restructure the local management
to help accelerate sub-project processing time and utilization of loan proceeds (Part I, para.
28).
8.    Conclusions and Lessons Learned. Overall, the performance of industrial enterprises
in CMte d'Ivoire was seriously affected by the state of the Ivorian economy at the time of
project implementation. Between 1986 and 1990, the terms of trade in CMte d'Ivoire declined
by about 40 percent. During that same period, the real effective exchange rate appreciated
by about one third, mainly as a result of the decline in the value of the US dollar and of the
currencies of C6te d'Ivoire's main competitors. Together with excessive and distorted
taxation and an inappropriate and cumbersome regulatory framework, the sharp appreciation
of the real exchange rate has resulted in CMte d'Ivoire's economy becoming largely
uncompetitive. However, although this may have been beyond the immediate control of this
project and of the Borrower, the latter clearly demonstrated a lack of will to address the
implementation problems. The Borrower had the power to comply with the Bank's financial
covenants and thus prevent the cancellation of $ 11.1 million in term lending, greatly needed
by the industrial sector. Yet, it chose not to do so, putting in question the level of
commitment it had on the success of the project and on industrial promotion as a whole (Part
I, para. 30).
9.    The following are some of the lessons learned from this operation which should help
in preparation of future projects:
(a)   Government commitment should be firm and clear of ambiguities;
(b)  the number of parties involved in the processing of appraisal reports should be
minimized to avoid delays. Delays have been costly to enterprises and have
often compromised their confidentiality;
(c)   project appraisal capacity of institutions assisting industrial enterprises should
be strong enough to prevent unrealistic assumptions;
(d)  if commercial banks will be utilizing IBRD financing, given their orientation
towards short-term lending, their capacity to analyze long-term investments and
their economic impact will need to be reinforced;



- v
(e)  the Bank should make sure that the Borrower has adequate capacity to manage
this type of project;
(f)  the level of Bank supervision should be evenly maintained throughout project
implementation in order to respond immediately to rising problems; and
(g)   given the fact that a revised audit on this project has not yet been sent to the
Bank, the Bank should use its leverage, through other Bank operations, to
impress upon the Borrower the importance of compliance with this financial
covenant.

B. BACKGROUND
1.       With a population of 12 million, C6te d'Ivoire is the largest member of the West
Africa Monetary Union (UMOA). Union members, which also include six other countries
(Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo), share a common central bank,
Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO), and a freely convertible
currency, the CFA franc (CFAF). Cote d'Ivoire accounts for 41 percent of the Union's
GDP and 23 percent of its population.
2.       Throughout most of the 1960s and 1970s, the Cote d'Ivoire economy experienced
an extended period of rapid development and balance of payments equilibrium, fueled by
favorable prices for the country's two main export crops, coffee and cocoa. Although
progress was made during this period in diversifying the economy, its overall performance
continued to depend heavily on production and exports of cocoa and coffee. Hence, with the
end of the cocoa boom in 1980-81, the C6te d'Ivoire economy entered a period of deep
economic and financial crisis. Between 1980 and 1984, GDP per capita fell by about 19
percent in real terms. The improvement of the terms of trade in 1985 led to a brief respite.
However, between 1986 and 1990 the terms of trade declined about 40 percent. Over the
same period, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by about one third, mainly as a
result of the decline of the US dollar and of the currencies of C6te D'Ivoire's main
competitors. As a result of excessive and distorted taxation, an inappropriate and
cumbersome regulatory framework, and the sharp appreciation of the real foreign exchange
rate, the economy of CMte d'Ivoire became increasingly uncompetitive.
3.       The Industrial Sector During the 1970s and 1980s. The industrial sector is
dominated by processing agricultural products and seafood, import substitution of consumer
goods and some intermediates. The most important source of industrial exports is seafood
(canned tuna and frozen shrimp) followed by textiles, wood, rubber, processed coffee, palm
oil, chocolate and plastics. Packaging of these projects is generally domestically produced, so



-2-
indirect exports include metal cans, cartons, jute sacks and plastic containers. Cote d'Ivoire's
industry is heavily concentrated in and around Abidjan, accounting for over half of industrial
output and employment. Majority ownership in most firms is private with over one third of
the total equity in industry owned by foreigners, mostly French.
4.       Despite its emphasis on agricultural production, the Ivorian Government has
always given a high priority to industry. It did not invest heavily in the sector but relied
extensively on private initiative (mostly foreign) and on various instruments, including fiscal
and financial incentives and a generous investment code to foster growth in the sector. As a
result of these policies and of the country's political stability, the industrial sector was one of
the most dynamic elements in the Ivorian economy after independence in 1970. Growing at
a 10 percent per annum it accounted for one fifth of GDP in 1980. At the time of appraisal,
manufacturing accounted for 24 percent of total employment in the formal sector and
comprised more than 700 firms, covering a wide spectrum of activities.
5.       However, following a period of rapid growth during the 1970s, the sector
experienced a decline in output and investment and serious marketing and financial
difficulties. Although the world-wide recession and the drastic stabilization programs
undertaken by the Government were the major contributing factors to this decline, tight bank
credit and growing distortions in the incentive system were also at the root of the problem.
Initial industrialization, which was based on the continuous expansion of the domestic market
and on the development of regional markets, took place in the context of a relatively simple
system of incentives, including a generous Investment Code. Increasing wage costs which
followed the rapid growth of the 1960s and the completion of the earlier phase of import
substitution led to demands for somewhat higher protection in the early 1970s, granted
through a reform of the Customs Code in 1973. Distortions in incentives encouraged the
development of inefficient activities, which are basically unable to compete in non-protected
markets and which generate foreign exchange savings at a high cost in terms of domestic
resources. The distorted system also hampered the development of linkages within the sector
and discouraged local production of intermediate goods. Finally, institutional support to
industry was largely ineffective, due in part to poor management and lack of coordination
among the various public entities.
6.       The Policy Reform Program. In response to the deterioration of industrial
performance and in order to improve competitiveness and promote intra-sectoral linkages,
the Government decided to adopt in the framework of SAL II, a comprehensive reform
program, including comprehensive revisions of the tariff system, the Investment Code and
domestic taxation. Furthermore, the Government established a separate Ministry of Industry
to act as the focal point for all policies affecting the sector as well as an Industrial Project
Unit to appraise the economic soundness of all new large industrial investments, as well as
those applying for investment code benefits. The bulk of the reforms became effective in
1985.
7.       A review of four major sub-sectors (textiles, wood, agro-processing and electro-
mechanical industries) carried out by the Bank before the Industrial Finance and
Development Project was launched indicated that this policy-induced restructuring would
require significant investment, which could not be financed given the lack of domestically



-3-
available resources. Most firms relied on short-term debt in the banking system and many
would not survive unless they could secure financing for their restructuring. Similarly, bank
credits became increasingly difficult due to scarcity of resources, including a tightening of
the Central Bank rediscounting. The Industrial Finance and Development Project originated
from the Bank's extensive sector work in Cote d'Ivoire and was a logical complement to the
program of industrial reforms that were being implemented by the Government under SAL
H.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Projiect Objectives
8.       The principal objectives of the Project were linked to the above mentioned SAL II
reforms and consisted primarily of providing financial and technical support to existing,
potentially viable enterprises to ease their adjustment to the reformed policy environment. It
was a pilot effort designed to chart the way for future Bank lending to industries in Cote
d'Ivoire through the banking system as a whole rather than through a single Development
Finance Institution (DFI). Although new industries were not excluded from IBRD financing,
they remained a second priority.
9.       Project objectives also included the development of manufactured exports, growth
in term lending to industry and strengthening the economic appraisal capabilities within the
Ivorian banking system.
Project Description
10.      In line with these objectives, the Loan of US$ 30.00 million consisted of a line of
credit to finance the investment and permanent working capital requirements of economically
viable existing manufacturing enterprises as well as for new projects ($28.5 million); and
technical assistance to build up the institutions which were implementing the project ($1.5
million).
11.      A special unit, the Industrial Advisory Services Unit (IASU), was to be set up in
the Ministry of Industry to advise industrialists and assist them in: (a) evaluating the impact
of the reforms on their respective firm; (b) carrying out a preliminary diagnosis of the firm's
weaknesses and strengths; (c) identifying broad areas of efficiency improvement; (d)
reviewing the need for physical and financial restructuring; and (e) making a preliminary
proposal on the type and extent of restructuring required by the firms to improve
performance. The IASU would also assist industrialists, when necessary, in preparing their
applications to the banks for financing. It was to be staffed by two experienced experts and
two or three counterparts. The total cost of six man-years of the two resident experts and one
man-year of short-term consultant services was to be financed by the technical assistance
component of Bank Loan ($0.8 million). The technical assistance component would also
finance: (a) broad product identification, marketing and/or other industrial sector related
studies to help develop exports ($0.25 million); (b) advisory services to assist the Central
Bank in administering the line of credit ($0.2 million); and (c) consultant services to train the



-4-
staff of the Central Bank and participating banks in economic analysis of sub-projects ($0.1
million).
12.      Line of Credit. In departing from the Bank's traditional approach to lending
through a single DFI, the line of credit was made available under an apex arrangement to all
sound banking institutions in the Ivorian financial system. This approach was the most
conducive to securing the widest participation of the banking network. The national branch of
BCEAO in Abidjan, was to act as the apex institution and administer the line of credit on
account of the Government. Given its extensive role in regulating the financial sector, it was
viewed as the most suitable institution to play this role. However, since the BCEAO is not a
national institution, a Loan Administration Committee, was established, comprised of high
level officials from the Ministries of Industry and Finance, Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA) and the Central Bank. The main function of the Committee, which
was chaired by the Ministry of Industry with the Central Bank acting as the Executive
Secretary, was to review and approve sub-projects, much as the Board of an institution. All
commercial banks regulated by the Central Bank and in compliance with Central Bank
creditworthiness criteria were eligible to utilize the Bank line of credit.
13.      Eligible enterprises included those which: (a) had their principal activity in the
textile, wood, agro-processing and electro-mechanical sectors; (b) met the Central Bank's
creditworthiness requirements; and (c) had submitted technically, financially and
economically sound restructuring proposals, demonstrating that they could generate an
economic rate of return of no less than 10 percent on overall investments.
14.      Funds on-lent under the line of credit to participating banks were in local
currency, with maturities based on a flexible schedule corresponding to the amortization
schedules of sub-loans. Sub-loans to beneficiaries would range from a minimum of two to a
maximum of 15 years, inclusive of grace period from one to three years. Under Subsidiary
Loan Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, Bank funds would be on-lent to participating
banks at a floating rate equal to the Bank rate plus a commitment fee of 0.75 percent and a
2.0 percent commission, to be passed to the final borrowers. The 2.0 percent commission
would accrue to the Government for its assumption of the foreign exchange risk.
Participating banks would retain a fixed spread of 3.0 percent, thus bringing the final cost to
sub-borrowers equal to the IBRD rate plus 5.0 percent per annum. Passing on the foreign
exchange risk to the final borrowers, which is the Bank's normal practice, was not feasible
under this Project because of prevailing Central Bank regulations which do not allow banking
institutions in the West African Monetary Union (UMOA) to make foreign currency
denominated loans.
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
15.      The Project faced serious implementation challenges after Board approval on
September 30, 1985. The date of effectiveness of the Project had to be postponed four times
so that Government could fulfill the conditions of effectiveness, which included: (a) the
implementation of the SAL II reforms for the industrial sector, in accordance with an agreed
schedule; (b) the establishment of a Loan Administration Committee; (c) the signing of a



-5- 
protocol between the Govemment and the Central Bank, as well as agreement of cooperation
and respective roles of the various ministries involved (Ministry of Industry, Ministry of
Finance, CAA and BCEAO), under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank; (d) the
distribution by the Govemment, through the Central Bank, of a detailed circular outlining the
terms and conditions for the use of the line of credit by the banking system; and (e) the
distribution by the Govemment to the banking system of a project evaluation manual. With
delays mainly stemming from poor support from the Ministry of Industry, the Project did not
become effective until September 2, 1986.
16.      Internal as well as external difficulties plagued the Project up to completion time.
During the two years following effectiveness, apart from financing technical assistance, the
Loan, and more specifically the line of credit, remained unutilized. One of the major factors
that contributed to the lack of interest in the Bank line of credit was the availability of
cheaper resources from France which Ivorian firms and Ivorian banks could obtain at more
favorable rates (9.5 percent, to be on-lent at 12.5 percent). Given these resources, the IBRD
line of credit, which charged a 13.5 percent interest rate to sub-borrowers, was no longer
attractive either to investors or to banks. As a result, the anticipated commitments and
disbursements on the EBRD line of credit did not materialize.
17.      In order to restore the competitiveness of the line of credit and at the
recommendation of the Bank, the Government agreed in early 1987, to reduce its foreign
exchange risk commission from 2.0 percent to 1.0 percent, and thus lower the final interest
rate to sub-borrowers from 13.5 percent to 12.5 percent. Although this modification made
the IBRD line of credit more competitive, it did not immediately result in the response
expected. Only two sub-projects were approved in late 1987, and three in 1988. The bulk of
commitments for sub-projects were not made until 1989 and 1990.
18.      There were, however, other reasons why the IBRD line of credit was not utilized
as rapidly as anticipated. First, the apex type lending was a new instrument and the Ivorian
Government, did not have a good understanding of how it worked. Secondly, there were too
many Government agencies involved in sub-project processing ( the IASU, the Loan
Administration Committee, BCEAO, and CAA). Getting clearance from all the groups
involved created unnecessary costly delays for enterprises not only in processing investment
proposals but also in processing disbursement requests.
19.      Finally, sub-project appraisal reports, which should have been prepared by the
financial intermediaries, were prepared by the IASU in the Ministry of Industry. Despite the
substantial technical assistance available to IASU, these appraisals were often inadequate,
required additional work and resulted in more delays. Often, appraisal reports named
financial intermediaries while a financial intermediary had, in fact, not been identified. There
was one case where the bank named as financial intermediary in the appraisal report had, in
fact, rejected that project. Twelve sub-projects which had been approved by the Bank had to
be cancelled following the confirmation of a supervision mission that no financial
intermediary had been identified.
20.      Furthermore, Bank procedures were not always followed in the procurement of
consultant services. In several cases, consultants were hired and financed through the Special



-6-
Account without appropriate contracts and without prior Bank approval.
21.      Nevertheless, the Bank continued its efforts to address the lingering project
management difficulties to help accelerate commitments on the uncommitted balance of the
line of credit. In 1991, the Bank sought the agreement of the Ivorian Government on a
proposal to restructure local project management to streamline the sub-project review and
approval process and reduce delays. The proposal included: (a) the elimination of the
Ministry of Industry from the sub-project approval process and the abolition of the Loan
Administration Committee; (b) the designation of BCEAO as the only Government agency
responsible to: (i) assure that sub-projects met eligibility criteria; and (ii) transmit investment
proposals to the Bank for final approval. However, as the Borrower had never complied
with the financial covenants of the Loan, all new commitments on the Bank line of credit
were discontinued until a satisfactory audit had been prepared and sent to the Bank.
22.      Although the Government gave its agreement to the restructuring proposal in mid-
1991, by mid-1992, it had neither put in place the necessary measures nor sent to the Bank
an audit of project accounts. In June 1992, in order to prevent the cancellation of the
undisbursed balance on the line of credit, the Government launched the audit and renewed its
commitment to implement the restructuring measures, and asked the Bank for an extension of
the closing date. Since an audit had been started and since supervision missions had already
confirmed with Ivorian commercial banks that their existing project pipeline could utilize,
within six months, the remaining balance of the line of credit, the Bank agreed to a one-year
extension of the Closing Date, to June 30, 1993. While agreeing to an extension, however,
the Bank maintained its position that there would be no new commitments on the line of
credit until a satisfactory audit had been received.
23.      A draft audit report was finally sent to the Bank in January 1993 but it was
incomplete and unsatisfactory. Because of the absence of a proper accounting system by the
Borrower and relevant documentation, the auditor was unable to verify important
expenditures. Furthermore, the audit did not include information either on the investment
projects or the Special Account, as was required in the Loan Agreement. In February 1993
the Bank informed the Borrower and requested that the audit report be revised to include the
missing information. However, the Bank's requests continued to be ignored by the
Borrower. The key measures to improve project implementation were never put in place and
a revised satisfactory audit has never been sent to the Bank. Although the Government was
reluctant to see the balance of the loan cancelled, it displayed a lack of will to follow through
with the revision of the audit. The net result is that the project closed on June 30, 1993 and
the uncommitted balance of about $11.1 million was canceled on December 2, 1993.
E. PROJECT RESULTS
24.      Project results have been mixed. Although the IBRD Loan contributed to
generating an injection of about $ 59.5 million into CMte d'Ivoire's industrial sector and
established the way for future Bank lending through the entire banking system, the final
results were not a total success. Three of the fourteen sub-projects financed by the IBRD
Loan have virtually stopped operations and the remaining 11 had, as of September 30, 1992,



-7-
severe liquidity problems. As far as the technical assistance component is concerned,
although extensive assistance was given to the Ministry of Industry and BCEAO on project
appraisal techniques, the quality of appraisal reports was consistently inadequate. A survey
and retrospective review of sub-projects clearly demonstrated appraisal weaknesses, which
included over-optimistic sales projections and under-estimated working capital requirements,
as demonstrated by the negative cash flow position of all the enterprises (Table 6, page 22).
Furthermore, given the evolution of the Project and the need to restructure its management,
it is unclear how project appraisal capacity will be used by the Ministry and BCEAO in the
future. The training provided to commercial bank staff was not adequate and given banks'
short-term credit orientation, they continue to lack the expertise necessary to evaluate the
long-term economic risks of investment projects. One positive outcome is that seven
commercial banks became more involved in term lending through access to the Bank line of
credit and some were interested in receiving more IBRD resources.
Line of Credit
25.      The EBRD line of credit, equivalent of US $ 17.6 million, financed 14 enterprises
in the agro-industrial, chemical, packaging, wood and textile sectors. About 43 percent of
the total amount financed agro-industrial projects and 25 percent packaging. The line of
credit helped create two new industries and restructure 12 existing enterprises, of which 79
percent are located in urban areas. It should be noted that these enterprises were conceived
during 1987 and 1988 when the recession that hit the economy of Cote d'Ivoire had a
significant impact on the performance and level of activity of most enterprises in the country.
Twelve of the enterprises generated 790 permanent jobs at investment costs per job ranging
between $ 20,000 to over $270,000. However, persistent financial difficulties faced by
enterprises forced the reduction in the labor force thus reducing the number of jobs created
to 621. (Table 6 pages 16 and 17).
26.      Sub-project performance. A survey was carried out on a sample of 11 sub-projects
financed under the line of credit. Key indicators on the characteristics and performance of
these enterprises are given in pages 16 through 22 (Tables 1 through 6). On the basis of
information available, although employment generation exceeded projected levels by a
margin of about 38 percent, a large number of the firms failed to realize their estimated
volume of sales, partly due to optimistic projections in the appraisal reports and partly to
marketing problems. Actual net profits were less than one third of the projected levels.
Although most enterprises did not achieve their projected profitability, the IBRD/commercial
bank resources enabled them to recover and to generate additional value added for at least a
short period.
27.      The difficulties confronted by the fourteen enterprises are constraints faced by
most Ivorian enterprises. These constraints include: (a) contraction of the local mnarket; (b)
difficulties in recovering their accounts receivable, which creates severe cash flow problems;
(c) under-capitalization and inadequate long-term resources; (d) inefficient government
support agencies which translated to delays in payment of the export subsidy and the VAT
exemption of exporting enterprises; and (e) a decline in competitiveness. The situation is
critical if one looks at the net cash flow position of these enterprises. The September 30,
1992 figures show a marked decline from those of 1991, with a total negative net cash flow



-8-
CFAF 8.5 billion, compared to a negative CFAF 1.9 billion in 1991. Delays in payment of
the export subsidy by the Government has had a significant impact on eight enterprises,
which export more than half of their production. Although three of the 14 sub-projects
(SIFTEX, QUALIGRAIN and SABRA) had stopped operations, the persisting difficulties,
combined with the recent devaluation of the CFAF, have probably led to the closure of more
enterprises.
F. PROJrECT SUSTAINABILITY
28.      Devising and organizing a financial intermediation and technical assistance project
which meets the needs of industry and is managed by the Government is a complex and
difficult task. Given the Government's lack of experience, the undeveloped institutional
framework and a bureaucracy which has its own views on industrial development and is
eager to have control over what industries should or should not be established in the country,
the role that the project designated to Government was not sustainable. As indicated above,
halfway through project implementation it was necessary to restructure the local management
to help accelerate sub-project processing time. Given the Borrower's non-compliance with
the Bank's audit requirement, it was not possible to test whether the Project would have been
better managed by BCEAO. What is clear is that the six commercial banks utilized loan
proceeds to provide term financing to industries and would have utilized the entire balance
had commitments not been discontinued. In that respect, the project objective of generating
greater involvement of commercial banks in Bank lending to industries has been achieved.
G. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
29.      Given the fact that the apex type instrument was new to the Ivorian Government,
the Project should have been supervised more rigorously and much more frequently by the
Bank, particularly during 1987 and 1988, the first two years of project implementation.
Unfortunately, this period coincided with the Bank's 1987 institutional reorganization, which
required that some projects be managed by other technical divisions outside the Departments
concerned. More intensive supervision could have identified the problems earlier and
possibly prevented the suspension of commitments on the line of credit, from which the
project was never able to recover. Based on available records, while there was an average of
at least two Bank supervision missions before 1987, there was only one supervision mission
in 1987, one in 1988 and none in 1989.
H. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
30.      The Borrower's overall performance during project implementation was not
satisfactory. Although the Borrower occasionally demonstrated its commitment to the
objectives of the Project, for example reducing its foreign exchange risk commission to help
accelerate the utilization of the IBRD line of credit, its performance, overall was far from
supportive. It took the Government almost a year to fulfill the conditions of effectiveness and
on a number of occasions failed to comply with the Bank's procurement procedures in hiring
and financing consultants. Furthermore, later during project implementation, the Borrower



-9-
repeatedly ignored the Bank's requests to restructure local project management and to satisfy
the Bank's audit requirement. By not complying with the Bank's financial covenants, it
deprived the private sector from greatly needed term financing. Despite repeated requests,
the Bank has still not received a revised, satisfactory audit of project accounts. The net
result was that the uncommitted balance of the line of credit, equivalent to US $ 11.1 million
was canceled. This was unfortunate because there were indications from major commercial
banks that projects in their pipeline could have utilized the balance of the IBRD line of credit
in six months.
I. CONSULTING SERVICES
31.      The Project financed the IASU expatriate consultants as well as technical
assistance to BCEAO and training in project appraisal techniques to staff of commercial
banks. Although their competence was considered satisfactory at the time, given the quality
of appraisal reports, their contribution to building the capacity of the IASU is questionable.
32.      The Project also financed consulting services and operating costs of the
Competitiveness Sub-Committee, created in 1990 by the Government at the recommendation
of the Bank, to prepare a program of measures to improve the competitiveness and reform
the regulatory framework in CMte d'Ivoire. The Sub-Committee consisted of three local
consultants, two professionals and a secretary. Overall, their performance was outstanding
and set the scene for the regulatory adjustment operation (PASCO), Loan 3429-IVC.
