SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on India
Combined Cycle Power Project (Loan 2674-IN)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the India: Combined Cycle Power Project (Loan
2674-IN, approved in FY86) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office; Part II was drafted by the sub-borrower
and implementing entity, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).
The loan for US$485 million equivalent was closed on December 31, 1993, two years after the original
date and was fully disbursed. It supported the eleventh operation to assist the power sector in India. The project's
main objective was to provide additional least-cost thermal capacity in Northern and Western India to help
eliminate power shortages. To relieve pressures on the coal sectors and coal transport by railway, the project
helped introduce combined cycle power generation technology in India (the technology relies on the use of the
large volumes of excess gas which were previously flared). The physical project consisted of the installation of
three combined cycle power plants in three states (Gajarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) totaling 1,500 MW and
1,325 kms of high voltage transmission lines.
The project was delayed because of the lengthy procurement process and technical problems with the
equipment. Yet, only one of the three plants had a delayed commissioning and a modest transfer of know how in
combined cycle technology took place. The three plants are operational and the tariff formula allows recovery of
capital and operating costs plus a profit. Sector policy reforms have strengthened NTPC's finances, including the
collection of bills. Uncertainties as to the availability of gas have not been removed but the unit can be fired with
liquid fuels. The economic analysis was based on the time-slices of NTPC's investments in the Northern and
Western Regions, respectively. The economic rates of return are much better than estimated at appraisal (14-16
percent vs. 3-7 percent).
The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) rates the outcome of the project as satisfactory (vs.
highly satisfactory in the PCR); its sustainability as likely as in the PCR; and its impact on institutional
development as moderate (vs. substantial): the improvement in accounts receivable collection was
obtained more as a condition for further lending than as a product of this project's supervision but the
transfer of technology on combined cycle technology maintenance was successful. Borrower and Bank
performances are rated as satisfactory (as in the PCR). The PCR provides adequate information about
project implementation and results.
No audit is planned as a major review of loans to NTPC was done recently by OED.

PROJECT COMhPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the gas-based Combined Cycle Power Project
in India, for which Loan 2674-IN in the amount of US$ 485 million equivalent was signed on 27
October 1986, and made effective 27 March 1987. The loan closed on 31 December 1993 as
compared with the original loan closing date of 31 December 1991. The loan amount was fully
disbursed by 2 June 1994. Cofinancing was provided by the International Bank of Japan, and French
and Belgian export credits. The balance amount was met by the National Thermal Power Corporation
(NTPC) from its own internal resources.
The loan, made to India, acting by its President, was onlent to NTPC for implementation. The
physical components of the project comprised the instaUlation of three combined cycle power plants in
the Northern and Western Regions of India, along with their associated transmission components. The
main objective of the project was to provide power in these regions, then suffering from acute power
shortages, through the use of combined cycle power plants which entailed reduced environmental
impacts and much smaller gestation periods, as well as higher efficiency of energy conversion,
compared to conventional coal-fired power generation technology. These objectives were met, albeit
with delays in project implementation, some of which was beyond the control of NTPC. There were
delays in the investment approval of the project by the Government of India (GOI) resulting in an
extension of the implementation schedule envisaged in the SAR. In the case of the Kawas plant,
difficulties in concluding a contract with the winning bidder led to the need for a rebidding, which
further delayed project implementation. Serious teething problems were experienced in all three plants
during the commissioning phase. Project implementation during the construction phase, however, was
satisfactory as most of the generating units were synchronized and placed in service ahead of the
revised schedules, established at the time of contract award for the respective power plants.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was prepared by the Energy and
Infrastructure Operations Division, South Asia Country Department II, with input from NTPC. Part II
(Project Review from the Borrower's Perspective) was prepared by GOI and NTPC (In case the said
Part II is not received, the last sentence will be deleted).
Preparation of this PCR started during the Bank's final supervision mission of the project in
October 1993, and a follow-up mission in November 1994, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 5831-IN), the Loan and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondences between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and the Project
Completion Report prepared by NTPC for its own internal evaluation and archives.

COMBINED CYCLE POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2674-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
i.    At the time the project was initiated, consumption of electricity in India had grown at an
average annual rate of 8 percent during the past two decades. Although a number of coal-fired thermal
projects was planned for the short-term, the deteriorating quality of coal caused increase in station use
and adverse environmental impacts on the one hand, and frequent equipment breakdowns and forced
outages on the other, resulting in severe power shortages throughout India. Additionally, the increase
in the number of coal-fired power stations imposed burdens on both the coal sector and the railways.
The development of the large South Bassein and satellite gas fields in the west coast of India, together
with the associated gas available from the Bombay High field, provided considerable economic
opportunity to extend the use of gas for power generation in areas that were remote from the coal
fields.
Objectives
ii.    The main objectives of the project were to provide power in the Northern and Westem
Regions of India that were suffering from acute power shortages; diversify the fuels used in power
generation, through the use of gas or liquid fuels in regions which were short of hydro and coal
resources; relieve pressure on the railway and coal sectors; and introduce in India the combined cycle
power generation technology that would provide an efficient, clean, flexible and economic source of
power. The project has fully achieved its objectives albeit with some delays through successful
completion and commissioning of the three gas-based Combined Cycle Power Plants, built in Anta,
Auraiya and Kawas.
Implementation Experience
iii.    NTPC successfully implemented the project, although initial delays in the investment approval
of the project by the GOI necessitated a revision of the original commissioning schedule envisaged in
the SAR. Project implementation based on the revised schedules for each power plant was by and
large satisfactory: most of the generating units were synchronized ahead of schedule. It is curious to
note that serious equipment problems, basically of identical nature, were experienced in all three power
plants even though the equipment were supplied by entirely different manufacturers, each of
international repute. This is discussed in greater detail in Part I, para. 35. The problems were
satisfactorily resolved and the plants were finally put in commercial operation, thereby helping mitigate
to a large extent, the acute power shortages in the respective regions. Considering that the project
represented the first combined cycle power project in India, NTPC's performance in construction
management and subsequent operation of the plants in a commercial mode is rated satisfactory.
However, NTPC's management of procurement of the Kawas Power Plant was not impressing and
caused additional implementation delays.



- ii -
Results
iv.    The project included power plants at Anta and Auraiya in the northern part of India, and
Kawas in the western part of the country, as well as associated 220/400 kV transmission lines. The
installed capacity of the northem region increased by 8.3% with the commissioning of 1,065 MW of
additional capacity provided by Anta and Auraiya, while that of the western region increased by 4.5%
with an additional 644 MW provided by Kawas. Coal-fired power plants typically operate at 36-37%
overall thermal efficiency, while the combined cycle technology offers a significantly higher energy
conversion efficiency of 45% or higher. Thus, the addition of a total of 1,709 MW of combined cycle
generation signified a substantial increase in the overall efficiency of the system. However, non-
availability of gas at the Kawas plant has accounted for forced outage of the entire power station on
numerous occasions in the recent past. NTPC has already initiated steps to install alternate fuel firing
capability at this plant, the construction of which has started.
Sustainability
v.    The project is clearly sustainable on financial grounds. Power remains in short supply
throughout India and specifically the demand for the fill output of the three power plants exists.
The demand growth for electricity is increasing at the rate of about 8% per annum in the northern and
western regions. The present tariff setting procedures for generation from NTPC stations allow
recovery of capital and operating costs and provide a reasonable profit margin for capital
improvements. The new two-part tariff (to cover fixed and variable costs), introduced with effect
from I November 1992, provides for incentives to operate the plants efficiently and with high
availability. Even though billing and collection have been persistent problems for NTPC for a long
time, the recent policy reforms implemented by GOI have changed the commercial operations of
NTPC and increased its financial strength to put NTPC in a position to raise funds in both the domestic
and international markets (Part I, para. 18). However, GOI and NTPC will need to address some
specific policy matters, as detailed in Part I, para. 38, so that the superiority of combined cycle plants
over conventional plants is established.
Summary of Project Cost and Financing Arrangements
vi.    The actual project cost was Rs. 26,567 million (US$ 1,229.7 million equivalent), including the
associated transmission components and interest during construction. In terms of Rupees, the project
cost increased by almost 65% because of the devaluation of the Rupee with respect to the US dollar,
while in terms of the US$ the project cost was slightly lower (Part I, para. 42).
vii.   The Bank loan of US$ 485 million equivalent provided about 40 percent of the total project
cost. Financing was also provided by the International Bank of Japan, French and Belgian export
credits. The balance of the project cost was met from NTPC's own intemal resources.



- iii -
Implementation Time Table
viui.   Project implementation suffered due to: (a) delays in meeting the conditions of loan
effectiveness; (b) delay in investment approval for the project by GOI; (c) delays in procurement; in
particular, that of the Kawas Power Plant; and (d) serious equipment problems during the
commissioning phase of all three plants. The loan closing date had to be extended twice to pernit
completion of the project, as well as disbursements under the loan.
Summary of Performance of the Borrower and of the Bank
ix.    The performance of NTPC was satisfactory in respect of compliance with the loan covenants,
except for the one requiring NTPC's accounts receivable to be reduced to a level not exceeding an
arnount equivalent to the preceding two months of billing. Bill collection has been a persistent problem
with NTPC because of the poor financial situation of many SEBs and the lack of an appropriate
contractual framework. At the end of FY90, NTPC's level of accounts receivable was equivalent to
seven months of sales. In mid- 1990, the Bank decided to cancel the processing of a new loan of
US$375 million to NTPC, which was negotiated. From mid-1990 to mid- 1993, GOI introduced a
number of policy reforms in the power sector which enabled NTPC to take remedial measures to
efficiently manage its commercial operations. As a result, better collection from the SEBs and
payments by GOI through Central Appropriations (CA) on behalf of the SEBs helped NTPC gradually
reduce its accounts receivable. As part of the conditionality under the NTPC Power Generation
Project (Ln. 3632-IN; FY93), the Bank agreed that for the purpose of monitoring compliance
with the two months accounts receivable covenant, the amounts still due from CA were to be
excluded. As of March 31, 1993 (end of FY93), NTPC was in compliance with the accounts
receivable covenant thus modified. Based on this data, Ln. 3632-IN was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors in June 1993. However, during the first three months of FY94,
NTPC bill collection performance dropped again to about 72% and there was little evidence
that NTPC was applying the newly adopted commercial policies by regulating power to
defaulting SEBs. At the end of various communications between the Bank, GOI and NTPC,
in February 1994, the Bank agreed with GOI and NTPC, that GOI and NTPC would refrain
from submitting disbursements applications under Ln.2844-IN (National Capital Power
project) and under the generation component of Ln.2845-IN (Talcher Thermal Project) until
NTPC was in compliance with the agreed receivable covenant. Ln.2674-IN was excluded
because the loan was closed on December 31, 1993. In addition to the informal suspension of
disbursements, Ln. 3632-IN was not declared effective. Following further remedial actions by
GOI and NTPC, the latter was, as of May 31, 1994, able to comply with the covenant, as
amended. GOI began once again submitting disbursements applications and the Bank declared
Ln. 3632-IN effective. NTPC's accounts receivable performance is being monitored on a
monthly basis (Part I, paras. 13-16).
x.    The Bank remained intimately involved, from the preparation of the project through project
completion. It maintained good relations with GOI and NTPC throughout the execution of the



-iv -
project, in spite of occasional tensions during the procurement of the Kawas Power Plant and during
the period remedies to NTPC's accounts receivable problem were brought by GOI and NTPC. In
addition to helping to the liquidation of accumulated arrears of SEBs, the Bank was instrumental in
helping NTPC correct a number of shortcomings of broader sectoral concerns in their operations, such
as, the introduction of a more comprehensive approach towards environmental protection and
resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) issues and the establishment of a training institute to develop
human resources. However, the Bank should have addressed the unsatisfactory accounts receivable
position and NTPC's failure to meet the associated loan covenants much earlier on and acted more
firmly. The Bank let this default go on far too long before beginnring to consider using its remedies,
and thus had a more difficult time dealing with the problem which would have been easier if tackled
earlier.
Project Outcome
xi.    Overall, the project has been successful in meeting its principal objectives. The
physical targets of the generation components were achieved. The project assisted in the
transfer of know-how through the construction of the first ever combined cycle power plants in
India and the improvement of financial discipline in NTPC's operations that has increased its
credibility and potential to borrow from conmmercial sources.
Findings and Lessons Learned
xii.   Major findings are as follows:
(a)    The project was instrumental in introducing in India the combined cycle technology for
the first time based on a feasibility report prepared in 1985 (Part I, para.4);
(b)    The three combined cycle power plants, using natural gas as fuel, has been able to
releive the pressure on the coal sector, as well as on the railways, correspondingly.
Had this been equivalent coal-fired generation, the project would have required at least
5 nillion tons of coal per year to be moved in more than 71,000 box wagons requiring
at least 1,000 trips from the mines to the plant sites (Part L para. 19);
(c)    Single tum-key contracts for the main plant and equipment, especially for this new
technology, proved to be easier to implement and manage (Part I, para. 30);
(d)   The procurement cycle, starting from issuing of bid invitation to contract award, could
be significantly shortened. Delays in the procurement cycle caused slippage of the
project implementation schedule as compared to the schedule set at appraisal. NTPC
should make its own procurement decisions independent of any external involvement in
the process (Part I, para. 32);



v 
(e)    Procurement should be completed during the bid validity period to avoid
complications. In the event bid validity is extended, the bidders' right to adjust
implementation schedule accordingly should also be recognized (Part I, para. 33);
(f)    Technical specifications for equipment should be based on proven technology and
proven perforrnance record only (Part I, para 35);
(g)    Departure from the original design concept that would have assured dual-fuel firing
capability should not have been made based on the verbal assurance of other
govermment agencies. Written contracts should be required between the concerned
parties, even though they may be government concems, to bind them legally to an
agreement (Part 1, para. 36);
(h)    The project performance indicates the need for establishing economic prices for the
fuels used in power generation in India, particularly for natural gas, so that the power
stations may be operated based on comparative efficiencies and economic costs of
generation (Part I, para.3 8);
(i)    The R&R issues had to be revisited again based on Bank guidelines that require the
Project Affected Persons (PAP) to be compensated for their losses such that their
former living standards and income capacity were at least restored. R&R aspects of a
project need to be addressed as a part of the Environmental Impact Assessment and
detailed during project preparation (Part I, para. 41),
'j)    Violation of loan covenants, especially those dealing with the financial health of the
beneficiary, should be addressed immediately as they occur and with firm, action-
oriented plans for ensuring early compliance (Part I, para 53); and,
(k)    The project helped improve NTPC's financial position with the improvement of
financial discipline in their operations (Part I, para. 54).

Subsector                         Power
Background
1.    In India, responsibility for electricity supply is shared constitutionally between the Government
of India (GOD) and the States. The State Electricity Boards (SEB) and the Regional Electricity Boards
are controlled by the States; the Department of Power within the Ministry of Energy of the GOI
administers the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the National Thermal Power Corporation
(NTPC), the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), the Rural Electrification
Corporation (REC), and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). The SEBs, NTPC and NHPC are
charged with the responsibility of promoting the development of the power subsector under the
Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948.
2.    The performance of SEBs was vitiated by poor quality and persistent unreliability of power
systems. Chronic power shortages in the 1970s and the adverse effect these were having on the
productive sectors of the economy prompted the GOI to intensify its efforts to balance the demand and
supply of electricity. The strategy developed for this purpose was to supplement the efforts of SEBs
by installing large power plants, along with associated high voltage transmission lines, in different parts
of India where power shortages were acute. The emphasis was on: (a) accelerating the development of
hydropower potential and large coal-fired power plants at pit-head locations and in the proximity of
load centers; (b) improving the efficiency of the thermal power plants and reducing losses in the
transmission and distribution networks; (c) expanding the rural electrification program; and (d)
strengthening the organization and management capabilities of the SEBs.
3.    Performance of the coal-fired power plants, however, became extremely unreliable because of
deteriorating quality of the coal which caused frequent equipment breakdowns. Furthernore, the
increase in the number of coal-fired power stations imposed severe burdens on the coal industry and
the railways. The finding of natural gas in large quantities in the western off-shore region in the late



1970s, had prompted GOI to adopt the policy of utilizing the gas entirely for the premium markets
comprising fertilizer and petrochemical industries. But because of delays in the construction of these
industries and the supporting infrastructure, large volumes of excess gas were being flared. This
economic opportunity prompted GOI to decide in favor of utilizing some of the gas for power
generation. Gas-based power generation is environmentally clean, offers higher efficiency when
operated in the combined cycle mode, as well as a much shorter gestation period. As an added
advantage, it is possible to operate the plant with the gas turbines alone in an open cycle mode as soon
as they could be installed, while the back end of the plant comprising the waste heat recovery boiler
and the conventional steam turbine and generator plant was still under construction.
4.    A feasibility report in support of the Combined Cycle Power Project was prepared by NTPC in
1985. This report concluded that three power plants could be built at Anta in Rajasthan, Auraiya in
Uttar Pradesh and Kawas in Gujarat, totaling a combined generating capacity of about 1,500 MW.
These areas were far away from coal mines, and also near the 1,700 km HBJ gas pipeline from Hazira
to Jagadishpur, traversing the States of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, with a spur into
Rajasthan. Appraisal of the project by the Bank in September 1985 confirmed these conclusions.
Project negotiations were held with the Bank in Washington in February 1986 and the loan of US$
485.0 equivalent was approved by the Board in April 1986.
The Implementing Agency (NTPC) at the Time of Project Appraisal
5.    GOI was the Borrower of the loan; NTPC was the implementing agency with the Borrower's
assistance, under a subsidiary loan agreement. NTPC was formed in 1975 to construct and operate
large power stations and associated transmission facilities. It sells bulk power to the SEBs for
distribution. At appraisal, NTPC was in the tenth year of an investment program under which it
planned to construct and commission by 1999/2000 several large power plants with an aggregate
capacity of about 26,000 MW and about 24,000 km of high voltage transnission lines. By the end of
1984/85, NTPC's installed capacity was 2,200 MW. Its very first 200 MW generating unit at
Singrauli began commercial operation in 1982. Since then, ten additional 200 MW units were
conmmissioned; four at Singrauli, three at Korba, and three at Rarnagundam.
6.    NTPC's net earnings in 1983/84 exceeded forecasts and yielded a rate of return (ROR) of
about 11 percent based on historically valued assets. The equivalent ROR on revalued assets,
calculated on a proforma basis, was slightly more than 5 percent. Cash generation measured as a
percentage of average annual capital investment requirements was, however, only about 3 percent,
primarily because of the scale of existing operations and a very large investment program. NTPC's
debt-equity ratio at the end of 1983/84 was 26:74; however, it already had serious bill collection
problems at the time. By and large, its overall financial performance in 1983/84 and its financial
position at year end were satisfactory.

NTPC at the Time of Project Completion
7.    By end 1993, NTPC operated about 18 percent of India's total installed generating capacity
and 26 percent of the thermal capacity. Its share in India's total power supplies reached about 22
percent of total generation. NTPC has demonstrated that Government owned power utilities can also
be operated at acceptable efficiency levels. It is managed by a corporate culture based on professional
pride of successful accomplishments through a highly motivated staff.
8.    As a part of the Bank's ongoing dialogue with GOI and NTPC, the Government has
introduced a nurnber of policy reforms aimed at increasing commercialization and efficiency of
NTPC's operations, as well as fostering private sector participation in the generation of power.
These reforrms include: (a) improvement of generating efficiency; (b) transfer of NTPC's
transmission systems and corresponding liabilities, including associated personnel, to the
POWERGRID, created in 1989; (c) introduction of commercial and investment policies that permit
NTPC to cut off power to consumers, whenever physically and technically feasible, for non-
compliance with agreed terins of bulk power supply agreements, while delaying investments in
non-complying states; (d) undertaking projects in one region with a substantial part of the output
allocated to other regions; (e) entering into undertakings with foreign and local private partners to
develop power projects either from its own resources or those offered by others; and (f) introducing
two-part bulk tariff, comprising a fixed-cost part and a variable-cost part, which allows NTPC to
set its tariff under the fixed cost part well in line with the LRMC and pass fuel price variations to
the consumers under the variable part. The fixed-cost part of the tariff will, however, slowly (in
line with inflation) fall below the LRMC as assets are not revalued.
Financial Aspects
9.    NTPC's operating data, summarized in the table below, reflect the significant growth
the Corporation experienced. During the last seven years, from FY88 to FY94, generating
capacity was added continuously at an average annual rate of 26% and the value of average net
fixed assets grew at an average annual rate of 29%. The pace of growth, however, has been
declining. The level of capital investment has been stagnant since FY91 (except for an increase
in FY92 due to the transfer of Unchahar assets to NTPC). During FY88-94 capital investment
grew annually at a rate of 5 %, but in real termns the growth rate was negative (-5 %). Capital
works in progress remained flat from FY88 to FY91, but there has been some modest increase
since FY92.

10.   A more detailed tabulation of NTPC's actual financial performance as compared to the
SAR projections made at the time of appraisal, can be found in Part III, Table 12.
11.   At the end of FY94, NTPC was in a relatively strong financial position. Only 47% of
its capital structure was funded through long-term borrowing, and 53 % was funded through
equity. In contrast, the debt capital funding in most power utilities around the world ranges
from 60% to 80%.
12.   NTPC's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been increasing, and at the end
of FY94 about 60% of its long-term debt was denominated in foreign currencies. NTPC's net
income is protected from exchange rate and fuel price fluctuations through its cost based tariff
policy. NTPC's return on net average fixed assets in operation (historically valued) declined
from a high of 16% in FY88 to 13% in FY91 and FY93. The main reason for the decline was
the non-recovery of higher capital costs of 500MW plants whose output was priced on the
basis of the capital costs of 200 MW plants conimissioned earlier. With the notification of
revised tariffs in 1993 the declining trend in the rate of return has been reversed, and in FY94
it climbed back to 17%. The returns achieved were well in excess of the rates required under
the financial covenants (7% through FY90 and 9.5% during FY91 through FY95). At the end
of FY94, NTPC's debt service coverage was 1.98 and its current ratio was 2.55, indicating
that NTPC had adequate resources to service its long-term debt and to pay off its current
obligations as well.



- 5 -
13.   Billing and collection have been persistent problems for NTPC for a long time, because
of the poor financial situation of many SEBs and the lack of an appropriate contractual
framework. A covenant specifying the level of accounts receivable not to exceed an amount
equivalent to the proceeds of NTPC's sales of power for the two preceding months, was first
introduced for NTPC under Ln. 2555-IN for the Rihand Power Transmission Project
(approved in May 1985) with effect from the end of the FY86. The covenant was repeated in
three subsequent loans including Ln.2674-IN, but NTPC has never been able to comply. At
the end of FY90, NTPC's level of accounts receivable had risen to seven months of sales
equivalent. At that tirne Bank management decided not to exercise the remedies available
under the loan agreement such as suspension of disbursements, partly because of concern about
jeopardizing India's ongoing development program. Other non-power sector reasons might be
that the Bank was also worried about the impact of such a suspension of disbursements on the
overall India-Bank relations and on the level of disbursements to India, when India was
experiencing an economic crisis. However, the Bank decided to cancel in mid-1990, the
processing of a new loan of US$375 million to NTPC after completion of the negotiations.
14.   To help correct the situation, GOI took in June 1990 the drastic measure of allowing
NTPC through the Central Appropriations (CA), to recover over a period of four years, Rs.
10,205 million of arrears accumulated as of the end of May 31, 1990. In February 1992,
NTPC acquired the Unchahar power station from the Government of Uttar Pradesh in lieu of
arrears (about Rs 4,800 million) accumulated by UPSEB. In October 1992, GOI agreed to
recover an additional amount of Rs. 7,500 million of arrears through CA over a period of four
years. Combined with other bill collection efforts, NTPC was able to reduce its level of
accounts receivable despite the rapid increase in sales. In FY92, NTPC realized about 79% of
total billing in cash from the SEBs, but combined with the CA and the take over of Unchahar,
bill realization rose to 99% and at the end of the fiscal year the level of accounts receivable
had come down to 3.4 months of sales equivalent. In FY93, NTPC realized 81% of billing in
cash from the SEBs and 91% including payments made by GOI through CA. At the end of the
fiscal year, the level of accounts receivable in terms of months of sales equivalent was about
3.3 months, but excluding the amount still to be paid through CA it was about 1.4 months of
sales equivalent.
15.   In early-1993, during the preparation and negotiations of the NTPC Power Generation
Project. GOI adopted new commercial and investment policies for NTPC which allowed it to
shut-off or restrict power to the SEBs in case of non-compliance with agreed terns of supply.
As part of the conditionality agreed under the said project, the Bank agreed that for the
purpose of monitoring compliance with the two months accounts receivable covenant, the
amounts still due from CA were to be excluded. As of March 31, 1993 (end of FY93), NTPC
was in compliance with the accounts receivable covenant thus modified. Based on this data,
Ln. 3632-IN for the above mentioned NTPC Power Generation Project was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors in June 1993. However, during the first three months of FY94



- 6 -
(April to June 1993), NTPC bill collection performance dropped again to about 72% and there
was little evidence that NTPC was applying the newly adopted commercial policies by
regulating power to defaulting SEBs. On October 21, 1993, the Bank advised GOI that unless
NTPC's level of accounts receivable was brought down to 2 months of sales equivalent by
January 15, 1994, the Bank would, with effect from that date, suspend India's rights to make
withdrawals from Ln.2844-IN (National Capital Power Project) and from the generation
component of Ln.2845-IN (Talcher Thermal Power Project) until NTPC was in compliance
with the agreed receivable covenant. NTPC was also informed that Ln.3632-IN would not be
declared effective until NTPC was in compliance with the receivable covenant. Ln.2674-IN
was excluded because the loan was closed on December 31, 1993. On February 2, 1994, the
Bank agreed to keep formal suspension actions in abeyance up to May 1994, in recognition of
NTPC's progress in dealing with its bill collection problems and its applications of the new
commercial policies, while GOI and NTPC agreed to refrain from submitting withdrawal
applications under Ln 2844 and 2845-IN from March 1, 1994..
16.   As part of the conditionality agreed under Ln. 3632-IN, NTPC was to conclude new
Bulk Power Supply Agreements and tariffs had to be notified for all stations because lack of a
transparent and agreed basis of billing had been the cause of several billing disputes between
NTPC and the SEBs. In April 1994, NTPC had, for the first time in its history, commercial
contracts in place for all its power stations. Another round of CA to recover arrears
accumulated since 1992 was approved in May 1994. Total realization of current bills
(excluding the amounts recovered through CA) improved to 92 % for FY94. In particular,
from July 1993 to March 1994, realization of current bills was 98% and in the last three
months of the fiscal year it was 105%. All these actions combined with improved bill
collection and better application of the new commercial policies, led to the Bank lifting the
above mentioned informal suspension and declaring Ln.3236-IN effective on June 6, 1994.
Although relations between the Bank and, GOI and NTPC were tense at times, the Bank's
persistence on commercial behavior by NTPC have led to positive results and is, in fact, much
appreciated now by NTPC. Although not all problems have been resolved in the Northern
region and another warning had to be issued by the Bank in October 1994, the cumulative
realization of current bills for the period April to December 1994 has been 102% and the level
of accounts receivable as of December 31, 1994, was 1.7 months of sales equivalent
(excluding the amount still to be recovered through CA). Status of NTPC's accounts
receivable is being followed up by the Bank on a monthly basis.
17.   Combination of improved accounts receivables position and a stagnant investment
program resulted in a better self-financing ratio for NTPC in FY94. Since FY90 the self-
financing ratio has been improving steadily, and in FY94, contribution of internal funds to
capital expenditure (3-year average) was 47.6%, well above the 20% required in the covenant
introduced under Ln. 3632-IN. This also brings out a flaw in the self-financing ratio



requirement which simply considers the ratio of internal cash generation to investrnent needs,
and if the investments are not growing the ratio may not be that meaningful.
18.   The financial strength of NTPC has put the Corporation in a position to raise funds in
both the domestic and international markets. Currently NTPC has the fimancial capability to
accelerate the implementation of its investment program, but so far NTPC has not exploited
this opportunity to expand its assets base.
Project Objectives
19.   The primary objective of the project was to help meet the demand for electricity in the
Northern and Western Regions of India by providing additional power generation capacity of about
1,500 MW using combined cycle technology to provide an efficient, reliable, and economic source of
power. Secondary objectives of the project were to diversify the fuels used in power generation
through the use of gas or liquid fuels in regions that were short of hydro and coal resources; relieve
pressure on the railways and the coal sectors; and introduce the combined cycle technology in India.
Project Description
20.   The project comprised the following components, as established at appraisal:
(a)  three combined cycle power plants - at Anta (Rajasthan), Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh) and
Kawas (Gajarat) -- comprising combustion turbogenerators, heat recovery boilers and
steam turbine-generators, with a total installed capacity of about 1,500 MW; electrical
and mechanical auxiliary equipment; associated civil works and ancillary facilities;
(b)   about 950 km of 220 kV and 375 km of 400 kV single-circuit and double-circuit
transmission lines, connecting the Anta station with Bhilwara and Dausa in Rajasthan,
the Auraiya station with Agra and Ballabhgarh in Uttar Pradesh, and the Kawas station
with Navsari, Bharuch and Valthan in Gujarat, together with new or extended
substations and associated auxiliaries; and
(c)   technical assistance for engineering, testing and commissioning of the combined cycle
power stations.
Project Design and Organization
21.   The feasibility report of the project was prepared jointly by NTPC and its consultants in
September 1985 (Part I, para. 4). The basic design was completed in 1986. The project was initially
conceived to install about 1,500 MW of power, using natural gas and the combined cycle technology
for the first tirne in India. The primary fuel was to be natural gas with liquid fuel as its alternate in the



- 8 -
event quantity of the gas supplied fell short of requirements. The gas was to be provided essentially
from the off-shore South Bassein gas field and through the Hazira-Bijaypur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) gas
pipeline. As bids were received, the total installed generating capacity of the three plants, with the
specified design parameters, added up to 1,709 MW (Part I, para. 19). The combined cycle concept
features a waste heat recovery boiler installed at the discharge of each combustion turbine to recover
the thermal energy in the combustion turbine exhaust to generate steam and supply it at high pressure
and temperature to a conventional steam turbine. Electricity is thus generated in separate generators,
those coupled to each combustion turbine and one coupled to the steam turbine. The thermal
efficiency of a combined cycle power plant is therefore, much higher than that of other conventional
forms of power generation. The overall design of the power plants reflects state-of-the-art for
combined cycle power plant technologies at the time.
22.   The final configuration of the three power plants was as follows:

23.   NTPC, at the time of appraisal, had a three-tier organization structure: Corporate !evel,
Regional level and Project level. The organization changed over time to answer NTPC's uhanging
responsibilities, from a fully investment-oriented enterprise towards a public utility. NTPC
underwent a major organizational change on August 16, 1991, following GOI's decision to entrLst
the transmission assets (operation and maintenance, as well as those under construction) to the
National Power Transmission Corporation, later renamed as Power Grid Corporation of India, Ltd
(POWERGRID). Subsequently, on January 8, 1993, the NTPC, NHPC and NEEPCO
(Acquisition and Transfer of Power Transmission Systems) Ordinance, 1993, promulgated by the
President of India, provided for the transfer of transmission systems of these entities, including all
the rights, titles and other interests related to the transmission systems of each of the corporations
retroactively with effect from 1 April 1992.
24.   The Corporation is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), who is assisted
by five full-time functional Directors: for Projects, Technical, Operations, Finance, and Personnel.



- 9 -
At the corporate office, Corporate Planning, Central Procurement and Vigilance functions are
headed by Executive Directors reporting to the CMD. For the purpose of administration and
execution of work at the sites, the Corporation is divided into five regions - North, West, South,
East and National Capital -- whose headquarters are located at Allahabad, Nagpur, Hyderabad,
Patna and Delhi respectively. These regions are under the control of Regional Executive Directors
who are responsible for the implementation and operation and maintenance of power plants in their
respective regions. Each power plant is headed by a General Manager, reporting to the Regional
Executive Director.
Project Implementation
25.   Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup. Loan 2674-IN was approved by the Board on
April 1, 1986; the Loan Agreement was signed on October 27, 1986. Signing of a contract
between ONGC and GAIL for the construction of the HBJ pipeline and the signing of a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between GOI and NTPC were conditions of loan
effectiveness. These conditions took a long time to satisfy and the last date of effectiveness of the
loan had to be extended twice. The loan became effective on 27 March 1987.
26.   Investment approval of the project by GOI (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) took
an inordinately long time. While CEA's techno-economic clearance was accorded in October
1985, the feasibility report was scrutinized by various government agencies until the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs decided to have the gas pricing policy for the power sector
finalized by a group of Ministers prior to making the investment decision for the project. But the
project was conceived with a definite schedule of implementation, dictated by the demand growth
in the regions. For the Combined Cycle Power Project, the situation was quite critical as the areas
where the power plants were to be built were already suffering from acute power shortages.
Because of GOI's delay in approving the project, bid opening had to be deferred from February
1986 to November 1986. Thus, the project implementation schedule that was negotiated with the
Bank, had to be revised at the very outset. If this delay of nine months is quantified in terms of
cost to the national economy, it would translate to a staggering figure of approximately Rs. 232.5
billion (23,250 crores in Indian terms, or US$ 7,416 million) equivalent at 70 per cent PLF, if it is
assumed that the cost of unserved energy is a modest Rs. 30/kWh.
27.   Implementation Schedule. By project appraisal, NTPC had already completed the basic
design for the proposed project. Bids for the major contracts were invited in February 1986, before
Board date, and it was envisaged that contract awards would be announced in December 1986. The
transmission components were scheduled for completion by June 1989. Project completion was set
at appraisal for 1990. However, bid opening for the main plant package had to be extended till the
receipt of investment approval of the project by GOI, as well as signing of the loan agreement
between the Bank and GOI. Both these activities were completed in October 1986, facilitating



- 10 -
opening of the bids in November 1986. This extension of the bid opening date resulted in
consequent delays in the project schedule.
28.   Implementation Process. Contract packaging was done on the basis of one turnkey contract
for each power plant. After opening of the bids in November 1986, bid evaluation was completed
in June 1987. Contract awards, however, could be made to the respective lowest evaluated bidders
for Anta and Auraiya only, in August 1987 and September 1987 respectively.
29.   Contract award for Kawas was delayed owing to protracted and inconclusive pre-award
discussion with the lowest evaluated bidder. Basically, it stemmed from the winning bidder's
(GFiAlsthom) refusal to accept the liability clauses as provided for in the bidding documents. The
Bank had originally recommended that, in view of the inconclusive pre-award discussions with the
winning bidder, the award for Kawas be made to the second lowest evaluated bidder (MHI, Japan)
based on the original bids, but NTPC preferred not to accept the Bank's recommendation because
the value of the Japanese Yen was appreciating rapidly and suspected that the fial price of the
contract would continue to remain fluid and uncertain. NTPC therefore decided to have a
rebidding for the Kawas plant; the Bank concurred. Bids were invited in September 1988, from a
total of 6 bidders, including those who had submitted bids in response to the original invitation.
Bids were received from 4 bidders only; but the rebid prices were found to be much higher than
those in the original bid proposals due to the variation in the Rs-$-Yen exchange rates in the
interim, as noted above, that was further exacerbated by local inflation. By the time bid evaluation
was completed, the original bid validity period had already expired. The winning bidder expressed
its inability to deliver in accordance with the schedule specified in the bid documents. NTPC
would not consider the second lowest evaluated bidder, because one of its combustion turbines of
similar design had suffered failure elsewhere, and recommended the contract be awarded to the
third lowest evaluated bidder. The Bank did not accept this recommendation as the reasons given
by NTPC were deemed insufficient for rejecting the lowest or the next lowest evaluated bidders.
The Bank also felt that it was unreasonable to adhere to the original delivery dates stipulated in the
bid documents when there had been a delay of 4 months in awarding the contract. Upon the Bank
making its views very clear, and under threat of cancellation of the balance of the loan, NTPC
entered into negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder, resolved the differences, and finally
awarded the Contract in March 1990.
30.   Procurement. The project was implemented on the basis of single turnkey contracts for
each of the power stations, covering the Combustion Turbines and the Combined Cycle Modules
primarily dictated by Perfornance Guarantee reasons. Consultant services were also funded under
the Bank loan. NTPC had initially suggested to split the contracts into several packages for each of
the plants, but this could not be supported by the Bank because procurement through a single
supplier on a turnkey basis, offered simplified supervision and project irnplementation, as well as
facilitate training of the staff, since the three combined cycle units were scheduled to be



- 11 -
commissioned within a year of each other. Experience with project irnplementation confirmed the
validity of these assumptions.
31.   In accordance with the Project Agreement, associated civil works and erection were also
made part of the respective turkey contracts for the three plants. International competitive bidding
procedures were followed, and it was agreed during loan negotiations that the Industrial Formula
for Domestic Preference would apply, since a significant domestic capability was expected to cater
to some of the major equipment supplies. In the end, however, it was not necessary to apply this
formula. To assist NTPC in carrying out the project, consultants were employed based on the
Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants, whose terns and conditions of employment
were satisfactory to the Bank.
32.   The Bank had expressed concern to NTPC management on a number of occasions that the
time spent on bid evaluation and for the approval of contract awards was too long and that
appropriate measures should be taken to simplify the bidding process. NTPC should consider how
to introduce better efficiency in procurement. Being an autonomous corporation with full
accountability to the government for its actions, NTPC should make its own procurement decisions
independent of any external involvement in the process. Specifically, the lengthy procurement
process and the delays in making timely decision caused serious disruptions in the implementation
schedule for the Kawas Combined Cycle Power Plant.
33.   It needs to be recognized that a bidder has the right to ask for adjustments in the price of its
bid if there are delays in making the contract award beyond the original bid validity period. The
price adjustment is admissible based on commercial principles that recognize the movement, in the
interim, of internationally published indices for material and labor that the bidder might have used
to develop the price of its product or services. The bidder is, however, required to substantiate its
claim for the price increase. This principle has been enshrined in the new procurement guidelines
of the Bank that provides for automatic adjustment of the bid price (in case of fixed-price bids) in
case of such delays. In any case, this matter should not have been an issue because the bid
documents provided for price adjustment during the course of project implementation based on the
movement of the variable indices. Similarly, procurement should be completed within the bid
validity period. In the event bid validity is extended, the bidders' right to extend the
implementation schedule correspondingly, should also be recognized.
34.   Contract award recommendations of NTPC in respect of the Anta and the Auraiya plants
were accepted by the Bank. There was one instance of representation by a consultant against not
opening its priced bid although it considered its proposal to be technically at par with the other
proposals. The bid evaluation procedure stipulated that NTPC would rate the technical merit of the
proposals first and open priced bids only of those that scored above a predetennined threshold. The
bidder accepted NTPC's explanation. There was a complaint from one of the other bidders over
the bid evaluation in respect of Kawas combined cycle plant, where it was relegated from a higher



- 12 -
to a lower rank in accordance with the evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents.
NTPC's position in this matter was tenable and the complainant did not pursue the matter when
explained the rationale behind the bid evaluation process.
Project Performance
35.   Serious teething problems and operational difficulties were experienced in all three
power plants during the commissioning phase. It took several months for the required
modifications to be identified and implemented to stabilize the operation of these plants. It is
curious to note that, even though the manufacturers of the three plants were different the
combustion turbine components in all three plants suffered damage due to high temperatures
and inadequate clearances between the compressor rotor and the casing. For more details, refer
to Part III, Annex A.
36.   The technical specifications called for dual-fuel firing capability in all units, but the
installation of the alternate liquid fuel firing system at the Kawas plant was deleted by NTPC as
desired by GOI, on basis of an assurance given by GAILIONGC that gas would be made available
at all times for this plant. Even though no written contract was signed by any party to this effect,
the recommendation for the deletion of alternate fuel firing capability at the Kawas plant bound
GAIL/ONGC to a tacit commitment to keep it supplied with the required quantity of gas. Now
that there has been a failure of that commitment, NTPC has had to award a supplementary contract
to GEC/Alsthom for the installation, at NTPC's cost, of alternate fuel firing capability in all four
combustion turbines. The contract was signed in May 1994, to be implemented over a period of 18
months. Gas supply to the plant has become sporadic with the result that the plant has to be shut
down every now and then for the non-availability of gas. The plant has to live with this situation
until the dual-fuel firing capability is installed.
37.   The associated 220 kV and 400 kV transmission lines, even though not funded under
the Bank loan, were commissioned into service on time to facilitate evacuation of power from
the three power plants. Since August 1991, the said transmission facilities are being managed
by POWERGRID (Part I, para.23).
Merit Order Dispatch and Fuel Pricing
38.   In order to derive a merit order for generation dispatch purposes, it is usual to rank
generating units in order of their short run marginal costs: the costs of production excluding
fixed charges associated with meeting capital requirements, operation and maintenance costs
and other fixed costs that would exist whether the units generate or not. The marginal cost for
scheduling purposes should only be the cost of producing the next kWh of output. In
accordance with a GOI notification, the tariff associated with the output of each centrally
owned power station, is set notionally in two parts; in terms of a capacity charge and an



- 13 -
energy charge. However, the way these tariffs operate is such as to make them appear as one
part tariffs based on energy drawn by the SEBs. This apparent energy charge does not relate
solely to the short run marginal cost of the stations; instead, it lumps together capital items
with marginal operating cost items which makes the cost of the next kWh of production, as
viewed by the SEBs, appear to be high in relation to their own real short run cost of
production. The result is that it is cheaper for the SEBs to generate on their own inefficient
units rather than to import from the central stations. The prevailing distortions as a result of
the GOI notification and the administered fuel pricing, need to be removed as early as
possible.
Environmental Impacts
39.   During construction, the project had only minor environmental impact. Operation of
gas based combined cycle power plants present significantly less environmental problems than
those created by coal-fired power stations, since natural gas is a much cleaner fuel to burn, and
the project requires far less land. The sulfur content of the natural gas used in the power
plants built under the project is very low. Also, due to natural gas having a larger hydrogen-
to-carbon ratio than coal, its combustion automatically releases less CO2. The combustion
turbines were specifically designed to minimize NO, emission. Cooling water requirement for
the plants also is minimal because cooling towers were built. Effluent water from the power
stations is neutralized in waste water treatment plants. Sound attenuation provides safety
against unacceptable noise levels.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R)
40.   The project entailed acquisition of about 391 acres (158 ha) for Anta, 298 acres (121
ha) for Auraiya, and 568 acres (230 ha) for the Kawas power plants. Land acquisition was
completed satisfactorily. Project Affected Persons (PAP) were compensated by cash payment
in accordance with GOI regulations. Some of the PAPs found permanent jobs at the plants.
Others were helped to start businesses of their own; such as, maintenance contracts, shops,
etc. Community development schemes in the affected villages were implemented.
41.   NTPC operates in several states and to ensure a common approach, it formalized in
1993 its own comprehensive R&R policy for PAPs. This policy is consistent with the Bank's
operational directives. With the adoption of the formalized and comprehensive R&R policy,
NTPC is reappraising the already completed the resettlement component of the Combined
Cycle Project to make sure that the objectives of the basic R&R policy have been met. These,
inter alia, include ensuring that the PAPs improve, or at least regain, their previous standard
of living. Details of R&R measures are included in Part III, Annex A.

Project Costs
42.   At appraisal, the total cost of the project, including the transmission component,
contingencies, taxes and duties, but without interest during construction, was estimated at about Rs.
16,143 million (US$ 1,241.3 million equivalent at an exchange rate of US$ = Rs. 13.00), of
which Rs. 8,663 million (US$ 665.6 million) represented the foreign exchange cost. The actual
cost of the project, including the transmission component, was Rs. 26,567 million (US$ 1,229.7
million equivalent at an average exchange rate of US$=Rs.21.60), representing an increase by
about 65 percent in rupee terms. An increase of Rs. 9,754.2 million was due to the devaluation of
the rupee with respect to the US dollar.
43.   Taxes and duties were estimated in the SAR at Rs. 1,653 million (US$ 127.3 million
equivalent). The project was exempted by GOI from the levy of Customs Duty on imports of the
plant equipment. Sales Tax and Excise Duties were also not applicable for imported equipment.
The taxes and duties, however, were paid on local supplies only which constituted an insignificant
part of the total procurement under the project. It is estimated that taxes and duties paid for the
Mechanical/Electrical Works amounted to Rs. 243.6 million (US$ 11.3 million equivalent) and
those for the Transmission System another Rs. 337 million (US$ 15.6 million equivalent) for a total
of Rs. 580.6 million (US$ 26.9 million equivalent). The estimate in the SAR for interest during
construction was Rs. 929.3 million (US$ 44.7 million equivalent); the actual amount was
Rs.2,405.1 million (US$ 111.4 million equivalent).
Disbursements.
44.   The estimated and actual disbursements under the loan are given in Part IH, Table 4. The
delays that occurred at the start of the project, coupled with equipment problems experienced in all
three power plants that delayed contract closeout, adversely affected the disbursements. The actual
disbursements were thus later than the appraisal estimates which projected that the loan would be
closed by 31 December 1991. The closing date of the loan had to be extended twice, by one year
each time, to 31 December 1993, to allow for completion of procurement and disbursements. The
loan amount of US$ 485.0 million equivalent was fully disbursed by 2 June 1994.
Project Results
45.   Overall, the project was successful in meeting its principal objectives of: (a) providing the
Northern and Western Regions of India with the much needed power; (b) diversifying the fuels
used in power generation through the use of natural gas or liquid fuels; (c) relieving pressure on the
railway and the coal sector; and (d) introducing into India the combined cycle technology.
46.   The physical targets of the generation components were achieved, albeit behind the original
schedule set at appraisal due to delays described in Part I, paras. 23 and 29, which caused the



- 15 -
commissioning schedule for the generating units to be revised even before the project got started.
However, NTPC's performance with respect to the respective construction schedules, revised at the
time of award of contracts, was highly satisfactory. All generating units in the Anta Combined
Cycle Plant were commissioned by NTPC ahead of the revised schedule. For the Auraiya
Combined Cycle Plant, while the units were synchronized close to the revised schedule, there were
delays in placing the units in commercial operation due to serious operational difficulties that led to
extensive modifications of the combustion turbines and other components. The Kawas Combined
Cycle Plant was delayed due to rebidding, and the length of time NTPC took to make contract
award decisions; however, the units were synchronized ahead of the revised schedule. But
conmmercial operation was delayed due to serious equipment problems in the initial stages of
operation. The transmission component, not financed by the Bank, was commissioned in time to
facilitate evacuation of power from the respective plants. The HBJ gas line was installed on
schedule for the generating units to operate on natural gas. However, fuel supply constraints at the
Kawas plant are now affecting generation.
47.   The project assisted in the transfer of know-how through the construction of the first ever
combined cycle power plant in India. NTPC engineers were trained abroad in engineering and
design aspects, as well as in the construction management and operation and maintenance of such
power plants.
48.   The covenanted requirement for NTPC to reduce recoverables to less than two months of
billing, which was finally accomplished towards the close of the project on current billing, helped
NTPC improve its financial standing.
Project Financing
49.   The Bank loan of US$ 485.0 million equivalent was envisaged to provide for 39 percent of
the total project cost, net of duties and taxes and IDC, and expected to cover about 73 percent of
the estimated foreign cost of the project. The balance of the foreign exchange financing
requirement, amounting to US$221 million was to be met from external borrowing or GOI foreign
exchange reserves. The remainder was to be arranged by NTPC through internal cash generation
plus equity and loans from GOI. Financing remained basically in line with the one envisaged at
appraisal (Part III, Table 7B). The final project cost was of US$ 1,229.7 million equivalent,
inclusive of contingencies, taxes and duties, interest during constnuction. The share of the Bank
financing was 39.4 percent of the total project cost. About US$ 437 million of the Bank loan was
utilized for irnports, and the balance of US$ 48 million was used for financing expenditures in local
currency. Cofinancing was provided by: (i) International Bank of Japan (US$ 138.1 million
equivalent); (ii) French Banks (US$ 416.7 million equivalent); (iii) Belgian Banks (US$ 56.4
million equivalent); and (iv) Domestic Resources (US$ 133.5 million equivalent).

Economic Rate of Return
50.   Benefits of the three power stations included in the project could not be readily separated from
those of other investments in generation, transmission and distribution in the Northern and Western
Regions. Therefore, an economnic analysis was carried out based on the "time slices" of investment
programs of the two regions. Capital costs of the investment programns (covering generation,
transmission and distribution) together with incremental operating and fuel costs are given in Part [H
T ables 8A and 8B. The benefits of the investment program relate mainly to the incremental
consumption which they make possible. A minirnum measure of benefits, ignoring consumer surplus,
wvas then derived from incremental sales revenue. Electricity tariffs in application for each power plant
were expressed in constant November 1994 prices. A Standard Conversion Factor of 0.9 was used.
On this basis, the ex-ante internal rate of return ([ERR) achieved by the Northern region is 16%, as
against an appraisal estimate of 3%. The ex-ante [ERR for the Western Region on the same basis
works out at 14%, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 7%.
Project Sustainability
51.   The project is sustainable for the following reasons: (a) the demand for the output of each of
the power stations exists in the two regions; and (b) the curren t tariff setting procedures and tariffs are
adequate enough to permit recovery of capital and operating costs. The new two-part tariffs, which
were introduced 1 November 1992, would serve to reinforce incentives to operate the plants efficiently
and with high availability. However, availability of gas at the three power plants needs to be ensured.
There is a continuing shortfall in the gas supply to all three power plants and ONGC/GAIL are unable
to meet the supplies stipulated in the original linkage. Specifically, non-availability of gas is seriously
affecting the operation of the Kawas plant (Part I, para. 36).



- 17 -
52.   The initial teething problems of the power plants, which were of serious nature, have been
resolved. Except for the Kawas plant which has gas availability problems, the PLF and availability
achieved in 1993-94 have been quite impressive, as shown below:
Station              Capacity Factor (PLF). %        Availability Factor
Anta                         71.7                         83.7

Kawas                         42.9                         50.0
Bank Performance
53.   The performance of the Bank from project preparation through project completion was by and
large satisfactory. The Bank had good relations with GOI and NTPC throughout the execution of the
project and fostered an environment conducive to increased Bank interaction with NTPC, in spite of
occasional tensions during the procurement of the Kawas Power Plant and during the period remedies
were brought by GOI and NTPC to NTPC's the accounts receivable problem. However, NTPC's
unsatisfactory accounts receivable position and its failure to meet the associated loan covenants, should
have been dealt with more finnly and remedies under the ongoing loan agreements should have been
invoked much earlier to correct the situation. To date, the Bank Group has assisted NTPC in
imnplementing in all 15 projects, with a total loan of about US$ 4 billion. The Bank has had enough
leverage to strengthen the institutional and financial viability of NTPC through firm actions.
54.   The Bank has also continued to address a number of shortcomings of broader sectoral concem
in the operations of NTPC, with appreciable success. The major items are:
(a)    Transformation of NTPC from a construction-oriented organization to one of the
largest generating utilities in the developing world;
(b)   Introduction of two-part tariff to help mobiLization of resources from internal cash
generation to finance investment programs. However, the intended benefit has not yet
been derived due to global accounting system exercised through the regional SEBs, as
described in Part I, para.38, which is an obstacle to merit order dispatching. A study
has been made as a part of POWERGRID operations and its recommendations are to
be implemented through the POWERGRID System Development Project (Ln.3577-
IN);
(c)   Implementation of the new commercial and investment policies, agreed under Ln.3632-
IN, and,
(d)   Adoption of a more comprehensive and up-front approach towards environmental
protection and R&R issues. An Environmental Action plan, aimed to complement



- 18 -
earlier efforts, has already been drawn up for all NTPC power projects, including the
Combined Cycle Project.
Borrower Performance
55.   Part III, Table 1, contains the review of performance of the Borrowers and the Implementing
Agencies. The performance of GOI was less than satisfactory because of the delay in according
investment approval of the project. Performance of NTPC was satisfactory in respect of
implementation and compliance with covenants, except for NTPC's less than satisfactory performance
in the procurement of the Kawas Power Plant and the covenant requiring receivables to be reduced to
less than 60 days of billing. It was only towards the end of the project that NTPC finally satisfied this
covenant in respect of current billing.
56.   The performnance of NTPC in project implementation was generally satisfactory because the
project objectives were met in the end. The following deficiencies were, however, noteworthy: (a)
lengthy procurement cycles and delayed contract awards (Part I, paras. 25-30, 32 and 33); and (b)
equipment problems (Part I, paras. 35 and 36). NTPC was finally able to overcome these problems
and place the three plants in commercial operation.
57.   Positive contributions by NTPC to the project consisted of the following: (a) Key operation
and maintenance personnel, including the engineering and managerial staff were given intensive
training and involved in the installation of the equipment during the construction phase of the project,
with concentration on the preoperational phases of activity such as planning, design and construction;
(b) the senior management and site management of NTPC paid close attention to the coordination and
monitoring of all headquarters and field activities, equipment supplies, transport, erection services and
commissioning; and (c) a sound reporting system and supervision strategy was established and daily
reports from various fronts at the different sites were obtained. The analysis of these reports provided
the right tool to intervene appropriately to avoid delays.
Comparison of Financial Aspects with Combined Cycle SAR Forecasts
58.   Viewed in isolation, the statistics presented in Part I, para. 9, and Part III, Tables 12A,
12B and 12C, indicate that NTPC's operational and financial performance have been successful.
Capacity addition and generation of electricity increased at high rates, and rates of return were
higher than the returns required according to the covenants. However, while electricity
generation and revenues were comparable to forecasts in the SAR, capital investments and net
fixed assets were significantly below the forecast levels.
59.   At the end of FY94 investments were only about half of their projected level, and net fixed
assets were 43.5% lower than expectations. Fuel costs have been considerably higher in recent
years (in 1994 fuel costs were 33.3% higher than SAR forecasts) leading to higher operating



- 19 -
expenses. Actual fuel costs grew 50.0% per year against a forecast of 45.8% increase per year,
but growth of operation and maintenance costs was slower (actual 40.5% against a forecast of
38.5%). Actual bulk tariff in 1994 was comparable to the SAR forecasts, but the SAR forecasts
of tariff were based on a lower level of operating expense, and therefore, the actual tariff was
insufficient to generate the rates of return assumed in the SAR. The actual operating profit was
33.3% lower than SAR forecasts. Interest costs charged to revenue were considerably lower than
the projections, because of lower levels of borrowing and lower interest rates (average interest
rates assumed in the SAR during the 90s were 9-10% but the actual average turned out to be 4-
5%). Therefore, although the operating income before interest was much less than SAR
forecasts, net income after interest usually exceeded the forecasts.
60.   In summary, although NTPC's operational and financial performance have been
satisfactory, except with respect to bill collection (Part I, para. 13), they have been well below the
level of performance predicted in the SAR forecasts. The reasons are several - there have been
delays in project implementation leading to lower levels of assets; lags in proper tariff notification
have led to lower revenues; problems in bill collection and maintaining a larger inventory of spare
parts have limited NTPC's internal contribution to new investments; NTPC had occasional
problems in receiving external financial assistance as well as raising capital in domestic markets
which further eroded its capacity expansion program. Timely resolution of these problems would
have resulted in an even better performance record.
Project Relationship
61.   The Bank's relationship with NTPC and with the GOI has been good, in spite of occasional
tension during the resolution of the accounts receivable problem.
Consulting Services
62. Two international and one Indian consultants carried out the project feasibility studies and laid
down the basic design parameters for the three combined cycle power plants, provided detailed
engineering and design services. Performance of the consultants have been satisfactory except that the
Consultants for detailed engineering could have foreseen the difficulties encountered furing
commissioning, as described in Part I, para.35. From the initiation of the project till completion,
project engineering review meetings, development of the detailed equipment specifications, and final
layouts were held regularly in NTPC's offices in New Delhi. Later these review meetings were also
extended to the individual sites to resolve site specific questions. Transfer of knowledge was accorded
priority. NTPC seconded its own engineers to form part of the consultants' engineering and design,
project management and supervisory teams. Consultants were also responsible for the full quality
assurance program at contractor's works, and assisted in expediting supplies of the equipment on
schedule, thereby helping flesh out problems as they arose.



- 20 -
Project Documentation and Data
63.   The project's legal arrangements adequately reflected the Bank's interests in achieving the
objectives of the project. The SAR of the project provided a very useful framework for both the Bank
and the Borrower during project implementation.
64.   NTPC regularly submitted quarterly progress reports for the project. These have been
used for review of physical and financial performance as well as for planning the visits of the
supervision missions to India which often included site visits in addition to review meetings at
NTPC's corporate head quarters in New Delhi.
65.   NTPC has provided a completion report for the project and subsequent additional financial
information. The NTPC report consisted of the first draft of Parts I and III of the report based on
which this Project Completion Report has been finalized.

Annex A
Construction of Individual Plants under the Project
The contracts for all three plants were to be awarded in December 1986 in accordance with the
original implementation schedule.
Anta Combined Cycle Power Plant
I.     The main plant package was awarded in August 1987. The commissioning of the plant,
that is synchronizing and placing in commercial operation, took place in accordance with the
following schedule:
Event                  SAR Schedule   Revised Schedule  Actual/Sync.1'  Commercial Operation
Contract Award         December 86                     August 87
Combustion Turbine 1   April 89       August 89       January 89             April 89
Combustion Turbine 2   June 89        October 89       March 89              May 89
Combustion Turbine 3   August 89      December 90      May 89                July 89
Steam Turbine 1        October 90     August 90        March 90              August 90
1/ Synchoized
2.     Significant problems were experienced during initial operation of the combustion turbines; such
as, dislodging of blade tips in the first stage moving blades, bulging of combustor chamber inserts,
cracking of first stage stationary vanes, crack in the hot gas casing collars, cracking of cables, as well as
condenser fouling, and vibration in the generators. The manufacturer performed the required
modifications and successfully rectified the defects. The performance of the plant has since been
satisfactory. Till the end of March 1994, this plant had generated 10,230 GWh of energy (cumulative).
PLF of 1993-94 was 71.7% at an availability factor of 83.7%.
Auraiya Combined Cycle Power Plant
3.     The main plant contract was awarded in September 1987. Plant commissioning was
accomplished in accordance with the following schedule:
Event                  SAR Schedule   Revised Schedule  Actual/Sync.    Commercial Operation
Contract Award         December 86    September 87
Combustion Turbine I   March 89       September 89     March 89              October 90
Combustion Turbine 2   May 89         November 89      July 89               October 90
Combustion Turbine 3   July 89        January 90       August 89             November 90
Combustion Turbine 4   September 89    March 90        September 89          November 90
Steam Turbine I        September 90    November 90     December 89           November 90
Steam Turbine 2        December 90    January 91       June 90               December 90

4.     The plant was beset with serious teething problems, some of which were: Failure of the CT
compressor, shifting of compressor blades and rubbing of blades in CT 1 and 4, combustor basket
failure, passing in guillotine and bypass dampers, cracks in louvers of the bypass dampers, blockage in
air intake filters, etc. Modifications were carried out and the defects were successfully rectified. The
Performance Test of the combined cycle plant, however, was completed in April
1994 because of delays in proving liquid fliel (naphtha) firing capability. Test results were satisfactory.
The plant has since been operating well. Till the end of March 1994, this plant had generated 12,484
GWh of energy (cumulative). PLF in 1993-94 was 61.9% at an availability factor of 72.4%.
Kawas Combined Cycle Power Plant
5.     Award of contract for the Kawas plant was delayed until March 1990. Implementation record
of the plant was as follows:
Event                SAR Schedule   Revised Schedule  ActuaVSync.   Commercial Operation
Contract Award       December 86    March 90
Combustion Turbine I    December 88    March 92  March 92      June 92
Combustion Turbine 2    February 89  May 92      May 92        August 92
Combustion Turbine 3    May 89     July 92       June 92       September 92
Combustion Turbine 4    July 89    September 92    August 92   November 92
Steam Turbine I      April 90      March 93      February 93   November 93
Steam Turbine 2      August 90     July 93       March 93      September 93
6.     Serious operational difficulties were experienced during test operations of the plant. These,
inter alia, were: Burning of combustion Turbine lB generator transformer carbon shield between the
core and the high voltage coiL overheating of neutral side braided flexible connections on Combustion
Turbine I A Generator, repeated tube failures in the high pressure second stage superheater, high
vibration in steam turbine HP exhaust side bearing during start up, etc. These defects were successfully
rectified; however, the superheater problem and the high turbine bearing vibration phenomenon are still
being monitored. Performance Tests were performed on all four combustion turbines operating in the
open cycle mode and on combined cycle block 2. Results of the test were satisfactory. Even though
the plant has since been working satisfactorily, gas supply to the plant is sporadic, with the result that
the entire plant has had to be shut down on many occasions due to non-availability of gas. Meanwhile,
the plant has to live with the generation constraints mentioned above. Till the end of March 1994,
Kawas plant had generated 3,225 GWh of energy (cumulative). PLF of 1993-94 was 42.90/o at an
availability factor of 50%.
7.    It is curious to note that, even though the manufacturers of the three plants were different, the
combustion turbine components in all cases suffered damage due to high temperature, while the
compressor parts got rubbed due to inadequate clearances. At the time these power plants were built,
experience on large combustion turbines, as well as on the combined cycle technology, in general, was
still evolving.

8.    Transmission Lines. Even though not funded under the Bank loan, the associated transmission
lines were a part of the project. The following lines were constructed in time for the evacuation of
power from the combined cycle plants:
Line         Actual Length (ckt. Iam)          Date Commissioned
220 kV Anta-Bhilwara D/C          460                 March 89
220 kV Anta-Jaipur D/C            600                 December 89
220 kV Auraiya-Agra D/C           332                 March 89
400 kV Auraiya-Agra D/C           331                 March 90
400 kV Agra-Ballabhgarh S/C 21    175                 January 92
220 kV Kawas-Navsari D/C          94                  February 92
220 kV Kawas-Valthan D/C          73                  October 90
220 kV Kawas-Bharuch D/C          162                 September 92
1/ Double Circuit  2/ Single Circuit
Since August 1991, the transmission facilities implemented under the project are being managed by the
newly created POWERGRID Ltd. (Part I; para. 21).
Environment. Resettlement and Rehabilitation
9.    The project presents significantly less environmental problems compared to those posed by
coal-fired power stations. Since the natural-gas fuel contains almost no sulfur (less than 0.001 ppm),
the combustion of the gas causes very little atmospheric pollution. Also, due to natural gas having a
larger hydrogen-to-carbon ratio than coal, its combustion automaticaOly releases less CO2. In the event
liquid fuels are required to be used as substitute to natural gas, it is envisaged that these fuels wi1l be
natural gas liquids (NGL) or naphtha, with a low sulfur content, so as not to present increased
environmental emission. The combustion turbine bumers are specifically designed to minimize NO.
emission. Gas samples are regularly analyzed to ensure that ernissions are within permnissible limits. In
the event NO, emission should go beyond permissible lirnits, there is provision for water or steam
iniection in the mac.hine to reduce the production of NO,. The plants, in addition, are equipped with
sound attenuating devices. Plant equipment are designed to a maximum permissible noise level of 90
dB. Owing to the relatively small size of the steam units and the installation of cooling towers for
condenser cooling, the water requirement for each station is minimal (less than I cubic meter per
second). Effluent water quality is monitored on a regular basis and waste water treatment plants have
been installed to neutralize the waste water streams. Green belts have been developed around the
power plants. Safety regulations for the power stations are enforced; NTPC's site record in this respect
for its power plants has been satisfactory. Acquisition of land for the right-of-way for transmission
lines did not pose any significant environmental problems. The transnission lines have been designed
to keep radio interference within acceptable lirnits. GOI environmental standards and regulations are
strictly enforced and monitore.1 on a regular basis.

10.   The implementation of the project at Anta required the acquisition of about 391 acres (158
hectares) of land, out of which 368 acres (149 ha) belonged to private owners, cultivated by some 154
families. None of the families were physically displaced as a result of land acquisition. Loss of land by
the owners was compensated, including by cash payments in accordance with GOI regulations in force
in the late 1980s. 28 of the Project Affected Persons (PAP) found permanent jobs at the plant, 6 were
given maintenance contracts, and 2 were allotted shops. Community development schemes
comprising, inter alia, repairing of pump sets for drinking water, building of approach roads to the
railway station, extension to school buildings, etc., were implemented.
11.   For Auraiya, 512 acres (207 ha) of land was acquired, out of which 298 acres (1 21 ha) was
owned by private owners. PAPs numbered a total of 287; however, only 4 families were actually
displaced. Alternative plots of land were given to these families. The rest of the PAPs received
compensation for the loss of their land. 49 of the PAPs found jobs in NTPC, 6 were given
maintenance contracts, and a number of community development schemes were implemented. Seven
hand pumps were installed to augment drinking water supply, about 500 m of black top road was
constructed, street lighting was provided over a length of 2.5 km.
12.   For the Kawas project, 568 acres (230 ha) of land was acquired of which 227 acres (92 ha)
was private land. There were 51 PAPs in all all of whom have been compensated. 28 PAPs have been
given employment in NTPC. Improving the lot of the PAPs in the surrounding villages has been taken
up by NTPC as the next phase of their community development operation.
13.   NTPC operates in several states and to ensure a common approach, it formalized in 1993 its
own comprehensive R&R policy for PAPs. This policy is consistent with the Bank's operational
directives and applies to all NTPC operations. The basic objective of the policy is to ensure that after a
reasonable transition period, the PAPs improve or at least regain their previous standard of living.
Included in the policy are a number of options, such as, land for land, training to upgrade skills,
allotment of shops with seed money as loan, self-employment with seed money as grant, as well as jobs
with NTPC in the unskilled and semi-skilled categories. The policy also provides for the rehabilitation
of PAPs of existing NTPC projects, if required, who have not been able to regain or improve their past
standard of living.
14.   With the adoption of a formalized and comprehensive R&R policy, NTPC has decided to
reappraise the already implemented resettlement action plans in respect of the PAPs of the
Combined Cycle Project. This is being done through the Community Development Group created in
1993, under the Personnel and Administration Division. The institutional strengthening of NTPC and
manpower development to effectively deal with R&R issues forms an integral part of this plan. In all
three project sites, NTPC has provided developed housing plots to those PAPs who lost their
homestead and has been making efforts to economically rehabilitate them by providing them with
regular employment with NTPC, work with contractors, allotment of shops, award of small contracts,
etc. In most cases, NTPC has upgraded community facilities in the resettlement viDlages and "adopted"

villages in the vicinity of its power projects to improve their economic well being. As part of its R&R
policy, NTPC is also carrying out socioeconomic surveys to ascertain the present economic status of
PAPs. The TOR for this survey was agreed with the Bank and funding is being provided under the
National Power Generation Project (Loan 3632-IN). Based upon the findings, NTPC would: (i) focus
on developing or enhancing community facilities for the benefit of the said PAPs; (ii) provide training
and other assistance to help upgrade their skills and irnprove opportunities for employment; (iii) use its
good offices to enhance improvements through Government assisted programs. The community
facilities would include: establishment of primary schools, medical dispensaries, drinking water wells,
roadways, area street lighting, etc. The surveys in respect of Anta, Auraiya and Kawas were
completed in December 1994, and submitted to the Bank for review. Specific Remedial Action Plans
in accordance with the said R&R Policy are being prepared.
