REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
LOAN 1702-TUN - FIFTH WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of the Fifth Water Supply Project (Loan 1702-TUN) in Tunisia, for which a loan
of US$25 million was made to the "Societ6 Nationale d'Exploitation et de
Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE), the national water supply authority. The
loan was signed in May 1979, became effective in October 1979 and was closed
in December 1983. The project was implemented by SONEDE.
The Fifth Water Supply Project was the first sector lending operation
for water supply in Tunisia financed by the Bank. It was aimed at connecting
an increasing percentage of the urban population to the water network and
expanding public water supply services in the rural areas. Project selection,
design and appraisal was carried out by SONEDE in accordance with a set of
selection criteria and appraisal procedures set out in the Loan Agreement. As
part of the project, a review of development objectives and financial policies
in the sector was also undertaken by SONEDE.
A Bank mission visited Tunis in December 1984 to discuss the prepara-
tion of the project completion report. The operating and financial data,
related to the project implementation and presented in this report, were
provided by SONEDE.
In accordance with revised procedures for project performance audit.
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED),
but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government and the Borrower. However, no ccoments were received.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
LOAN 1702-TUN - FIEFTH WATER SUPPLY "ROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       Loan 1702-TUN of US$25 million was made to "Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE) in May 1979 to help
finance a US$72 million water supply project. The project constituted a major
part of the water supply program included in Tunisia's Fifth Development Plan
(1977-81) and consisted of expanding water supply services in the medium-size
cities and rural areas to raise the percentage of population served by piped
water systems from 64 percent in 1979 to 70 percent by the end of 1981.
Responsibility for the selection of agglomerations where water works were to
be executed, as well as the appraisal cf the works, was delegated to SONEDE
which also carried out construction supervision. As part of the project, a
review of the development objectives and financial policies rn the water
supply sector was undertaken by SONEDE.
2.       The project was successfully implemented and the objectives were
achieved beyond the appraisal expectations. Water works were executed in
eight cities and tweuty-seven rural centers. Water sales increased to
150.5 Mm3 in 1982 from 115.7 Mm3 in 1978. During the same period, the
number of connection lines increased by almost 50 percent frem 349,200 to
514,600. The appraisal had forecasted sales of 143.4 Mm3 and 505,700
connection lines in 1982. The appraisal costs in US dollars remained
unchanged. The loan was closed just a year later than foreseen at appraisal,
to provide sufficient time for the return of retention money on civil works
contracts for the project.
3.       Overall, SONEDE's financial performance was satisfactory, though, its
finances at times were stretched due to a relatively large increase in
investments and a shortfall in net operating income; SONEDE financed with its
own funds the program of connection lines, which originally was to be financed
from medium-term loans from commercial banks in London. The planned tariff
increases were implemented and actual revenues were not far off the projected
ones. Actual operating expenses, however, exceeded the appraisal forecasts
due to large general salary adjustments that were not foreseen at appraisal.
In spite of that, SONEDE carried out the program within the time specified and
its financial position was never significantly affected by the reduced
earnings. The internal rate of return on the project was calculated to be
about 8 percent as estimated during the appraisal.
4.       An institutional objective was to provide SONEDE with appraisal
capabilities which were achieved under the project. As a result, the project
was followed by two more sector operations (Loans 2134-TUN and 2368-TUN),
which aimed at expanding further water supply services in rural areas.



REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
LOAN 1702-TUI - FIFTH WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
L INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Tunisian Government has always given high priority to public
water supply. Until 1968, responsibility for urban water supply was with the
"Regie des Eaux" (RDE), a service of the Ministry of Agriculture, which did
not have adequate financial resources and independence, nor sufficient
qualified staff to permit satisfactory planning and management of the systems
for rapid progress in the sector. In 1968, about 90 percent of the urban
population had access to a public water supply, of which almost half had house
connections. The percentage of population served in rural areas was much
lower, about a third of this population. The Government's objectives at that
time were to connect a larger segment of the urban population to the water
networks in order to increase water sales and thus available financing for
further expansion of the water systems.
1.02     fo reach these objectives and as part of the conditions for Loan
581-TUN, the Bank's first operation in the sector, the Government in July 1968
established the "Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux"
(SONEDE), as the national water authority responsible for Lhe provision of
potable water in urban areas and large villages. So far, SONEDE's
achievements in the sector have been remarkable. The percentage of urban
population connected to the network has increased from 43 percent in 1968 to
82 percent in 1984 and the number of house connections has more than
quintupled during the same period. Much progress has also been accomplished
in the rural areas, and SONEDE with the Bank's financial assistance, has
installed public water systems in most villages with an agglomerated
population of more than 3,000. At the same time, SONEDE has expanded its
technical capability and strengthened its financial position. It is expected
that SONEDE will have financed over 40 percent of its 1985 investments with
internally generated funds includir.g customer contributions.
1.03     The Bank provided continuous support and assistance during the period
of SONEDE's development, as indicated by a series of loans and credits from
1969 through 1984. In January 1969, the Bank made Loan 581-TUN of US$15.0
million for water supply works in the regions of Tunis and Sousse. These
works were jointly financed by the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) with a loan of US$5.0 million.  A year later, the Association approved
a credit of US$10.5 million for water supply works in eight areas of the
country. This project was also jointly financed by SIDA in an amount of
US$3.5 million. In May 1974, the Bank made Loan 989-TUN of US$23.0 million
for water supply systems in Sfax, Tunisia's second largest city, and in a
number of rural centers. In June 1977, the Bank approved Loan 1445-TUN of
US$21.0 million for the expansion of water supply works in the northern part



-2-
of the country, including Greater Tunis. The distribution works in Tunis were
co-financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development in an amount of
US$23.4 million.
1.04     In addition, the Bank Group assisted in the financing of a tourism
infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-Tun, February 1972), which
included US$8.2 million for water supply works. More recently, the Bank made
Loain 1431-TUN of US$42 million for the regulation and conveyance of the
Medjerdah River waters (Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project). Water supply works
for US$4.2 million were included in this project. SONEDE was the executing
agent of the water works included in the tourism and the Sidi Salem projects.
1.05     The first three projects (Loan 581-TUN, Credit 209-TUN and Loan
989-TUN) have been completed and audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED). The conclusion of the OED's audit reports was that the
objectives of the three projects were met and that SONEDE had developed into
an efficient and well-managed institution. Subsequently, the OED carried out
an overall evaluation of the Bank's water supply operations in Tunisia and
concluded that more financial assistance should be directed at the rural
areas. The Fifth Water Supply Project (Loan 1702-TUN, US$25.0 million,
May 31, 1979), for which this completion report has been prepared, was aimed
at establishing an appropriate framework fo.- SONEDE's increased involvement in
rural areas. The Fourth Project (Loan 1445-TUN) was completed at the end of
1984 and a completion report will soon be prepared for it.
H. PROJECT PREPARA1JON AND API AALSAL
Oriin, Preparation and Apprai
2.01     Prior to Loan 1702-TUN, the Bank financed large regional urban
projects which were appraised by Bank Staff. The number of individual
projectsin rural areas, however, was high and their selection and appraisal by
the Bank would have required long processing time and consequently would have
resulted in slow progress in the rural sector. Following the execution of the
first four Bank-financed projects, SONEDE's technical capability had been
greatly strengthened and it became evident that project selection &nd
appraisal could be delegated to SONEDE, on the basis of agreed procedures that
SONEDE would follow for the projects to be financed under a Bank loan.
2.02     As part of the project preparation, SONEDE determined the average per
capita cost of water works in medium-size cities and rural agglomerated
villages, taking into account both capital and operating costs discounted at
10 percent. The average per capita cost is a function of the population
connected to the network, and is conversely proportional to the size of the
population. It was agreed that SONEDE would use the average per capita cost
as the main criterion for selecting projects to be financed under the Bank
loan. It was further agreed that in order to provide SONEDE with some
flexibility in project selection, any project with a per capita cost not
exceeding the average cost by two standard deviations, would be eligible for
financing under the Bank loan. Agreement was also reached with SONEDE on the
,coutent and format of appraisal reports that SONEDE would submit to the Bank
for each project.



2.03     The project preparation started in October 1977 and during that
period, the Bank concentrated on strengthening the appraisal capability of
SONEDE. Feasibility studies and appraisal of a variety of projects were
carried out by SONEDE staff and reviewed by the Bank. The project was
appraised in October 1978. The appraisal mission evaluated in particular
SONEDE's management and fir.ancial performance.
Proiect's Role in Development Plan
2.04     The Tunisian Fifth Development Plan (1977-1981) included investments
of US$464 million in water supply works. The objective of these investments
was to increase the percentage of urban population connected to the network to
77 percent and to provide some 50 villages with pub.ic water supply. In
particular, from mid-1979 through 1981, SONEDE was planning to invest US$72
million in restructuring the distribution networks in medium-size cities,
constructing new systems in villages and expanding the distribution networks
into low-income areas to increase the number of house connections. The Fifth
Water supply Project was conceived to cover this part of the Fifth Investment
Plan.
Project Description
2.05     The project consisted of a number of subpr.'acts to provide water
supply services in rural agglomerated villages, expand and improve primary
distrbution systems in the country's intermediate cities, and expand the
distribution networks into low-income areas of the cities. In addition, the
project included a review of the service level objectives and financial
policies in the water supply sector and the formulation of priority projects
for the sector development. The selection and appraisal of subprojects was to
be carried out by SONEDE. The project was progrLJmed to be completed by the
end of 1981, with the loan closing a year later.
Negotiation and Approval
2.06     SONEDE was invited in April 1979 to negotiate a loan of US$25 million
for the project. The foreign exchange balance of US$7.7 million was to be
financea by commercial credits which were to be used to refinance credits
accorded by SONEDE to new customers to finance hookup charges to the network.
The local costs were to be fiiLanced by SONEDE.  Negotiations were held in
Washington, DC from April 9-12, 1979. The loan was approved on May 22, 1979
and became effective on October 19, 1979. There was no special condition of
effectiveness.
Loan Covenants
2.07     The Loan Ag- .ement with SONEDE contained the following main covenants:
(i)    The Borrower had to carry out a sector review in accordance with
terms of reference and a timetable acceptable to the Bank, and,
at the completion of the study, had to review the conclusions of
the study with the Government and the Bank and implement the
agreed recommendations (Section 3.02);



(ii)    SONEDE had to submit to the Bank reports, plans and tender
documents related to the subprojects (Section 3.04);
(iii)    The Borrower had to maintain records adequate to reflect, in
accordance with consistently accepted accounting practices, its
operations and financial conditions (section 5.01);
(iv)    Annual audits of SONEDE's accounts and financial statements had
to be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank, and the auditors' reports submitted to the Bank within six
months after the end of a fiscal year (Section 5.02);
(v)    SONEDE was committed not. to incur any long-term debt without the
Bank's concurrence, unless SONEDE's net annual revenues, before
depreciation and interest, were at least 1.5 times the projected
annual debt service on the proposed and existing debts (Section
5.04);
(vi)    The annual return on SONEDE's revalued net fixed assets in
operation, less customers'contributions and assets in
agglomerated rural centers, was to be not less than 7.5 percent
(Section 5.05);
2.08     In May 1982, as part of the Sixth Water Supply Project (Loan
2134-TUN), the rate of return covenant was changed to a cash contribution to
capital investments. Under Loan 2134-TUN, SONEDE was: (a) committed to
contribute with internally generated funds not including customers'
contributions, at least 20 percent of its capital investments in 1982 and
subsequent years; (b) committed to contribute with internally generated funds
including customers' contributions at least 40 percent of its capital
investments; and (c) no longer committed to revalue its fixed assets.
HII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. COST AND OPERATION
Project Emecution
3.01     The loan agreement provided that the project execution would be
completed by the end of 1981, in accord with the implementation period of the
Fifth Investment Plan. The original closing date of the loan was
December 31, 1982. The project actually was completed at the end of 1982 and
the loan closed on December 31, 1983. Under the project, primary systems in
eight cities were restructured and expanded. At the same time, water supply
networks were installed in twenty-seven rural villages. A list of these
cities and villages with their characteristics and the costs of the works is
given in Annex 1. As part of the project, SONEDE installed 165,400 house
connections i.e. 11,400 more than forecast at appraisal.
3.02     Because of delays in obtaining data from other governmental agencies,
SONEDE did not meet the appraisal deadline (December 31, 1979) for preparation
of a timetable for execution of the sector review. The timetable was
established at the end of 1980 and after that, the review was carried out



diligently. Its recommendations were followed in the preparation of the Sixth
Water Supply Project for which Loan 2134-TUN of US$30.5 million was made in
May 1982.
Procuemelt
3.03     Pipes and equipment for the project were procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for
procurement and the provisions set forth in Schedule 4 to the loan agreement.
Part of this supply was won by foreign manufacturers for an amount of
US$4.6 million. The remainder was attributed to local suppliers in an amount
of US$16.8 million equivalent. Civil works covered small subprojects in the
interior, which were not attractive to foreign contractors. Local competitive
bidding procedures were followed for these works and all of them were won by
local contractors, as foreseen at appraisal. SONEDE had no difficulty to
comply with the Bank guidelines and procurement was carried out in a
satisfactory manner. Overall, the performance of contractors on the project
was excellent.
nrojet Costs
3.04     Actual and estimated project costs are compared below:
Local    Foreign    Total      Local    Foreign    Total
0*,.  D Million ........... ....... ...US$ Million..0*
Appraisal Estimate    15.52      12.92     28.44      39.30     32.71      72.01
Actual Costs           24.98     13.43     38.41      46.50     25.00      71.50

Increase (Decrease) 2 61.0        3.9      35.1       18.3     (23.6)      (0.7)
The total project cost in US dollars practically remained unchanged,
while in Tunisian dinars it increased by 35.1 percent. The increase resulted
from the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Tunisian dinar during the
project execution period. The exchange rate, which was US$1 for D 0.395 at
appraisal and which was assumed to remain constant during the project
implementation, fluctuated to an average of US$1 for D 0.537. The decrease in
the foreign component is due to the fact that SONEDE used its own funds
(instead of medium-term loans from cormercial banks in London) to finance
credits to new customers.
3.05     At appraisal, it was expected that 33 percent of the investments
would be made in cities and 67 percent in rural villages. This proportion
practically remained unchanged (32:68). More detailed costs are shown in
Annex 2.
Disbursement
3.06     Based on categories of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement, the loan
proceeds were disbursed as follows:

The loan was disbursed within the proportions foreseen during the
appraisal. The closing date was extended a year to allow more time for payment
of retention money on the contracts. At the time of the original closing
date, US$21.8 million or 87.3 percent of the loan was disbursed. A comparison
between the actual and forecast schedules of disbursement is shown in Annex 3.
Operations
3.07     Actual and forecast water production and sales during the project
execution period are compared in Annex 4. The overall conclusion is that the
appraisal forecasts were remarkably accurate. Annual water sales were
projected to reach 161.2 Mm3 in 1984; in that year, SONEDE sold 165.7 Mm3,
2.8 percent greater than projected. Water production in 1984 amounted to
235.7 Mm3 or 15.1 percent higher than the appraisal estimate of
204.8 Mm3. This deviation resulted from the percentage of unaccounted-for
water which was slightly higher than the projected one (29.7 vs 27.0). The
population estimate, on the basis of which the number of house connections was
projected, was particularly accurate. The appraisal projected an urban
population of 3,605,000; the actual population was recorded to be 3,681,000.
As a result, the actual number of house connections in 1984 slightly exceeded
the appraisal projection (594,000 vs 589,000).
Iv. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Finncial Results
4.01     SONEDE's actual and estimated (appraisal) income statements, balance
sheets and cash flows for the years 1979 through 1984 are shown in Annexes 5
through 7. The company's financial performance during execution of the
project developed along lines as projected at appraisal, with two major
exceptions. First, under the Fifth Development Plan, more investment was made
than had been projected at appraisal. During the period 1981-84, SONEDE
invested D220 million instead of D205 million projected in the Development
Plan, a 7.3 percent increase; and as earnings decreased and long-term
borrowings remained unchanged, SONEDE had to rely on short-term loans to
finance the additional investment. Second, actual operating expenses exceeded
the appraisal forecast more than doubling the projections in 1983 and 1984.
4.02     A comparison of selected financial results in 1982 with the appraisal
projections is shown below:



-7-
Actual   Appraisal  Increase(Decrease)
.*e.D  million....        Percent
Operating Revenue                           38.30     40.02            (4.3)
Cash Operating Expenses                     21.46     12.07            77.8
Operating Income (Before Depreciation)    16.84       27.95           (60.3)
Total Debt Service                           9.70      9.62             0.8
Increase (Decrease) in Working Capital    (8.54)       2.22          (484.7)
Capital Investment                          63.98     58.45            12.9
Total Borrowing                             29.37     24.13            21.7
Government and Customer Contributions       20.93     18.21            14.9
A major departure from the appraisal projections was the greater than
anticipated operating expense, which resulted in a major decrease in working
capital. Part of the higher expense stemmed from large salary increases that
the Government approved diring the project execution, which were not foreseen
at appraisal.
4.03     During execution of the project, SONEDE's current ratio decreased
from 0.72 in 1979 to 0.40 in 1982, reflecting the decreasing working capital
as accounts payable for investments increased while SONEDE continued to
execute ongoing construction. In the ensuing years, the current ratio
improved reaching 0.67 in 1984. Although debt service coverage was well above
1.7 in most years, accounts receivable increased from 8 months of billings in
1979 to one year by 1981. Receivables dropped to about 10 months of billings
by 1984, but debt service coverage fell to about 1.45 with rapid increases
occurring in principal payments as grace periods ended on earlier borrowings.
Financial Covenants
4.04     Under Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement, SONEDE was committed to
earn a return of not less than 7.5 percent on its revalued net fixed assets in
operation less customers'contributions and assets in agglomerated rural
centers. Because the system of accounts in Tunisia is based on historical
costs, and because of the difficulty in excluding assets of rural centers,
SONEDE did not revalue its assets, and the Bank agreed in 1982, on the
occasion of negotiating its loan for the Sixth Water Supply Project (Loan
2134-TUN), to change the earnings covenant to a cash generation/contribution
to investment covenant to be applied from 1982 onwards.
4.05     SONEDE's return on non-revalued net fixed assets was 13 percent in
1979, 9 percent in 1980 and 5 percent in 1981, levels which, of course, were
not satisfactory although doing no apparent harm to the company's operations.
Its contributions to its capital investments were 11 percent in 1982,
18 percent in 1983 and 15 percent in 1984.
4.06     In addition, SONEDE was committed not to incur any new long-term debt
without the Bank's concurrence, if its projected net annual income before
depreciation and interest should fall below 1.5 times the projected annual
debt service. Debt service coverage during the execution of the Project was
never below 1.7, but, as mentioned above, it dropped to 1.45 in 1984.



-8-
Financig Plan
4.07     A comparison of the actual financing during the period 1979-1982 with
the financing plan at appraisal is shown in Annex 8. Overall, the total
requirements remained almost as forecast; however, SONEDE's working capital
decreased substantially during the period considered, instead of a small
increase as projected at appraisal. This decrease was necessary to compensate
for the shortfall in earnings, the level of borrowing being virtually the same
as had been projected. In effect, net internal cash generation decreased from
D56 million projected at appraisal to D29 million, accounting for only
15 percent of the financing sources instead of 28 percent projected at
appraisal. Meanwhile, actual customers'contributions more than doubled the
projections, and Government contributions were one fourth less.
Audit
4.08     Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement required that SONEDE's accounts
and financial statements be verified by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. The audits were performed by a qualified private Tunisian firm and
accepted by the Bank. The audit reports were submitted to the Bank with some
delays resulting from the time and action required by SONEDE to review and
approve the reports. As a result, under the Seventh Water Supply Project
(Loan 2368-TUN of February 1984), the submission time was modified to nine
months.
V. IS UTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organiation
5.01     A major objective of the project was to provide SONEDE with the
capability to select and appraise projects. The Loan Agreement contained a
set of criteria and procedures that SONEDE had to follow in selecting and
proposing projects for Bank financing. The application of these criteria was
to lead to the selection of the most economical projects. SONEDE fully met
this objective and experienced no difficulty in presenting projects which were
all approved by the Bank. The experience that SONEDE has acquired in
executing the project, has been extended to other investment programs which
are now thoroughly evaluated prior to their consideration for financing.
Following the project implementation, SONEDE has been given appraisal
responsibilities under the two subsequent Bank-financed projects (Loans
2134-TUN and 2368-TUN) which are currently under execution.
Growth
5.02     SONEDE's activities have grown considerably as a result of the
project implementation. Between 1978 and 1982, the company's net fixed assets
more than doubled and the number of customers increased by almost 50 percent.
The appraisal projected 505,700 customers at the end of 1982; the actual
number was 514,600, an increase of about 2 percent. The number of employees
increased from 3,145 at the beginning of 1979 to 4,100 at the end of 1982. At
the same time, however, staff efficiency increased. While in 1978, there were



- 9 -
9.2 staff per 1,000 customers, in 1982 there were only 7.5. Staff salaries
and fringe benefits are very competitive and SONEDE had no difficulty in
recruiting qualified staff. There was practically no high level staff
turnover during the project execution. Staff training needs were met with the
assistance of the "Office de l'Emplcl et de la Formation professionnelle", a
Government-operated agency.
Sectoral Development
5.03     The project contained a study of SONEDE's financial policies and
sector development objectives with a view to determining adequate means to
accelerate the installation of public water supply systems in rural areas.
The study was carried out by SONEDE staff and concluded that, in order to
improve services in the rural areas, SONEDE should progressively take over
operations in the rural centers and that investments in these centers should
be entirely financed by the Government; SONEDE should, however, meet or, rating
expenses and finance renewal and expansion works in the centers with its own
funds. These conclusions and recommendations were discussed with the Bank.
The Sixth and Seventh Water Supply Projects were formulated on the basis of
these recommendations.
VL PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
6.01     The project was primarily conceived to expand public water supply in
the medium-size cities and rural areas. The expansion of the distribution
networks in the cities was aimed at increasing the number of connection lines
avd consequently SONEDE's revenues. The program in the rural areas was the
first attempt to mobilize resources for the provision of potable water in the
smallest rural centers. All these objectives were achieved. Water supply
networks in eight cities were expanded and the program of house connections
was fully executed. As a result, the number of house connections increased
from 349,200 to 514,600 and water sales from 115.7 Mm3 in 1978 to
150.5 Mm3 in 1982. Water works were built in 27 villages to serve 98,000
people. The sector review was carried out and a new financial scheme adopted
for water works in rural areas.
Economic Justification
6.02     All the subprojects which were financed under the loan represented
the least-cost alternatives of water works for the communities. In addition,
the selected package of subprojects was the one with the greatest return for
SONEDE. In order to assess the economic value of the project, the internal
rate of return on the investments was re-calculated. On the basis of the
actual cobts and revenues throughout 1984 and projected ones through 2010, the
internal rate of return was calculated to be about 8 percent, equal to the
return estimated at appraisal.
Bank Performance
6.03     The First and Second Water Supply Projects were instrumental in



- 10 -
promoting good managerial and financial procedures in SONEDE. The Third and
Fourth Projects helped SONEDE in expanding water supply services in the
country and consolidating its financial basis. The Fifth Project allowed
SONEDE to develop its appraisal capabilities. SONEDE is now fully equipped to
screen well-designed projects and outline the conditions necessary for their
successful implementation.
6.04     The project implementation was supervised regularly.  Between Board
presentation in May 1979 and the project completion in December 1982, a total
of eight supervision missions visited Tunisia. It should be noted that these
missions supervised at the same time the Third and Fourth Projects. The
missions'advice and follow-up letters were instrumental in improving SONEDE's
operations and management. SONEDE is pleased with the project results and the
Bank's performance during the project execution.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     The project was the first sector lending operation for water supply
in Tunisia and was successfully implemented. The project objectives were
achieved beyond the appraisal expectations. A major expansirn of the public
water supply network was accomplished, allowing the percentage of population
connected to the network to raise from 70 percent to 77 percent. The number
of connection lines increased by almost 50 percent. In addition, the project
provided an opportunity for SONEDE to establish a long-term program for the
provision of potable water in rural areas.
7.02     Project selection and design and construction supervision were
carried out efficiently by SONEDE's staff. The project was completed with a
small delay due to the time needed to return retention money on the civil
works contracts. The quality of project construction was good.
7.03     A major institutional objective was to strengthen SONEDE's appraisal
capability. This was attained as reflected in the formulation of the two
subsequent Bank-financed sector operations (Loans 2134-TUN and 2368-TUN),
which aim at further expansion of public water distribution in rural areas.
