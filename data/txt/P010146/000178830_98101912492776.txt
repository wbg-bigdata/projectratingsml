SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD)
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01      Sri Lanka's annual consumption of commercial energy per head is low;
in 1976 it was reported as 106 kg standard coal equivalent 1/, compared with
2,069 kg per head in the world, 426 in all developing countries, 218 in India,
181 in Pakistan, 49 in Burma and 33 in Bangladesh. The range was from 11 in
Nepal to 25,236 in Qatar. 2/ By 1979 Sri Lanka's consumption had risen to
about 123 kg per head. The people also consume relatively large amounts of
traditional fuel, mainly firewood; estimates of annual consumption vary from
180 to 320 kg of fuel wood per head. It has been estimated 3/ that in 1975,
62.2% of energy consumed was supplied by firewood, with 26.3% coming from coal
and oil, and 11.5% from electricity.
1.02      There are no known reserves of coal, oil or natural gas in the
country. There is some peat but deposits are said to be small, scattered and
difficult to drain.
Hydro Power
1.03      Sri Lanka has an area of 25,332 square miles.  Most of its precip-
itation comes from the Southwest monsoon from March to September and from the
Northeast monsoon for the rest of the year. Annual average rainfall varies
from less than 40 inches in some northern parts of the island to more than 200
inches in places on the southwest slopes of the hills.
1.04      Sri Lanka's hydropower potential totals about 6,400 GWh per annum,
or 1,460 MW at 50% load factor, mainly in three basins centered on the central
highlands. They are the Mahaweli Basin in central Sri Lanka, the Walawe Basin
to the south, and the Kehelgamu-Maskeliya to the southwest. Some hydro power
has already been developed in each of these basins.
1.05      Present installed hydro generating capacity totals 328 MW out of a
total installed capacity of 398 MW. Seven more stations are planned to bring
1/   1 kg standard coal equivalent = 7,000 kilocalories.
2/   'World Energy Supplies 1972-76.'  U.N., New York 1978.
3/   'Towards an Energy Policy in Sri Lanka.'  T.L. Sankar, April 1978.



the total installed to about 1,090 MW. The present yield of firm energy is
about 1,500 GWh per year; projected additions will increase this to about 3,740
GWh by 1991. GSL's plans envisage that by 1991 all hydro sites with potential
exceeding 15 to 20 MW will have been developed. There may well be smaller
sites that are economic; further surveys are needed to determine this. 1/
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has agreed to update information on potential
hydro sites to enable consultants to be appointed for detailed hydro-feasibility
studies.
Traditional Fuels
1.06      Wood is the most widely used fuel; statistics on the subject are
scarcze but it appears that annual consumption may be between 4 and 5 million
tons. There is concern that the use of wood as fuel at this rate of con-
sumption is leading to deforestation. The cutting of trees for use as lumber
may also be contributing significantly to this problem.
Petroleum
1.07      Exploration is taking place and it is expected that drilling both
onshore and offshore will be started in 1980. Sri Lanka was recently classified
as having favourable geological prospects for potential oil or gas discoveries
whichl gives some cause for hope. 2/
1.08      Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), a statutory corporation, is the
sole importer and refiner; its refinery near Colombo has a capacity of 2.35 M
tonnes per year (40,000 bbls per day). The refinery does not produce enough
kerosene or diesel fuel to satisfy local demand and the deficits are imported.
These fuels are sold on the local market at prices lower than either the cost
of importing them or of producing them locally. Furnace oil, a blend of
residual and distillate used in CEB's steam power station, is produced by CPC
in greater quantity than the local market can absorb; the surplus is exported
at a higher price than local users pay. Gasoline is sold at a high price to
offset the cost of subsidizing kerosene and diesel. 3/
1.09      Data from CPC indicate that refined imports have been rising rapidly
in riecent years to meet increasing demand for kerosene and auto diesel fuel:
table 1.1 indicates that whilst net consumption rose by 32% in 6 years, the
market value of that consumption rose by 667%.
1/   The last report on this subject was the updating in 1967/69 by UNDP/FAO
of Pfeiffer's 1958 report.
2/   World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 289, April 1978.
3/   Prices in effect on January 27, 1980 were:
Kerosene                    13.68 Rs/IG
Auto diesel                 13.50 Rs/IG
Furnace Oil                 12.40 Rs/IG
Gasoline                    37.50 Rs/IG

B. The Power Subsector
Sector Organization
1.10      Sri Lanka's first public electricity supply was made available in
Colombo in 1895 by Messrs. Boustead Bros. The business was soon taken over by
United Planters Co., who extended it and in 1899 built the Colombo electric
tramways. In 1902, the Colombo Electric Tramways and Lighting Co. Ltd. was
formed and provided electricity supply until 1927 when the Department of Gov-
ernment Electrical Undertakings (DGEU) was established to control the utility
which had by then been purchased by the Government. DGEU was succeeded in
1969 when the CEB, a statutory corporation, was established with responsi-
bility for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in
the country. CEB supplies power direct to consumers and at present also sells
in bulk to 214 local authorities who retail to their own consumers. It is
expected that in 1980 CEB will take over the distribution systems at present
owned by local authorities and sell direct to all consumers. The recently
formed Ministry of Power and Energy is responsible for supervision of CEB's
policies.
1.11      CEB has in the past been responsible for the development of generating
capacity and is presently engaged in building Bowatenne (40 MW) and Canyon (30
MW) hydro stations. For the next several years hydro generating capacity will
be developed by the Mahaweli Development Authority (MDA), an agency established
under the Ministry of Irrigation and Mahaweli Development having responsibility
for the implementation of the accelerated Mahaweli multi-purpose development
program.  As they are completed, the Mahaweli hydro-generating facilities will
be transferred to CEB for operation. During the next ten years some 540 MW of
additional hydro capacity will be developed in this way at Victoria, Kotmale,
Randenigala and Rantembe (Annex 1).
External Assistance
1.12      Sri Lanka has in the past obtained external financial assistance in
the form of loans or supplier credits towards the foreign exchange costs of its



- 4 -
power sector development program. The Bank made four loans totalling US$58.4
million between 1954 and 1969 for the development of hydro and steam generating
capacity as follows:
(a) Loan 101-CE (US$15.9 million) to GSL in 1954 to help finance
the 25 MW expansion of the Laksapana hydroelectric scheme;
(b)  Loan 209-CE (US$7.4 million) to GSL in 1958 to help finance
construction of a 25 MW thermal plant at Kelanitissa, Colombo;
(c) Loan 283-CE (US$14.1 million) to GSL in 1961 to help finance a
25 MW expansion at Kelanitissa; and
(d) Loan 636-CE (US$21.0 million) to CEB 1/ in 1969 to help finance
the 90 MW Maskeliya Oya Stage II project, a 25 MW gas turbine
and management consultancy and engineering services. US$4.5
million of this loan was cancelled when the gas turbine was
not purchased.
Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE (US$29.0 million) to GSL was approved in 1969 for
the multi-purpose Mahaweli Ganga Development project of which the 50 MW
Ukuwela (Pologolla) power station forms a part and is now operated by CEB.
Further, in 1973, a US$6 million IDA credit (372-CE) was approved for the
development of CEB's transmission and distribution systems. All works were
completed satisfactorily although managerial (paras 2.08 and 2.09) and
financial (para 4.02) improvements have been less than expected since CEB was
established. A further strengthening of CEB is an important feature of the
proposed project. Project completion reports in respect of Loan 636-CE and
Credit 372-CE to CEB are under preparation.
1.13      More recently, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided finance
for construction of the Bowatenne and Canyon hydro stations, for completion in
1980 and 1981 respectively, and for rural electrification. The planned con-
struction of hydro generating facilities at Samanalawewa with aid from the USSR
has now been postponed until the late 1980's. GSL is arranging bilateral
financing of the construction of hydro generation components of the Mahaweli
program as follows: - Sweden (Kotmale), U.K. (Victoria) and West Germany
(Randenigala/Rantembe). In addition to the proposed project GSL has requested
IDA assistance in the financing of CEB's further program of thermal generating
capacity (para 1.16) and transmission works (para 3.07).
Existing Facilities
1.14      CEB's existing generating, transmission and distribution facilities
are described in Annexes 2 and 3 and illustrated on map 10199Rl. CEB's present
insitalled capacity is 390 MW, all interconnected on one system. In addition
there are many privately owned generating stations, most of them less than 500
kVA but ranging as large as 5.75 MW in CPC's refinery at Sapugaskanda. The
transmission and distribution system comprises 549 miles of 132 kV line with 17
substations, 214 miles of 66 kV lines with 9 substations, about 3,000 miles of
1/   CEB was established in June 1969.



-5
33 kV, and about 750 miles of 11 kV lines. The system control and load dis-
patching centre is at Kolonnawa, and all important plants and switching centers
can communicate by means of power line carrier. Trouble crew vehicles have
radio communication.
Access to Service and Status of Supply
1.15      The total energy generated by CEB's power stations in 1979 was 1,540
GWh, about 97% of it by hydro. CEB supplied about 155,000 consumers, including
214 local authorities who distributed electricity to another 205,000 consumers,
making the total number of consumers about 360,000. Of these, about 263,000
were domestic. Allowing an average of 6.5 persons to a family unit, this
suggests that at present only about one household in eight has electricity
connnected. Rural electrification has been extended to about 2,000 of a total
25,000 villages (para. 1.19). Electricity consumption per head was less than
90 kWh in 1979. The great majority of households use firewood for cooking and
kerosene for lighting.
1.16      The Bowatenne station is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of
1980, Canyon by the end of 1981, and Victoria and Kotmale in 1984/85. These
new hydro stations will not be on line in time to prevent shortages of energy
from 1980 through 1985. To prevent energy shortages in the years 1980-85 CEB
is purchasing three gas turbines of 20 MW each which should be installed in
1980. Similarly, the system will not have firm generating capacity to meet
peak power demand from 1980 unless these gas turbines are installed. Fore-
casts indicate that another block of thermal generation will be needed after
these gas turbines and before the next major hydro station; CEB has con-
sultants working on a long range study to determine the means of meeting this
demand at least cost.
1.17      The quality of service to most of CEB's consumers is acceptable;
there are exceptions to this but most will be taken care of under the proposed
project.  The maintenance of CEB's transmission and distribution system has
been adequate although unsystematic. Less satisfactory are the distribution
lines of some of the local authorities, where for many years only the barest
maintenance has been done and consumers have been constantly connected to
existing lines so that voltages at peak times are well below acceptable levels.
CEB will have to carry out a heavy and costly program of upgrading when it
takes over the local authority systems, for which CEB has requested GSL finan-
cial assistance. The largest of the local authority undertakings, Mt. Lavinia,
r          with about 14,000 consumers and serving a population of about 250,000 people,
was taken over by CEB in 1979. Some of the local authorities serve as few as
100 consumers.
1.18      Maintenance of CEB's generating stations has been done reasonably
well in the past but there are signs of recent deterioration. Adequate systems
exist for keeping plant history and maintenance records but in many stations
these are not being kept up to date. There is no planned maintenance schedule
for each station to permit management to check easily that all items of plant
are provided for and have duly been serviced. These deficiencies are par-
ticularly evident at the Kelanitissa steam plant.



-6-
Rural Electrification
1.19      The first rural electrification schemes were undertaken in the early
1960s. Sri Lanka has about 25,000 villages and CEB had provided service to
about 2,000 by the end of 1979. Some of the local authorities who buy in bulk
from CEB have extended their lines into nearby villages, adding to the extent
of rural electrification. By 1983, an additional 1,150 villages will be con-
nected under the current Rural Electrification project financed by ADB.  Simul-
taneously, more rural electrification will be done under GSL's decentralized
budget. Under this scheme an MP may transfer funds out of his constituency's
development budget to CEB, who will then electrify areas chosen by the MP.
About 50 schemes a year, each covering one or two villages, are expected to
be implemented in this way at a cost of about Rs 50 million per year.
1.20      Until now, rural electrification schemes have been selected rather at
random. The qualifying requirement has been a gross revenue equal to at least
12% of the investment. The results so far have been disappointing; forecasts
of demand have been over optimistic and actual revenues have averaged only 8%
of investment. The response has been to relax the financial criterion; only
5% return is now required or, alternatively, 12% on an investment in low
voltage plant only.
1.21      The ADB project will have significant effects:-
(a)  the rural electrification force in CEB is to be expanded and
empowered to scrutinize and monitor the formulation and
implementation of new schemes, as well as to implement the
ADB Project. CEB has agreed to appoint a Project Manager
for rural electrification and a Load Promotion and Monitor-
ing Unit;
(b)  economic analysis and discounted cash flow calculations are
to be introduced into the feasibility analysis of rural schemes;
(c)  CEB will arrange installment financing of house wiring and con-
nection charges.
System Losses
1.22      On an extensive but lightly loaded system such as CEB's a differ-
ence of 15% between energy generated and energy sold is reasonable. Up to
1976 losses were recorded as less than 12%, but in 1977 they started to in-
crease and are now about 16%. Since, in future, sizeable blocks of energy
will have to be generated thermally, it is essential to identify the reasons
for the increase in losses and to curb the trend. As part of the proposals to
improve management (para 2.09), CEB will investigate systems losses and under-
take a study of load management and conservation.
Historical Consumption
1.23      Growth in consumption of electrical energy in the long run 1961 to
1978 has averaged 9.3% p.a., ranging from 17.8% in 1966 to 3.3% in 1974. From



- 7 -
1972 to 1977 there was a period of weaker growth, but it appears that a rate
higher than the long term trend is now being established.
1.24      The short and long term annual growth rates for each class of con-
sumer are summarized in table 1.2. Energy sales since 1961 are analyzed in
table 1.3.

Load Forecast
1.25      CEB prepares an annual short term (5 or 6 years) energy sales forecast
from forecasts of the consumption of each class of consumer within each of
CEB's geographical Divisions. In so doing, historical trends are considered
for each of the 23 areas which together make up the Divisions. Due weight is
given to known prospective loads such as housing schemes, industrial parks,
commercial areas, individual industries and commercial properties, and rural
electrification schems.
1.26      For longer term forecasting, correlation and regression analyses are
used. All consumers are divided into three categories, and growth rates are
related to gross domestic product, to value-added in mining and manufacturing
and export processing, and to population. To accommodate deviations from the
trend, upper and lower limit estimates are made.



- 8 -
1.27      Load forecasts have been prepared recently by various authorities
studying the Mahaweli development program and the energy sector of Sri Lanka,
and these forecasts taken together endorse CEB's own sales forecast. There
does not, however, appear to be justification for CEB's assumption that losses
will rapidly fall back to 12.5% from the recent 16%. In view of the strength
of growth in the economy and in electricity sales since 1977, and the large
number of energy consuming developments projected in the next few years, pre-
dictions of growth rates higher than the long term average in the past seem
plausible although perhaps optimistic. Reports from recent economic studies
predict that the rate of inflation will become excessive unless GSL moderates
the pace of development in the country. Further, the price of electricity is
at present unduly low, on average about US$0.02 per kWh, and a more appropriate
pricing policy, when introduced, may reduce the growth in demand in some extent
(para. 5.03).
1.28      The best central estimate derived from work by CEB, NEDECO and the
appraisal mission is summarised in Table 1.4 and is shown in greater detail in
Annex 4.

II. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
2.01      GSL will be the recipient of the proposed credit (US$19.5 million
equivalent) and will onlend the proceeds (paragraph 4.24) to CEB, the imple-
menting agency for the project. A similar arrangement was made under the
earlier transmission annd distribution project (Credit 372-CE).
Organization
2.02      CEB was established by the CEB Act, No. 17 of 1969 (1969 CEB Act)
as the successor to the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings
(DGEU) and is responsible for the development and coordination of the genera-
tion, supply and distribution of electrical energy in Sri Lanka. While CEB is
a public corporation the 1969 CEB Act does not endow it with fully autonomous
powers and the government has reserved to itself a substantial role in impor-
tant policy matters and in particular tariffs, capital investment, borrowing



and the appointment of the Chairman and the General Manager. The conditions
of service of all CEB staff are subject to GSL regulation. CEB is also subject
to the provisions of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 (1971 Finance Act) which
regulates the finances of all public corporations in Sri Lanka.
2.03      CEB is a corporate body governed by a seven-member Board; members
serve a five-year term and may be reappointed. Board members are appointed by
GSL - four with experience in either engineering, commerce, administration or
accountancy, and the others representing local authorities, industry and the
Ministry of Finance - and may be removed at any time. The Chairman is appointed
from amongst the Board members; the present Chairman is also the Secretary,
Ministry of Power and Energy.
2.04      CEB's organization structure was designed by consultants, Urwick
International Ltd., in the early 1970s under Loan 636-CE. While some minor
modifications have been made in recent years the original pattern is basically
unchanged and meets CEB's present needs (Annex 5). Changes may be required
in future as a result of the extension of rural electrification schemes and
of the takeover of local authority distribution systems. An assurance has
been obtained that CEB will submit to IDA, in advance, any proposal for major
change to CEB's organizational structure.
Management and Staffing
2.05      While the Chairman is responsible through the Board for policy
matters and close liaison with government, the General Manager is CEB's Chief
Executive Officer. He is responsible for the overall direction and control of
CEB's day-to-day business. The present General Manager is an experienced and
long-serving engineer who is due to retire shortly. He is assisted by two
Additional General Managers, four Deputy General Managers and a Finance Manager.
With the exception of the Finance Manager, who is a qualified accountant, all
top management posts are filled by engineers. The Commercial and Personnel
Managers, Chief Internal Auditor and the Legal Officer all report directly to
the General Manager. CEB's senior management structure is set out in Annex 5.
Below this level, CEB operations are decentralized and are controlled at plant
(for generation) and divisional level. Each of the seven operating divisions
into which Sri Lanka is organized is headed by a Divisional Manager, who is a
qualified engineer; the divisions are further divided into areas which are the
primary units for systems maintenance, meter reading and consumer services.
2.06      CEB has experienced considerable difficulty in retaining trained
staff in recent years as many engineers and accountants have left for overseas
or private sector posts offering substantially higher monetary rewards. Salary
differentials for senior CEB staff do not adequately reflect the heavy addi-
tional responsibilities of such posts. The lack of experienced engineering
staff in the 30-45 age range is particularly noticeable at CEB while qualified
accountants are now extremely difficult to recruit. These problems appear to
be common to many public sector enterprises in Sri Lanka and, in an effort to
improve the attractiveness of the public sector, GSL recently made such salaries
tax-exempt.



- 10 -
2.07      CEB's present manpower is about 10,000, against an authorized total
of 11,098 in 1979. Manpower has increased as follows in recent years:
Table 2.1: CEB MANPOWER

and other support
staff                      1,895   1,934   2,379  2,476         3,412      2,787

skilled)                   6,050   6,308   6,712  6,918         7,329      6,849

While CEB's staff numbers are high in relation to the size of its operations
and the number of consumers it serves the increase in recent years has been
reasonable. A major part of the increase in CEB manpower has resulted from
an expanding works program, particularly the rural electrification program
undertaken by force account. Further manpower increases are expected follow-
ing the absorption of the local authority distribution systems and for the
operation and maintenance of planned generation, transmission and distribu-
tion facilities.
Management Systems
2.08      Comprehensive management information, accounting and budgeting
systems were introduced by CEB in 1973 following a study by consultants,
Urwick International Ltd., financed under Loan 636-CE. While the systems are
satisfactory and are relevant to CEB's operations, senior management is not
utilizing the information system, and this has resulted in a lack of control
of CEB's activities. Staffing difficulties in recent years have led to
serious delays in the preparation of periodic management reports, particularly
financial reports. Internal audit arrangements have never been satisfactorily
established in CEB although recently it was agreed with ADB that a Chief
Internal Auditor be appointed. The Chairman has agreed to consider making the
person appointed responsible to the Chairman to ensure greater independence of
action.



- 11 -
2.09      While some improvements are expected following the strengthening
of CEB's accounting staff during 1979 CEB's managerial shortcomings require
investigation and follow up action. The Chairman has suggested that Urwick
International Ltd. be retained (a) to review managerial performance and methods
in CEB and in particular reporting and control procedures, including internal
audit arrangements and (b) to recommend improvements and prepare necessary
management development and training programs (para 2.11). The cost of this
study and the implementation of a program of improvements to be agreed with
IDA, including the possible employment of management advisers, will be financed
under the proposed project. The appointment of management consultants is a
condition of credit effectiveness. Regular and improved reporting is expected
and details were agreed at negotiations (Annex 6).
Accounting and Budgeting
2.10      CEB's management was unable to offer full explanations for the sub-
stantial increases in operating costs in FYs 1979 and 1980 (paragraph 4.04).
Financial and associated records are in arrears and financial reporting is
infrequent. GSL agrees that the present lack of budgetary and cost controls
in CEB requires an urgent remedy. CEB has appointed local accountants (a)
to assist CEB staff in bringing records up-to-date, preparing timely FY1979
accounts for audit and preparing current financial control reports and (b)
to analyze and report on the reasons for increases in CEB operating costs in
FY1979. The provision of satisfactory accounts for FY1979 is a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Training
2.11      CEB operates a residential training center at Castlereagh for tech-
nicians which offers engineering courses related to CEB's operations. Accom-
modation is limited and CEB is planning to develop non-residential technical
training facilities in Colombo as a result of a recent investigation by the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Washington, D.C., financed
under the USAID program. Regular training programs are required to fit
engineers for managerial positions; at present six-months on-the-job training
is given to newly qualified engineers prior to assuming responsibility for
operating facilities but there is no program for progressive management dev-
elopment. Training programs are also required to familiarize accounting staff
with CEB's financial operations and reporting requirements for financial
control. The preparation of such programs has been discussed with CEB and
an assurance has been obtained that, following completion of the management
study (para 2.09), CEB will submit to IDA a satisfactory training program for
all cadres of CEB staff by June 30, 1981 and will thereafter implement the
agreed program.
Proposed Transfer of Local Authority Distribution Systems
2.12      While CEB supplies power directly to some 155,000 domestic, com-
mercial and industrial consumers throughout Sri Lanka, another 205,000 con-
sumers are supplied by local authorities which purchase power in bulk from
CEB. The quality of local authority service to consumers is unsatisfactory



- 12 -
and GSL has recently determined that CEB should assume responsibility for the
distribution facilities of the local authorities under powers contained in the
1969 CEB Act. CEB will take over all staff, assets and liabilities relating
to electricity supply and CEB has requested GSL to make available funds for the
rehabilitation of the distribution systems.
2.1:3     The transfer of responsibilities to CEB will impose a considerable
burden on CEB's present staff and may affect CEB's financial viability; local
authority billing and collection procedures, in particular, will require care-
ful review. GSL has been asked to consider a phased takeover consistent with
CEB's capabilities.  CEB is presently collecting detailed information from
each local authority and, when the results are known, will be in a position
to consider any necessary changes to its organization and managerial structure
and to assess the financial implications. CEB will associate the management
consultants (para 2.09) with this task and will keep IDA informed of progress
and submit, for IDA's agreement prior to the date of transfer, a program for
integrating the local authority systems. An assurance to this effect has been
obtained.
Audit
2.14      In accordance with previous arrangements under Credit 372-CE, CEB's
accounts are audited by the Auditor-General, who has attached a specific team
of officers to CEB. In the past, delays in submitting audited accounts to IDA
within the required six months of the year-end have occurred repeatedly. CEB's
FY1978 audited accounts were received some eight months late. The problem
arises in part from delays by CEB in submitting the accounts for audit and in
part from delays in releasing the Auditor-General's report. CEB is required,
under the 1971 Finance Act, to submit its accounts for audit within four months
of the year-end. The Auditor-General should report to Parliament within ten
months of the year-end. Following discussions with the Auditor-General,
improvements are expected from FY1979 onwards, particularly as greater prior-
ity will be given to World Bank audit requirements. However, it seems unlikely
that a target of six months will be achieved in the near future. It is pro-
posed, therefore, that CEB should in future submit unaudited accounts to IDA
within four months of the year-end (at the time of submitting them to the
Auditor-General) and the Auditor-General's report within ten months of the
year-end. An assurance to this effect has been obtained.
Insurance
2.15      CEB has for a number of years borne its own insurable risks and has
established an Insurance Reserve to which an annual contribution of 1/10% of
gross fixed assets values is transferred from retained earnings. This arrange-
ment is satisfactory.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The project is designed to enable CEB to augment its transmission
and distribution facilities between 1981 and 1984, in order to meet increasing



v il v
demands for electricity from all parts of the country and all sectors of the
economy and to strengthen CEB's management and commercial performance. It
will permit power and energy from power stations now under construction to
reach the consumers. It is intended to:-
(a)  increase the availability of power and reliability of high
voltage grid supplies transmitted to areas where load will
soon exceed present capacity.
(b)  transmit high voltage grid supplies to areas where none is
available at present.
(c)  extend and reinforce subtransmission lines so as to improve
the quality of present supplies and to provide electricity
in areas as yet unserved.
(d)  provide supplies for new housing estates, hotels and commercial
buildings soon to be erected in the course of the redevelopment
of the city of Colombo.
(e)  furnish distribution lines and substations necessary to permit
consumers to be connected to the system.
Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of the following components (for more
detail see Annex 7 and Map 10199R1):
(a)  172 miles of 132 kV second circuits to be strung on existing
towers to improve supplies to Ratmalana, Jaffna and Trincomalee.
(b)  50 miles of new single circuit 132 kV line to Valachchenai.
(c)  132 kV grid substation at Valachchenai.
(d)  Extensions to existing 132 kV switching stations at Kolonnawa,
Ratmalana and Anuradhapura.
(e)  500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission line.
(f)  Two new 132 kV primary distribution substations in Colombo with
their supply cables.
(g)  Augmentation of existing primary distribution substations in
Colombo.
(h)  Extensions and alterations to the 11 kV underground cable
network in Colombo fed by these substations.
(i)  125 miles of 33 kV overhead distribution line and 250
substations.
(j)  Construction and service vehicles.



- 14 -
(k) Operational buildings and staff quarters.
(1) Engineering and management consulting services, technical
assistance and training.
Project Cost
3.03      The estimated cost of the proposed project is Rupees 987.5 million
(US$63.3 million) including contingencies and customs duties. The estimated
costs are summarized in Table 3.1 and shown in greater detail in Annex 8.

3.04      The cost estimates were developed by CEB based on the costs of
recently undertaken comparable work or recent quotations and updated to end
1979 prices. Physical contingencies average 10% and range from 5% for supply
of certain substation equipment to 25% for trenching and cable jointing
according to the nature of the item. Price contingencies amounting to 19.9%
of the project cost were calculated using the following rates of escalation:-
1979   1980    1981   1982   1983   1984
Foreign     %           12    10.5       9       8      7       7
Local       %           18    21        15      12      9       9
Customs duties ranging from 5% to 50% on imported equipment and materials were
allowed as applicable, amounting to 15.6% of the total project cost. The cost
estimates are adequate.



Project Financing Plan
3.05      It is proposed that parallel financing of the project be arranged
between IDA (US$19.5 million) and the Saudi Fund (US$20 million). The combined
amount (US$39.5 million) would cover 100% of the foreign costs of the proposed
project and represents 62% of the total project cost (or 74% excluding customs
duties). CEB will be expected to meet all local costs from internal cash gene-
ration. The components to be financed by IDA, the Saudi Fund and CEB are iden-
tified in Table 3.2. 1/ A firm commitment for Saudi funding for the project
is a condition of credit effectiveness.

Engineering and Implementation
3.06      Most of the works in the proposed project are of kinds which already
exist on CEB's system and with which CEB's engineers have substantial previous
experience; they are thus able to produce their own designs, specifications
and tender documents, and to supervise the construction. The one area in which
1/   An alternative, which the Saudi Fund has suggested, provides for IDA to
finance all 33 kV subtransmission works and the Saudi Fund to finance
consultancies.



- 16 -
CEB does not have previous experience is the proposed indoor primary substa-
tions in Colombo. Foreign engineering consultants will be retained for the
design and supervision of that part of the project and their appointment is
a condition of credit effectiveness. Engineering costs are estimated at
US$0.4 million. The contract will provide for about 36 man months of for-
eign engineers' services at an estimated man month cost of US4'8,500 including
salaries, costs, fees, international travel and subsistence.
3.07      A future project, for which IDA assistance has been requested,
comprises the 220 kV and 132 kV lines, substations and switching stations re-
quired to transmit the output from the planned generating stations at Victoria,
Kotmale and Randenigala - Rantembe into the Colombo area. CEB's engineers
in 1979 performed studies which indicated that a voltage higher than 132 kV
would be economic for this phase of expansion, and their findings were con-
firmed by consultants, who recommended 220 kV for certain of the new lines.
Detailed engineering design for this work will be needed shortly and provision
has been made under this project for the appointment of foreign consultants
for design work and preparation of tender documents. Engineering costs are
estimated at US$1 million. The contract will provide for about 90 man months
of foreign engineers' services at an estimated man month cost of $8,500 inc-
luding salaries, costs, fees, international travel and subsistence.
3.08      The project will be completed in stages between late 1981 and March
1984 (Annex 9).
3.09      During the period of the project, CEB's construction forces will be
performing the following line work which will limit their availability for
the proposed project:
Ukuwela - Bowatenne line; 32 km of 132 kV single circuit to
be built in 1981.
Pannipitiya - Neboda line; 38 km of 132 kV double circuit,
to be built in 1982/83.
Canyon - Laxapana line; 10 km of 132 kV single circuit, to
be built in 1980/81.
Relocation of 5 km of 132 kV line for the Kotte Parliamentary
complex in 1980/81.
ADB Rural Electrification Project covering 1150 villages in
1981/83. Special Projects rural electrification - 300 km
per year.
Routine system augmentation - 400 km of line and 150 sub-
stations per year.
3.10      The 132 kV components of the project will be constructed under four
single responsibility contracts. These will cover the 132 kV transmission
lines, the grid substation and switching stations, the 132 kV primary distri-
bution substations, and the 132 kV underground cables. Single responsiblity
contracts are preferred because they place undivided responsibility for all the



- 17 -
work upon one contractor, thus avoiding disputes which otherwise arise between
the construction contractor and the owner or the suppliers of materials over
such difficulties as late deliveries and the repair or replacement of materials
found defective. The remaining construction work in the project will be
performed by CEB's own work force.
Procurement
3.11      International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guide-
lines will be employed in the award of all major components to be financed by
IDA, including both the contracts for the high voltage lines and substations
and the supply of foreign equipment and materials to be employed or erected by
CEB. Vehicles, equipment and materials not exceeding US$10,000 an item and
US$100,000 in aggregate may be procured in accordance with local procedures,
which are satisfactory. The foreign components to be financed by the Saudi
Fund will be procured and disbursed in accordance with Saudi Fund's require-
ments.
Disbursements
3.12      The credit will be disbursed against the following items:-
(a) 100% of the foreign expenditures of contracts for:
(i) 132 kV transmission lines
(ii) 132 kV substations and switching stations, including
the changes to the 132 kV switchgear at Kolonnawa
and Kelanitissa required for Colombo distribution.
(b) Equipment and materials for the 33 kV subtransmission lines
and vehicles and tools: 100% of the foreign expenditures
for directly imported items, or 100% of the local expendi-
tures (ex factory) for locally manufactured items or 65%
for locally procured items.
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures of consultancies, techni-
cal assistance and training. 1/
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 10. To cover payments
to engineering and management consultants it is recommended that retroactive
financing not exceeding US$350,000 be authorized for expenditures incurred
after May 1, 1980. 1/
Land Acquisition
3.13      Land is required for the grid substation at Valachchenai and the two
new primary distribution substations in Colombo. The land is owned by govern-
ment agencies and will be transferred to CEB when required.
1/   This item may be financed by the Saudi Fund in which case retroactive
financing would not be required.



- 18 -
Risks
3.14      The project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no
unusual risks and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
Price contingencies in the cost estimates have been allocated so as to mini-
mize the risk of cost overruns due to delays.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
CEB's Statutory Position
4.01      CEB's finances are regulated by the provisions of the 1969 CEB Act
and the 1971 Finance Act, which affects all public corporations in Sri Lanka.
CEB is required, by Section 38 of the 1969 CEB Act, to operate in a commer-
cial manner so as to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet all outgoings,
including depreciation and interest, and a reasonable proportion of development
costs. CEB's statutory obligations were amended in two important respects
following IDA approval of Credit 372-CE 1/ in 1973:
(a) CEB is permitted to charge depreciation in its accounts based
on a current valuation of fixed assets rather than the historic
cost of such assets.
(b) CEB's obligation to pay an 8% annual dividend on GSL's equity
capital is waived each year until CEB has generated a 30%
contribution to the combined annual capital expenditure on
electricity supply, including interest during construction,
of CEB and any other body responsible for undertaking a joint
scheme with CEB.
Past Financial Performance
4.02      CEB was required, under IDA Credit 372-CE, (Project Agreement Section
4.04(a)(ii)) to maintain tariffs at levels sufficient to produce, from FY1974,
at least an 8% annual rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets. In
this respect CEB's financial performance has been unsatisfactory mainly as a
result of unchanged tariff levels between April 1, 1972 and December 1, 1978.
The failure to increase tariffs reduced CEB's capacity to contribute to its
investment program in recent years, although the overall contribution from
FY1974 through 1978 was 33%. 2/ In the seven years FY's 1972 through 1978
whereas the average cost of energy (including depreciation) per kWh rose by
58% from Rs 0.11 to 0.17 CEB's average sales revenue per kWh rose by only 6%,
from Rs 0.15 to 0.16.
1/   These conditions have been repeated under the proposed Credit.
2/   After allowing for increased working capital requirements the amount
available was equivalent to 10% of capital investment between FY1974-78.

the estimated position in FY1979 are summarized in Table 4.1 below and are

/c   Following an initial valuation of CEB's fixed assets at January 1, 1972
subsequent revaluations of fixed assets, using local indices agreed with
IDA, were incorporated in CEB's accounts on January 1, 1977 and 1978.
A further revaluation to January 1, 1979 will be made in CEB's FY1979
accounts: it is estimated that this will increase the value of CEB's
fixed assets by 37-1/2%.
Present Financial Position
4.04       CEB's tariff increase from December 1, 1978 averaged about 80% and
increased sales revenue/kWh from Rs 0.16 in FY1978 to Rs 0.30 in FY1979. CEB's
tariff structure was also modified substantially and a fuel adjustment clause
was authorized. To date, however GSL has not permitted the full fuel adjust-
ment (paragraph 4.17). CEB confidently expected, in late 1978, to make at
least an 8% rate of return on net fixed assets in FY-1979 but operating cost
increases of about 80% in FY1979 and the higher than expected revaluation of
assets reduced the rate of return to about 4%. Cost increases resulted in
part from increased thermal generation, cyclone damage and pay and price
escalation but so far CEB has been unable to offer full explanations for all
the increases (paragraph 2.10).

/a   "Other" represents the transfer to CEB of the Ukuwela hydro-
station from the Mahaweli Development Board on terms yet to
be finalized.
While CEB's balance sheet appears satisfactory, with a current ratio 2.0
and a debt/equity ratio 19:81, several matters need to be resolved and appro-
priate adjustments made in CEB's future accounts (paragraphs 4.06 to 4.11):
(a) Fixed Asset Valuation
4.06      CEB's unaudited accounts for FY1979 will not be available before
mid-1980, but should incorporate a further revaluation of fixed assets as
at January 1, 1979 in accordance with the movement of certain GSL published
indices during 1978. This method of valuation was previously agreed with IDA
and will form the basis of future annual reviews of CEB's fixed asset values.
(b) Transfer of Assets from the Mahaweli Development Authority (MDA) 1/
4.07      The 1969 CEB Act authorized CEB to enter into "joint schemes" with
government bodies for the generation of electricity although the legislation
makes no mention of the operational and financial aspects of such arrangements.
Previously, the Mahaweli Development Board (MDB) constructed the Ukuwela
(earlier known as "Polgolla") 40MW hydro-plant as part of a multi-purpose
1/   MDA has succeeded MDB as the agency responsible for the accelerated
Mahaweli program.



- 21 -
project (with assistance from IDA Under Credit 174-CE) and it was agreed that
the power assets should be transferred to CEB on terms to be agreed with IDA.
Subsequently, under Credit 372-CE, GSL agreed to certain conditions 1/ to
ensure that CEB is sufficiently involved in the formulation of future joint
schemes, several of which are now planned under the accelerated Mahaweli
program, and, further, that the power assets are transferred to CEB on com-
pletion of the schemes on terms agreed with IDA. These requirements were
further discussed during negotiations and the earlier conditions are repeated
under the proposed credit.
4.08      The Ukuwela hydro-plant was commissioned in July 1976 and is oper-
ated by CEB but a satisfactory transfer of the assets has yet to be reflected
in CEB's accounts. An amount of Rs 115 million is included, provisionally,
under fixed assets in CEB's balance sheet at December 31, 1978 together with
an equivalent liability. The nature of this liability is uncertain as GSL has
not advised CEB of the terms under which such assets are to be transferred.
At negotiations, GSL's proposals were received and are being reviewed. It has
been agreed that this will be completed before December 31, 1980.
(c) Inventories
4.09      The estimated value of CEB's inventories at December 31, 1979 is
about Rs 200 million, which represents about 18 months supply of materials
and spare parts. This is due, in part, to stockbuilding because of the diffi-
culties in obtaining foreign exchange in earlier years. This level appears
excessive and inventory controls will be reviewed by the management consul-
tants (paragraph 2.09). Assurances have been obtained that CEB will reduce
inventories to a satisfactory level by end FY1982 and that GSL will ensure
the timely availability of foreign exchange for the future purchase of CEB's
inventory requirements. 2/
(d) Long-term Borrowings
4.10      Most of CEB's long-term loans are received from GSL under onlending
arrangements. GSL bears any foreign exchange risk on such loans which CEB
services in local currency. CEB is also responsible for servicing certain for-
eign loans, which were transferred from DGEU when CEB was established in 1969,
and on which CEB has so far borne the foreign exchange risk. CEB's long-term
borrowings do not reflect the latter liability in that the amounts outstanding
are based on the historic figures at the time of transfer to CEB, as reduced
by subsequent repayments. CEB has unsuccessfully attempted to recover from
GSL the debt service on such loans in excess of their historic value. 3/ GSL
1/   Development Credit Agreement 372-CE, S3.02.
2/   Under Development Credit Agreement 372-CE (Section 3.03) GSL agreed to
make available to CEB the foreign exchange needed to repair or replace
assets.
3/   CEB maintains a separate account, known as the 'Deputy Secretary,
Treasury - Parity Variance Account' for this purpose which, at
December 31, 1978, stood at about Rs 122 million.



- 22 -
has never acknowledged this liability and CEB may have to write-off this
amount against 'retained earnings' in future years. Nevertheless, GSL has
been asked to further review this matter urgently. An assurance has been
obtained that this matter will be resolved before December 31, 1980.
4.11      Tbh  terms for GSL funding to CEB in FYs 1978 and 1979 have yet to
be determined. This is unsatisfactory and again GSL has been asked to resolve
this matter before December 31, 1980.  Further, GSL has been asked to advise
CEB, in advance, of the terms of any future loans not covered by an onlending
agreement. (Such loans are made generally towards financing the local costs
of CEB projects).
Billing and Collection
4.12      CEB's billing and collection performance has been reasonably satis-
factory in recent years. Under Credit 372-CE, CEB's customer receivables on
the last day of each month should not exceed the aggregate billings for the
three months' ending on the same day. CEB has made considerable efforts to
meet this target and while the precise position at December 31, 1979 is not
yet known the August 31, 1979 figures indicated receivables equivalent to 3.6
month's billings. Some deterioration has occurred during 1979 in the position
of the local authorities (receivables at August 31, 1979 equal 5.7 months
billings) arising from:
(a)  the large tariff increase in December 1978 following which GSL
agreed that the local authorities should continue to pay at
the old rates and GSL would pay the balance to CEB on their
behalf;
(b)  the decision that CEB should take over the local authority
distribution systems (paragraph 2.12) which has led to an
increase in local authority arrears.
4.13      CEB's present billing and collection arrangements are centralized
at the head office in Colombo and most customer accounting is processed by
computer. CEB has considerable difficulty in recruiting satisfactory meter
reading staff and errors on meter readings are estimated in excess of 10%.
CEB is conscious of this problem and is constantly striving to secure improve-
ments. CEB estimates that over 50% of monthly bills are for less than Rs 15
(US$1) but is reluctant to introduce a fixed charge in view of potential
abuses. Accounting for large consumers, who comprise about 3,000 of CEB's
155,000 consumers but account for about 80% of CEB's sales revenues, is
handled by a separate section to facilitate prompt recovery proceedings.
4.14      CEB's existing obligation, under Credit 372-CE, to ensure that
customer receivables do not exceed three months' billings is repeated under
the proposed credit. Further, at negotiations, an assurance has been obtained
that (a) GSL will ensure the payment by the local authorities to CEB of all
current bills and (b) a program will be agreed to clear local authority
arrears. 1/
1/   Arrears will be settled as part of the transfer arrangements, but should
the transfer be delayed beyond September 1980, GSL will agree with IDA
a program by October 31, 1980.



- 23 -
Revenues and Tariffs
Present Position
4.15      The details of CEB's recent tariff structure are set out in Annex
12. CEB's tariffs were unchanged between April 1972 and December 1978 when
the present tariffs were introduced.  CEB's average tariff increased by about
80% from Rs 0.16 to 0.30/kWh (about USU2). The tariff level is still low by
international standards, reflecting the hitherto almost exclusive consumption
of hydro-generated energy. CEB's average cost, including depreciation, was
about Rs 0.25/kWh in FY1979. This situation will change significantly in the
early 1980's, a period during which CEB will need to generate considerable
thermal energy to meet demand pending the commissioning of the Victoria and
Kotmale hydro-stations in 1984/85. Most local authority retail tariffs are
below the level of CEB's and, following CEB takeover of the systems, retail
tariffs will be fixed by law at then current CEB levels.
4.16      CEB's present tariffs are insufficient in relation to both financial
rate of return and economic long-run marginal cost criteria. Present average
tariffs range from Rs 0.25/kWh for domestic consumers to between Rs 0.29-0.38/
kWh for non-domestic consumers. Domestic consumers pay a declining block
tariff - Rs 0.31/kWh for the first 50 units per month and Rs 0.21/kWh for
units in excess of 50: there is little incentive to conservation.
4.17      GSL approved the inclusion of a fuel adjustment clause in CEB's
tariff schedule in December 1978 to be used during periods of thermal generation
in the early 1980's. This was intended to reflect the increasing cost of
thermal generation based upon the price of fuel as against the price prevailing
on July 31, 1978. The higher rate will be charged to domestic consumers on
consumption in excess of 50 units per month and to non-domestic consumers on
units in excess of 75% of recent minimum monthly consumption. Over 60% of
domestic consumers use less than 50 units per month and so will be unaffected.
However, in FY79 CEB was not permitted to use the fuel adjustment clause and
in FY80 the higher rate for domestic consumption has been limited to Rs 0.50/
kWh. Although no accurate prediction can be made of the financial or con-
servation consequences of such an arbitrarily constructed clause CEB hopes to
recover fuel costs in full and to obtain some reduction in energy demand. 1/
Future Requirements
4.18      CEB is presently engaged on a study of long run marginal cost (LRMC)
pricing with technical assistance from the Bank: LRMC based - tariffs would
be of the order of Rs 1.80/kWh for low voltage consumers and R 0.80/kWh for
high voltage consumers. Presently, however, there is cross-subsidization of
domestic consumers for socio-political reasons. While it would be unreason-
able to expect the immediate adoption of LRMC pricing, some improvement in
the tariff structure is expected on completion of the present study. CEB has
1/   CEB intends to revise the fuel adjustment clause as part of the present
tariff review (para 4.19).



- 24 -
agreed to complete the present study and review the tariff structure before
December 31, 1980 in consultation with GSL and IDA, and will thereafter imple-
ment any agreed recommendations in accordance with a satisfactory timetable.
4.19      In order to improve CEB's financial performance and achieve an 8%
rate of return on average currently valued net fixed assets, a tariff increase
of about 65% is required prior to credit effectiveness: it is estimated that
an increase in the average tariff from Rs 0.30 to 0.50/kWh is needed to achieve
this target (in FY80 such an increase, from July 1, would produce about a 7%
rate of return).  CEB will also ensure that the cost of fuel is recovered in
full through the operation of the fuel adjustment clause.
4.20      A further assurance has been obtained that, thereafter, CEB will
review tariffs annually, before the start of CEB's financial year, to ensure
that revenues are sufficient to meet operating costs (including fuel costs)
and depreciation and to produce a rate of return on currently valued net fixed
assets of at least 8% annually.
4.21      From FY1982 tariffs will increase further from the present levels to
meet increases in operating costs, price escalation and CEB's contribution to
investment. In FY's 1982/83 CEB may have to increase tariffs to the equivalent
of a 10% rate of return in order to generate sufficient internal resources to
meet the local costs of its investment program. 1/ In FY1984, the average
tariff 2/ is estimated at Rs 0.76/kWh (USc/5/kWhT and, thereafter, following
the commissioning of the Mahaweli hydro-stations, it is estimated to increase
to Rs 1.17/kWh (USe 7-1/2 kWh) by FY1987. In real terms this represents a
doubling of tariffs from the present level.
Financing Plan
4.22      CEB's investment program through FY1984 is presently under review
following GSL's recent exercise to limit public expenditure. Most of the
hydro-power investment in the 1980's in Sri Lanka will be carried out under
the accelerated Mahaweli program with the power assets being transferred to
CEB on completion of each scheme (para 4.07). CEB is not expected to con-
tribute to these schemes which will be financed under bilateral arrangements.
However, CEB will have to provide transmission links to the proposed hydro-
stations and meet short-term power needs through 1985 by further thermal
investments. Following completion of present studies, CEB will prepare an
investment program through FY1984 and will submit this to IDA by October/
November 1980.
4.23      CEB's estimated financial requirements for the period FY1981 through
FY1984 and the sources of funds are summarized in Table 4.3.
1/   CEB officials indicated, at negotiations, that as an alternative CEB
may borrow from local banks.

foreign and local expenditures from GSL whose present lending rate is
below 10%. Inflation in Sri Lanka was 1977 15%, 1978 9%, 1979 18% and
is forecast at 1980 21%, 1981 15% and 1982 12%.

indicated in Annex 14.

set out in Annex 17.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Approach
5.01      The proposed project is an integral part of the total power sector
investment program in Sri Lanka, incorporating CEB's expenditure on generation,
1/   It is unlikely, based on the assumptions in Annex 16, that CEB will be
liable to pay either income tax or dividends on GSL equity (para 4.01(b))
in the period FY1980 through 1987.

transmission and distribution, the Mahaweli program of hydroelectric stations,
and the Samanalawewa hydro station. It includes transmission of the addi-
tional power generated to satisfy incremental demand at the load centers. Its
nature as a selected aggregate of individual lines and substations does not
lend itself to isolated justification although each component of the project
is justified as the solution to its own problem. The method employed in this
report is one of justifying the entire investment program, covering the
proposed project implicitly.
5.02      As several agencies are involved in the planning of parts of the in-
vestment program, conscious efforts to identify an overall least-cost solution
are only beginning. The only presently available aggregate investment program
therefore, is analyzed with respect to its feasibility in economic terms,
rather than compared to other potential programs.
Economic Costs and Benefits
5.03      The investment program in its present form is presented in Annex 18
Table 1. It represents all known planned expenditure relevant to the power
sector for the period 1980-1989, and is based on CEB demand forecasts. The
program implies a high marginal cost per incremental unit, a fact that is
likely to lead to significant tariff increases in the near future (para 4.21).
5.04      Where available, costs are expressed in CIF or equivalent border
terms. Local costs are converted to border prices using a shadow/market wage
ratio and a standard conversion factor (Annex 18, paras. 3 to 5). Economic
benefits arising from incremental supply to electricity consumers are calcu-
lated as the total willingness to pay including the consumers' surplus, assumed
to be approximated by the cost and extent of using alternative energy sources
for economic activities and lighting (Annex 18, paras 6 to 12).
Results
5.05      The use of expected 1980 tariff revenues (including fuel surcharge)
as a proxy for benefits leads to a minimum rate of return of 3%, indicating
that tariffs are well below marginal cost. An attempt was made to quantify
additional benefits in the form of user surplus (paragraph 5.04), assuming
various possible shapes of the demand curve for power. In economic terms,
the rate of return is likely to be between 8% and 16%, the best estimate being
about 12%. A 10% increase in costs would reduce the rate of return to about
10%, while a 10% decrease in costs would boost it to over 13% (Annex 18,
Table 3). Hence, the investment program in its aggregate form is justified
in economic terms.

Existing Transmission and Distribution Systems
The CEB system operates at 132 kV, 66 kV, 33 kV and 11 kV.
132 kV System
1.        The 132 kV system comprises 549 miles of line, of which 361 miles
are double circuit and 188 miles single circuit.
2.        At the heart of the system are the two largest hydro generating
stations, Polpitiya and Laksapana, connected together by four 132 kV circuits.
Wimalasurendra hydro station, at Norton Bridge, is also connected to Laksapana
by a short double circuit line.
3.        The largest load centre is at Kolonnawa near Colombo; it is fed by
four circuits from Polpitiya. There are tees off these lines to substations
at Thulhiriya and Oruwala. Also feeding into Kolonnawa are two circuits from
the steam power station at Kelanitissa.
4.        From the bars at Kolonnawa a single circuit runs south to substations
at Pannipitiya and Ratmalana, whilst another double circuit runs north up the
coast to substations at Sapugaskanda, Katunayaka, Bolowatta and Puttalam. From
Polpitiya a double circuit runs north up the middle of the island as far as
Anuradhapura, from where it continues as a single circuit by way of Kilinochchi
substation to Chunnakam in the northernmost part of the country. Between
Polpitiya and Anuradhapura there is a substation at Habarana, as well as an
incoming tee from the hydro station at Ukuwela.  From Anuradhapura a single
circuit tap takes off to Trincomalee on the east coast. Starting from the
busbars at Laksapana, a double circuit line runs down as far as Galle on
the south coast, with substations along the way at Balangoda and Deniyaya.
66 kV Network
5.        The system consists of about 214 miles of double circuit line
associated with the earliest power developments. In the old part of the
Laksapana station there are 66 kV busbars connected to Kolonnawa receiving
station by a double circuit line which also feeds substations at Padukka and
Avissawela. Another double circuit from Laksapana runs east, to substations
at Norton Bridge, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. From Badulla a single circuit
continues east as far as the hydro station at Inginiyagala; this section was
constructed for 132 kV but is at present operated at 66 kV. A third line
originating at Laksapana carries two circuits north as far as Kandy. From
there to Kurunegala there is a single circuit built for 132 kV but operated
at 66 kV.



ANNEX 3
- 33                        Page 2
6.        The 66 kV system is interconnected with the 132 kV system by interbus
transformers at Kolonnawa and Laksapana.
Subtransmission and Distribution
7.        The major load centres of Colombo are served by an 11 kV underground
system, but the remainder of the country is served by more than 3,000 route
miles of overhead lines at 33 kV, and 750 miles at 11 kV. Important points
have alternative supply routes. Most of the 132 kV substations are inter-
linked by 33 kV subtransmission lines to facilitate maintenance.
8.        The city of Colombo draws its power 'at 33 kV from Kolonnawa, where
there are four 30 MVA transformers. Four 33/11 kV substations designated A,
B, C and D are connected to Kolonnawa and to each other by about 28 miles of
underground cable. Each of these substations serves its own 11 kV ring. The
rings are normally open so that each is effectively two radial feeders, so
as to simplify protection. Most of the 11 kV/400 V substations on these rings
contain two 500 MVA transformers. Ring A serves a predominantly domestic market,
while the central ring B serves the main commercial and port areas. Ring C
covers the mainly industrial part of Colombo to the north, whilst D serves
other areas of domestic and commercial consumers.
9.        There is some overhead LT distribution in Colombo, but most is done
by underground cables. Radial feeders from the substations supply feeder
pillars, from where distribution cables run out and are tapped for consumer
service connections.

The work comprises the provision of a second circuit on existing
towers over a distance of 12 miles.
Ratmalana grid substation is at present fed by a single 132 kV
circuit from Kolonnawa. This substation serves the largest industrial
centre in Colombo, and the load on it has been growing rapidly. The sub-
station was originally equipped with two 15 MVA transformers, and these were
later uprated to 18 MVA each by the addition of forced air cooling. In
September 1979 the night peak was 34 MW, sustained from 6.30 to 9.30 pm; the
day load was 23 MW. New 30 MVA transformers had already been purchased and
were ready for despatch from the manufacturer's works by the end of 1979.
The Ratmalana substation load can at present be supported on a Sunday by
means of the 33 kV subtransmission, which will permit the first 132 kV circuit
to be de energized whilst work is in progress on the second.
This double circuit line will be tapped near Pannipitiya to feed
a new grid substation for the Parliamentary Complex at Kotte and industrial
loads in that vicinity.
1.2       There is at present a single circuit 132 kV line from Anuradhapura
to Trincomalee via Kantalai. A second circuit will be strung on the existing
towers from Anuradhapura as far as Kantalai, from where a new single circuit
will depart to Valachchenai. This piece of work is therefore subdivided into
two parts: -
1.2.1     Anuradhapura to Kantalai 132 kV transmission line
The work consists of stringing a second circuit on existing towers
over a distance of 40 miles.
1.2.2     Kantalai to Valachchenai 132 kV transmission line
The work is to build approximately 50 miles of single circuit line.
Trincomalee is at present served by one 10 MVA transformer and
another similar transformer has already been ordered to meet the increasing
load. A large flour mill in Trincomalee is expected to be completed in 1980;
owned by Prima, of Singapore, it is expected to cost Rs 350 M and will require

9 NW.  The coast near Trincomalee is expected to be the scene of the develop-
ment of a number of large new tourist hotels in the coming decade; such hotels
may be expected to demand up to .5 MW each. At Valachchenai there is a state
owned complex of paper mills, which draws 6 MW and is fed only by a 33 kV line
from Habarana, 50 miles away. Twenty miles of this line runs through jungle,
and poles are frequently damaged by elephants. Losses on the line are high
and the reliability of supply at the paper mills is unacceptable.
Construction of this 132 kV link will release the existing 33 kV
line to serve the territory between Kantalai and Valachchenai, where new
settlements will be arising out of the Mahaweli developments. This is good
country for growing rice, and the coastal area has potential for tourist
hotels.
1.3       Anuradhapura to Chunnakam 132 kV transmission line.
The work is to provide a second ciruit on the existing line over
a distance of 120 miles.
Chunnakam grid substation feeds the largest load centre in the
north of the country and is at present equipped with three 10 MVA transformers;
the load in September 1979 was 17.5 MW. Tenders have been called for two 30
MVA transformers to replace the present three, thus doubling the capacity.
Load flow studies indicate that voltage drop on the line will be unacceptable
by the end of 1980, and also that losses will have risen to about 5 MW at peak.
The second circuit will cure these problems. The northern part of the country
has only one circuit feeding it. There is an 8 MW diesel plant at Jaffna,
but this is costly to operate and is not large enough to support the load
by itself. The second circuit is needed to give security of supply; without
it, the diesel station will have to be run in order to maintain voltage.
Chunnakam is the site of a large cement factory taking about 10 MW;
because of the shortage of cement manufacturing capacity in the country there
are plans to expand this plant. Any outage on the existing line causes loss
of production of cement which is both scarce and valuable. This second circuit
will also improve security of supply to the Kilinochchi substation, which feeds
the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation, an important industrial consumer.
The second circuit will have to be installed with the first circuit
energised, as there is no 33 kV subtransmission link to this area.
2.   132 kV Substations and Switching Stations
2.1       Valachchenai 132/33 kV Substation.
The work will provide 2 bays of 132 kV and 6 bays of 33 kV switch-
gear and all associated equipment. The two 10 MVA transformers needed are
already on hand.

2.2       Ratmalana 132 kV switching station.
The work will add one bay of 132 kV switchgear and accessories.
2.3       Kolonnawa 132 kV switching station.
The work will add one bay of 132 kV switchgear and associated equip-
ment.
2.4       Anuradhapura.
The work will add three bays of 132 kV switchgear and associated
equipment.
3.   33 kV Subtransmission Lines
The project includes about 500 miles of 33 kV lines, consisting of
40 separate extensions varying in length from 4 miles to 24 miles. Four of
these extensions are needed for operational needs such as closing loops. The
remainder will serve new loads large enough to provide revenues sufficient to
justify the capital cost of the extensions. 33 kV extensions such as these
but less than 5 miles in length are normally covered by routine system augmenta-
tion provisions in CEB's annual budgets.
Attachment 1 to this Annex lists the estimated loads and consumers
or other justification for these extensions.
4.   Colombo Distribution System
The city of Colombo is at present fed from Kolonnawa near the north
east boundary of the city. A network of 33 kV cables from Kolonnawa feeds
four primary substations, which in turn feed consumer substations by an under-
ground network of 11 kV cables. The four primary substations will soon reach
the limit of their firm capacity and in order to meet load growth it is planned
to increase the capacity of two of the substations (where there is space to do
so), and to add two new substations.
CEB's engineering studies indicate that the most economical scheme
is to install 132/11 kV transformers in the new substations, fed by 132 kV
cables from Kolonnawa and Kelanitissa. Because of space restriction and in
order to avoid salt pollution from the nearby ocean these substations may be
indoors.
The work in this section of the project thus consists of: -
4.1       Extension to the 132 kV switchgear at Kolonnawa and Kelanitissa.
4.2       Supply and installation of 13 route kilometers of 132 kV cable to
form a single loop connecting the two supply points and the two substations.
A tentative route for the cable has been chosen and will be fixed after
detailed surveys.

4.3       Supply and erection of two 132/11 kV primary substations, located
at Fort and Union Place. Each substation will be equipped initially with
two 30 MVA, ONAF transformers, with provision for a third.
4.4       Modifications and additions to the 11 kV underground cable system
as necessary to share the load between the proposed new arrangement of six
substations.
4.5       The augmentation of existing substations C and D by the addition
of a third 33/11 kV, 12.5 MVA, ONAF transformer and accessories at each of
them.
4.6       The supply of transformers, switchgear and equipment for 40 consumer
substations, 11 kV/400 V, rated 500 to 750 kVA each. (Connection charges to
cover the cost of these substations will be levied on the consumers for whom
they are constructed).
5.   General Distribution
This part of the project provides for 250 consumer substations,
33 kV/400 V, of capacities varying from 50 to 500 kVA, and an average of 1/2
mile of 33 kV line with each substation.
6.   Vehicles and Tools
The project provides for the supply of 25 vehicles outside Colombo
and 6 for Colombo. Provision is also made for tools for CEB's forces who
will build 33 kV distribution lines.
7.   Buildings
The project includes various buildings associated with the transmis-
sion and distribution system: - an area office, stores and quarters at
Valachchenai; depots and quarters at Kilinochchi and Mannar; and quarters at
Anuradhapura and Ratmalana.
8.   Consultancies, Technical Assistance and Training
8.1       Engineering of 132 kV primary substations and cables.  The work
required is to review the conclusions of CEB's preliminary studies as to
capacity, layout, voltage, etc; to prepare detailed designs, drawings,
specifications and tender documents; to assist in the evaluation of tenders
and preparation of contracts; to inspect materials and equipment at the
factories and during installation on site; to assist with commissioning.
The work will be performed in collaboration with CEB's engineers. The
estimate provides for about 36 man months of engineering.
8.2       Engineering of 220 kV transmission lines, substations and switching
stations required to deliver power from Victoria and Kotmale into the Colombo
area. The estimate provides about 3% of a preliminary estimate of the capital
cost of these transmission facilities, equivalent to about 90 man months of
engineering.



- 41 -                    ANNEX 7
Page 5
8.3       Management Consultancy.  The estimate provides for about 50 man
months of consulting services. This is to cover reviewing the operation of
the systems installed by consultants in 1973 to ascertain why management
information is no longer being produced, and to rectify this deficiency; and
to provide for advisers to management while experience is gained.
8.4       Some foreign exchange costs may be incurred for training CEB staff
overseas in order to accomplish training objectives which are to be agreed
with IDA.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        Financial projections for CEB have been prepared for the period
through FY1987 using, as a base, CEB's audited accounts for FY1978, their
"best" estimates for FY1979 and budgetted figures for FY1980. It is not yet
possible to assess the impact of the takeover of the local authority distribu-
tion systems on CEB's revenues or operational costs.
IMCOME STATEMENT       (ANNEX 13)
Revenues
2.        Energy sales figures are taken from the "Load Forecast through 1990"
(Annex 3). CEB's present average tariff is Rs 0.30/kWh and this has been
adjusted annually from FY1981 in order to produce at least CEB's covenanted
8% rate of return (ROR) on currently valued net fixed assets. In FYs 1982
and 1983 a 10% ROR is needed to fund CEB's contribution to the investment
program.
3.        A tariff increase to Rs. 0.50/kWh in FY1980, which is required as a
condition of credit effectiveness, would provide an 8% ROR in a full fiscal
year but it is unlikely to take effect before July 1, 1980. On this assump-
tion the ROR would be 6.6% in FY1980.
4.        It is assumed that fuel costs are fully recovered each year through
the operation of CEB's fuel adjustment surcharge.
5.        An annual allowance of about 2-1/2% has been made for bad debts.
OPERATING COSTS
6.        Operating costs have been projected from the FY1980 budget base.
Increases have been allowed for the commissioning of new plant, transmission
and distribution systems, for the increasing use of fuel oil and for inflation
based on present guidelines.
7.        Fuel costs are based on the projected thermal energy requirements
indicated in Annex 4 and using local rates of price escalation.
8.        Generation, transmission and distribution operating and maintenance
expenses in FY1980 represent about 2-1/2% of CEB's gross fixed assets. These
costs have been projected assuming an annual incremental 0 and M cost of 2-1/2%
of newly commissioned assets and weighted rates of price escalation to reflect



- 54 -
ANNEX 16
Page 2
the estimated imported and local components of such costs.
9.        Depreciation is calculated at 2 3/4% of gross fixed assets, revalued
annually ur aig weighted rates of price escalation.
10.       Administrative costs are based on a 5% annual rate of growth combined
with local rates of price escalation and include Business Turnover Tax at 1% of
CEB's sales revenues.
11.       Annual contributions to CEB's Insurance Fund are at the rate of 1/10%
of CEB gross fixed assets.
FLOW OF FUND STATEMENT        (ANNEX 14)
CEB Investment program and Financing Plan
12.       CEB was in the process of reviewing its investment program at the time
of appraisal following a request from GSL to reduce investment in the period
through 1983. CEB's submission comprises the following schemes the costs of
which have been increased for price escalation in order to assess CEB's financial
requirements through 1987. Funding assumptions are set out below. The program
beyond 1983 is very tentative.

13.       All new foreign loans are assumed to be onlent to CEB for 20 years,
with 3 years grace, at a 10% rate of interest.
Mahaweli Hydro Developments
14.       This program is supervised by MDA and is financed through bilateral
arrangements with donor countries. On completion of the works the hydro-
electric components will be transferred to CEB for subsequent operation. The
total costs of each scheme will be apportioned between CEB and MDA on an
agreed basis. In order to determine the amount to be transferred to CEB MDA's
latest estimated costs for the Victoria, Kotmale and Randenigala projects were
adjusted for price escalation, the cost of the hydro-electrical components
were identified and the residual costs were assumed to be apportioned on a
50:50 basis.
15.       GSL has agreed with the U.K. to transfer the Victoria hydro-station
to CEB with a corresponding amount of loan with interest at 10% to be repaid
to GSL over 25 years in equal annual installments. These terms are reasonable.
No agreement has been reached in respect of the other Mahaweli projects; transfer
arrangements similar to those for Victoria have been assumed.
BALANCE SHEET (Annex 15)
Fixed Assets
16.       CEB's fixed assets have been revalued to FY1978 in accordance with
the movement of indices previously agreed with IDA. A further revaluation of
37-1/2% will be required in CEB's FY1979 accounts. Thereafter, annual re-
valuations have been projected based upon current guidelines of price escala-
tion for foreign and local goods. Accumulated depreciation has been similarly
revalued each year and the balance credited to CEB's Revaluation Reserve.
17.       Work-in-progress represents capital expenditures under the proposed
project and other CEB projects indicated at paragraph 12 above; transfers
have been made to the fixed asset account on commissioning of new facilities.
Current Assets
18.       The following assumptions have been made:
(a) Accounts receivable: equivalent to 3 months billings.
(b) Inventories are to be reduced to the equivalent of 4 months
operational materials requirements and six weeks fuel requirements
by December 31, 1982 and thereafter maintained at these levels;
a stock of construction materials (Rs 50 million) has also been
assumed.
(c) Sundry Receivables have been adjusted annually for local price
escalation.

(d) DST Parity Variance represents the amount shown owing by the
Treasury in CEB's FY1978 accounts (Rs 121.8 million)
in respect of the additional foreign exchange cost of certain
foreign loans transferred to CEB in 1969 (SAR paragraph 4.10).
Equity
19.       Equity comprises CEB's initial capital, as increased from time to
time by GSL grants towards construction costs (mainly rural electrification),
consumer contributions, revaluation surplus and retained earnings (operational
surplus).
Long-term Debt
20.       Long-term debt comprises (a) existing GSL loans to CEB including
those made under onlending arrangements with IBRD, IDA, ADB, OPEC etc. (to
cover foreign costs of previous and ongoing projects), and (b) loans required
in accordance with paragraphs 12-15 above to fund CEB investment program
through 1987.
Current Liabilities
21.       These comprise accounts payable, deposits and sundry items which
have been adjusted annually for local price escalation and current maturities
of long-term loans (representing amortization due in the following fiscal year).

Sixth Power Project
(Ceylon Electricity Board)
Economic Analysis
Method
1.        The proposed project constitutes a part of the transmission expend-
iture necessary to transmit additional power from existing and future generating
stations to the load centers. It is an integral part of the total power sector
investment program and can be justified only as part of the latter rather than
as an independent, self-contained project. The approach adopted in this report,
therefore, is one of justification of the entire power sector investment program
in its present state, allowing the conclusion that the part covered by the proposed
project is implicitly justified.
2.        The analysis is complicated by the fact that CEB, the authority
ultimately responsible for supplying power at the retail level, controls only
the smaller part of total sector investment. While account is taken of power
demand forecasts to a certain extent, the input of CEB into the planning of the
implementation of the Mahaweli Program is limited. There is, therefore, no
clear-cut sector-wide effort to formulate a least-cost investment program to
satisfy forecast demand. This situation requires an analysis of the overall
economic feasibility of the only existing investment program by comparing its
capital and current costs with the implicit benefits derived from the availability
of additional power supply.
Economic Costs
3.        Cost items are valued at CIF or equivalent border prices, where
available. The remaining local costs are split into labor and other local cost
components, and adjusted by a shadow/market wage ratio of 0.67, and by a standard
conversion factor of 0.91.
4.        The foreign (CIF) and local (domestic price) components of new capacity
are estimated to be as follows:
Foreign (%)   Local (%)   of which Labor (%)
Gas turbines                            95             5               2.5
Diesel thermal                          80            20              10
Hydro                                   75            25              12.5
Transmission & Distribution             68            32              25.5

ANNEX 18

5.        Operating and maintenance expenditure is assumed to amount to 3% of
cumulative investment, with equal shares of labor and other local cost. Fuel
cost is based on the actual production cost of light diesel and furnace oil in
the Colombo refinery: the bulk of the domestic consumption of `lese products
is supplied from domestic production rather than from imports of the refined
fuel. The fuel cost amounts to Rs 0.44/kWh for diesel thermal plant, and
Rs. 1.03/kWh for gas turbines.
Economic Benefits
6.        Benefits of electricity supply, accruing to final consumers, are
assessed as the willingness to pay for a given quantity of energy for specific
purposes. Analysis of this willingness to pay is based on (i) tariff revenue,
(ii) observed expenditure on alternative energy sources in the absence of
electricity supply, and (iii) on sample interviews. The sum of revenue and
consumer surplus is estimated as the area under the derived demand curve for
energy required for output production or lighting. Low, medium and high
estimates for user surplus are examined.
7.        Domestic electricity consumption.  Almost 90% of Sri Lanka households
are using kerosene lamps for lighting; in rural areas, this percentage rises
to 97%. Domestic uses of electricity other than lighting are limited (with
the exception of the Colombo metropolitan area): about 85% of total domestic
electricity consumption is estimated to be used for lighting purposes. In
the absence of electricity supply, households would use kerosene: the total
amount of lighting, however, would be significantly lower due to the high cost
of the kerosene alternative. About 15% of present total domestic electricity
use can be considered minimum lighting requirements. This portion is valued
at the economic cost of Rs 6.30 per kWh equivalent. The remainder of consump-
tion is assumed to be valued at a price declining to Rs 0.59/kWh (the average
1980 domestic tariff revenue) at the margin: the average value of this portion
is Rs 3.45 per kWh equivalent. These values are applied to CEB-supplied
domestic consumption as well as to that part of the "bulk supply" to municipal-
ities, that is estimated to be domestic use.
8.        The cost of kerosene lighting is arrived at as follows, assuming a
lamp with a light output of 60 W equivalent, used for 1,100 hours per year for
5 years:
Capital cost                      : Rs 325.00
Annuitized charge                 : Rs 1.40/kWh
(13% opportunity cost of capital)
Fuel cost:
0.08 1/hour at Rs 5.46/1          : Rs 4.90/kWh
Total Cost                        : Rs 6.30/kWh



ANNEX 18
Page 3
9.        Commercial consumption.  As with domestic consumption, it is assumed
that 15% of electricity consumption would be replaced by kerosene lighting,
the remainder declining in value to the consumer up to the margin of about
Rs 1.10/kWh, the average commercial tariff revenue including fuel surcharge.
The average economic value of Rs 3.70 is applied to commercial consumption.
Domestic and commercial consumption together (including their shares of CEB
"bulk supply") account for about 44% of total electricity consumption.
10.       Industrial consumption.  For most of industry, the alternative to
power supply is own diesel generation. This can be in the form of maintaining
a standby diesel generating set for protection against power outages, or of
supplying the complete energy requirement of the production process. Both
options are used by industrial organizations in Sri Lanka. In 1979 about 25%
of industrial energy in the country was supplied by isolated diesel generation
outside the power grid. It is this share of incremental industrial electricity
demand that is assumed to replace diesel generation, and is valued at Rs 1.00/kWh,
the average economic cost of operating a diesel set full time. The remaining
75% of industrial demand are assumed to be valued at a price declining to the
margin of Rs 0.95/kWh (the average industrial tariff revenue), resulting in an
average value of Rs 0.98/kWh.  Industry at present accounts for about 55% of
incremental electricity demand.
11.       The average economic cost of operating a diesel generating set of
about 100 KVA capacity at a rate of 4,400 annual hours for 20 years is arrived
at as follows:
Capital cost/KW                  Rs 3,000
Capital cost/KW/year             Rs   427
Spares/KW/year                   Rs    50
Labor/KW/year                    Rs   100
Total/KW/year                    Rs   577 = Rs 0.13/kWh
Fuel Cost:
0.06 gals/KVA/hour at Rs 15/gal             = Rs 0.90/kWh
Total Cost/kWh :                              Rs 1.03/kWh
say, Rs 1.00/kWh

12.       The total economic weighted value of a kWh of incremental electricity
demand is summarized as follows:
Consumer Category       % of consumption             Value (Rs/kWh)
Full Potential   Conservative
Surplus           Surplus
Domestic/Commercial              7                  6.30               6.30
Domestic                        18                  3.45               0.59
Commercial                      19                  3.70               1.10
Industrial                      14                  1.00               1.00
Industrial                      41                  0.98               0.95
Street Light                     1                  0.75               0.75
Total weighted                 100                  2.31               1.29
13.       If tariff revenues are taken to be a proxy of the minimum benefit,
the basic tariff as proposed for 1980 by CEB plus the average expected fuel
surcharge to be billed to the consumer is an appropriate measure for the years
1980-84. The average surcharge will be on the order of 50% of basic tariff.
The weighted tariff value is summarized as follows:
Consumer Category       % of consumption       Value (Rs/kWh)
With Surcharge
Domestic                       21                  0.59
Commercial                     23                   1.10
Industrial                     55                  0.95
Street Light                    1                  0.75
Weighted                                           0.91
Cost/Benefit Analysis
14.       The entire power sector investment program as known at the time of
appraisal is presented in Table 1. The Mahaweli (non-CEB) hydro projects
of Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, and Rantembe are assumed to be guided by
power sector needs rather than irrigation requirements in their implementation,
and the total cost of the dams is included.
15.       The economic costs of this investment program are compared to the
benefits arising from incremental sales 1/ made possible by this investment,
using tariff as well as economic valuation of electricity supply and CEB
estimates of demand.  As a sensitivity analysis, the cost of the entire pro-
gram is varied by 10% up and down.  All cost and benefit streams for the base
case and the delayed case are shown in Table 2.  Local costs are presented
after adjustment to border prices.  The exercise is conducted in terms of con-
stant 1980 prices. For purposes of comparison, benefits are also expressed
1/   Estimated at the time of formulation of the investment program.

in terms of tariff revenue rather than in economic terms, implying a substan-
tial underestimate of benefits. Results are presented in Table 3.
16.       Benefits and costs are underestimated, if the irrigation component
of the Mahaweli program is taken into account. Additional costs would be
the downstream irrigation investment expenditures, additional benefits the
increased net agricultural output resulting from irrigation. Table 3
indicates that the power sector investment program including the complete
Mahaweli headworks is likely to be economically justified, using electricity
benefits alone. The total power-cum-irrigation investment package is there-
fore likely to be justified.
