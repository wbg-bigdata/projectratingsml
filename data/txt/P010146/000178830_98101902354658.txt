INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA FOR A
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for
the equivalent of US$19.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a
sixth power project. The entire proceeds of the Credit would be relent to
the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at 10% per annum for a term of 20 years,
including 3 years' grace, with the Government bearing the foreign exchange
risk. The Government is making co-financing arrangements with the Saudi
Fund for Development for a Loan of US$20 million to help finance the pro-
posed project (paragraph 48).
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent economic report, "Development in Sri Lanka:  Issues
and Prospects" (Report No. 1937-CE, March 22, 1978) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 23, 1978. An economic mission visited Sri Lanka
in December 1979 to prepare an economic report which is scheduled for distri-
bution in May 1980. This section draws on the preliminary findings of that
mission. Country Data are provided in Annex I.
3.        After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy
is experiencing rapid growth and unprecedentedly high levels of savings and
investment. This remarkable turnaround is explained by the Central Bank
of Ceylon as the "spontaneous reaction of a long repressed economy to its
liberalization by the new economic policies initiated in 1977." Until 1977,
Sri Lanka's growth performance was below both need and potential. Although
GDP growth in the 1960s, at 4.4% per annum, was above the average for low
income countries, growth slackened sharply in the 1970-77 period to 2.9%
per annum, just below the average for low income countries. Through much of
this period, the terms of trade deteriorated steadily, eroding even these
modest gains: as a consequence, per capita gross national income rose by a
mere 0.9% per annum during the 1960-76 period. The slowdown in economic growth
in the 1970-77 period is attributable to a combination of factors, including
inadequate investment, poor management of the economy and a policy environ-
ment unconducive to growth and investment, which were compounded by bad weather
and a sharp rise in the cost of imported food and fuel.
4.        The three tree crops--tea, rubber and coconuts--which are still
the mainstay of the economy, suffered from low replanting and inadequate in-
centives. These problems were exacerbated by a dual exchange rate, introduced
1/   This part is substantially the same as Part I of the Report and Recommen-
dation of the President to the Executive Directors on a proposed credit
to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for a Second Water
Supply and Sewerage Project Report No. P-2820-CE, dated May 21, 1980).

in 1968, that discriminated against these crops, and by the uncertainties
surrounding a protracted nationalization (1972-75) of the larger estates.
After the exceptional output growth of the 1960s, rice yields and cropping
intensities declined in the 1970s due to poor institutional support. Invest-
ment in manufacturing was low, and the inefficiency of most public and private
sector firms nurtured in a highly protected environment resulted in industrial
growth of less than 2% per annum. The only bright spots were subsidiary food
crops and industrial exports which benefited from good incentives.
5.        An inadequate public savings effort, caused by inelastic revenues
and an uncontrolled increase in recurrent expenditures, inhibited public
investment. Private savings and investment were constrained by an unfavor-
able policy environment. The high incremental capital output ratio in the
1970s (5.5 as against 3.5 in the 1960s), reflected the fact that the invest-
ment that did take place was both inefficient and highly capital intensive.
6.        The poor growth rates and the slow changes in the structure of
output matched neither the jobs nor the changes in employment structure that
the labor force required. Slow output growth, the excessive capital intensity
of investment, the mismatch between the job aspirations of those with post-
primary education and the jobs available to them, the post war demographic
bulge, and rising female participation rates contributed to a massive increase
in open unemployment, estimated at over 1 million, or nearly 20% of the labor
force in 1977.
7.        In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
Sri Lanka has about one and one-half times the life expectancy, almost thrice
the literacy, one-quarter the infant mortality and half the birth rate that
would be expected for a country at its per capita income level. Nutrition
levels have been adequate, and in the 1960s there were parallel gains in
income distribution.
8.        Improvements in the quality of life, in particular the rise in health
standards, the spread of education and the availability of subsidized food,
have been important factors in the decline in mortality. The increasing age
of marriage, the spread of female education and employment, and a vigorous
family planning program, have also contributed to a sharp decline in fertility.
As a consequence, the growth rate of population has dropped from 2.6% per annum
in the 1953-63 intercensal period to 2.0% per annum in the 1963-73 period.
Allowing for net migration, population is currently increasing at only 1.7%
per annum.
9.        The gains in the social field were made possible by favorable initial
conditions. Compulsory primary education was introduced as early as 1901. The
food ration was introduced in 1942. Thus, at the time of Independence in 1948,
Sri Lanka already enjoyed high levels of adult literacy and life expectancy.
These initial gains were consolidated and expanded in the post-Independence
period through large expenditures on social services and the food subsidy,
which accounted for two-fifths to one-half of government revenues in the 1960s
and early 1970s. These expenditures were traditionally financed by harnessing
the surpluses of Sri Lanka's three major tree crops (tea, rubber, and coconut),



-3-
which provided the Government with both an easy revenue source and foreign
exchange earnings. These surpluses began to disappear in the late 1960s as
government policies discriminated against these crops and the terms of trade
deteriorated. With growth in other productive sectors in the economy also
decelerating in the 1970-77 period, the budgetary resources available for
social programs were squeezed by inelastic revenues and rapid inflation. As
a consequence, expenditures on social services other than the food subsidy
began to decline as a proportion of total current expenditures and GDP, threat-
ening the hard-won gains in health and education. In sum, the economy was no
longer generating the resources needed to sustain a large program of welfare
expenditures. Moreover, the very size of those programs reduced the scope
of policy makers to shift resources to development.
10.       The policy changes introduced in 1977, following the election of
the United National Party, were intended to break this vicious circle. The
new Government identified its objectives as the revival and resuscitation
of the economy and increased employment through (i) increased capacity utili-
zation in the productive sectors, (ii) stimulation of savings and investment,
and (iii) efforts to encourage exports and import substitution in foodgrains.
A program of policy reforms was developed in close consultation with the IMF.
Its principal aim was to dismantle controls over resource allocations and
initiate price adjustments with a view to establishing more realistic relative
prices. These reforms were supported initially by an IMF standby arrangement
covering 1978 for SDR 93 million. On January 26, 1979, the Fund's Executive
Board approved an SDR 260 million Extended Arrangement covering the 1979-81
period.
11.       The following broad policy reforms have been introduced:
Exchange Rate Reform: The exchange rate was unified on November 16,
1977 at a depreciated rate of Rs 16 - US$1.00 and allowed to float.
This implied a depreciation of 46% against the official rate prevail-
ing prior to unification, 11.2% with respect to the Foreign Exchange
Entitlement Certificate rate, and 29.5% with respect to a transactions-
weighted average rate of the two markets. 1/
Import Liberalization: The trade and payments regime was liberal-
ized. With the exception of foodgrainu and petroleum products,
public sector import monopolies were terminated. Prior licensing
of imports was abolished for all but a handful of commodities. The
tariff structure was revised and simplified.
Interest Rate Reform: To encourage financial savings and discourage
speculative imports, interest rates were raised sharply.
Price Controls: These ended for most commodities.
1/   Prior to unification, all exports other than tea, rubber and coconut
products and all imports other than food, fertilizers and drugs were
channelled through the certificate market. Since November 1972, the
FEEC rate was maintained at a 65% premium over the official rate.



- 4 -
Budgetary Policies: The unification and depreciation of the exchange
rate caused tree crops export tax revenues and the cost of food,
fertilizer and petroleum subsidies to rise sharply. Business Turnover
Tax rates were substantially lowered and rationalized to be con-
sistent with the new import tariff and exchange rate. To limit
the increase in cost of food subsidies, rice and sugar rations were
initially confined to the poorer half of the population, and the
subsidy on imported wheat flour was reduced through a series of
adjustments in the domestic price. On September 1, 1979 the Gov-
ernment introduced a system of food and kerosene stamps for families
with monthly incomes less than Rs 300 to replace specific food sub-
sidies and rationing, and to target benefits to the poorest. Ini-
tially about seven million persons were issued with food and kero-
sene stamps. To offset the adverse impact of these changes on real
incomes, public sector wages have twice been adjusted upwards, and
in February 1978 an income supplement was introduced at Rs 50 per
month to benefit the poorest households in which one or more persons
had no gainful employment. Public corporations were asked to pass
on cost increases, except in the case of fertilizer, petroleum,
milk and public transport, where price increases were initially
deferred to cushion the impact on consumers. The Government has
subsequently made sizable adjustments in flour, rice and sugar
prices, bus fares, and petroleum prices. The burden of subsidies
and transfers has, as a consequence fallen from around 9% of GNP
in 1978 to around 5% in 1980. These changes, taken together with
higher aid receipts, have permitted a sizable step up in capital
expenditures.
Tax Reform: The tax structure has been rationalized and simplified
with a view to increasing the elasticity of revenues. The burden of
personal and company taxation has been lowered.
Agricultural Pricing Policies: The domestic procurement price for
rice was increased by 21%. With the related increase in flour prices,
incentives for paddy and other flour substitutes benefited. Fresh
coconut prices have also been increased by 30% and the export duty
on coconut products has been appropriately adjusted. While the uni-
fication of the exchange rate ended formal discrimination against
tree crops, the export duty on tea was initially set at a level which
effectively siphoned off most of the benefits to the Government. As
tea prices fell and production costs rose in 1978-79, the Government
responded to the reduced producer margins by a lowering of taxes on
tea. Further adjustments in both the structure and level of tea
taxation will be needed to maintain and improve incentives.
12.       The economic reforms have been accompanied by a major effort at
stepping up public investment. The Government's capital expenditures jumped
from 6% of gross national product at market prices in 1977 to an average
of 13% in 1978 and 1979, as government departments responded to an improved
budgetary resource position by embarking on long overdue replacement invest-
ments and new projects that had been shelved earlier for lack of resources.
The Government has also embarked on four major new programs which are to be



the lead projects in a five-year rolling public investment program.  These are:
(i) Accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program, by
far the largest multi-purpose river basin development ever undertaken in Sri
Lanka; (ii) a 200 square-mile free trade zone north of Colombo under a newly
constituted Greater Colombo Economic Commission which has established the
first Investment Promotion Zone near Colombo's international airport, Katuna-
yake, and is planning others, and has approved some 92 proposals involving a
total investment of US$176 million by December 1979; (iii) a massive housing
and urban renewal program with its main focus on the Colombo metropolitan
region; and (iv) the construction of a new capital complex at Kotte, a suburb
of Colombo.
13.       These four programs will together cost an estimated Rs 25 billion,
or 43% of the projected Rs 60 billion public investment program over the
1980-84 period. The Government's tentative macro-economic scenario envisages
public investment taking one-half of total investment which is expected to
average an ambitious 23% of GNP in 1980-84 as against 16% in the early 1970s.
To enable this increase to materialize, gross domestic savings are expected
to average 16.3% of GNP, and net external inflows nearly 7%. This implies
a substantial increase in external inflows which averaged 2.3% of GNP in the
1970-76 period. Official development assistance is to finance 54% of public
investment.
14.       The underlying public investment strategy is to balance the large
investment requirements of the Government's high priority programs against the
urgent rehabilitation and fresh investment needs in other sectors. The main
thrust of the public sector program is to lay the foundation for longer term
development, both by improving the efficiency of use of existing infrastructure
investments and by expanding the longer term growth capacity of the economy.
The strategy thus implicitly relies on the private sector to respond to the
economic reforms and the stimulus of the public sector investment program,
and provide much of the short-term growth.
15.       The initial response of the economy to the policy reforms and the
accompanying acceleration in public investment has been encouraging. Economic
growth between 1977 and 1980 is estimated at an impressive 6.7% per annum.
This growth has been shared by almost all sectors of the economy, with the
most dynamic sectors being construction, mining and quarrying, electricity,
gas and water and manufacturing. The only major exception has been the
tree crop sector. This impressive performance is due to a number of factors
including the improved availability of inputs following import liberalization,
an increased role for the private sector in distribution, and the removal
of price controls.
16.       Domestic savings reached 15% of GNP in 1978 and 1979, well above
historical levels. Financial savings, as measured by fixed and savings
deposits, have responded dramatically to the change in interest rates.
Public and private investment have also risen sharply, bringing total invest-
ment to 20% of GNP in 1978 and 25% in 1979. This has been reflected in a
four-fold increase in capital goods imports from $84 million in 1977 to an
estimated $350 million in 1979. Much of the investment reflected pent up
demand for replacement of antiquated equipment in industry and transport.



- 6 -
Investment approvals in 1978 and 1979 for manufacturing reached record
levels; those involving foreign collaboration totalled $300 million, of
which over one-half were in the new free trade zone. Although there is
little data available on employment, the Central Bank estimates a sizable
(102,000) increase in the public sector and organized private sector employ-
ment in 1978 as against an increase of 40,000 in 1977. This would have
contributed to the fall in open unemployment from an estimated one million
to 900,000, or 16% of the labor force.
17.       The exchange rate adjustment, other policy induced price increases
and related wage increases, and the removal of price controls contributed
significantly to inflationary pressures in 1978 and 1979. However, these
pressures were moderated in 1978 by a bumper paddy harvest, increased capacity
utilization in the economy, increased availability of imports and the benefi-
cial effects of competition from imports and in domestic distribution. Thus
average annual inflation was held to 9% in 1978. There was a marked deterior-
ation in 1979 - average annual inflation rose to 18% (32% on December 1978
to December 1979 basis) due to an acceleration in money supply expansion on
account of the continued buildup in gross external assets and the rapid
domestic bank credit expansion, and to a sharp increase in construction sector
costs, as the increase in investment levels led to shortages of construction
materials and skilled labor.
18.       Not surprisingly, the current account deficit in the balance of
payments rose sharply to $150 million in 1978 and $360 million in 1979.
After a strong surge in 1978, merchandise imports rose by a further 41% in
1979 to $1,450 million, or twice 1977 levels, reflecting sizable increases
in the cost of petroleum imports, and substantial real increases in non-food
consumer goods, intermediate and investment goods imports. Exports rose
by a more modest 18% to $900 million in 1979. However, as in 1978, the
current account deficit was more than offset by non-monetary capital inflows,
resulting in an increase in net foreign exchange reserves by a further
$46 million. Gross reserves rose by $121 million to $519 million at end
1979, due largely to drawings on the Extended Fund Facility. Reserves are
currently equivalent to about four months imports. Preliminary balance of
payments projections for 1980 suggest a further marked deterioration in the
current account deficit to $600 million, due in part to the sharp rise in
the cost of petroleum imports. Net petroleum imports as a percentage of non-
petroleum exports will rise from 14% in 1979 to 26% in 1980. At currently
projected aid levels, net reserves are likely to fall by nearly $60 million
in 1980.
19.       Success in attaining the Government's medium-term development
objectives is conditional on a number of factors. The Government will need to
carefully continue reviewing the content of its public investment program. As
presently proposed, it will severely strain the domestic availability of
skilled manpower and construction materials. To the extent that this forces a
greater reliance on imports, it will further strain the balance of payments,
which is already under severe pressure on account of the oil price increase
and other factors that will result in a deterioration in the terms of trade.
Moreover, domestic production and exports will need to increase at a rapid
rate to ensure the required level of import substitution and export promotion



implicit in the Government's macro-framework. This, in turn, will require
further efforts to improve price and export incentives, and the quality of
management in the public sector, and particularly in the tree crop sector.
A further essential precondition is an adequate level of public savings to
generate the required resources for public investment without infringing on
the financing needs of the private sector. While the Government has already
undertaken a number of important resource mobilization measures, this will
need to be an area of continuing vigilance. However, success will ultimately
be contingent on larger aid flows which are needed to ensure that an ambitious
development program, with a strong rehabilitation component, can be implemented
within the framework of a liberalized import regime. The Government is antici-
pating that aid flows will finance over one-half of the public investment pro-
gram, including considerable local cost financing. In this way, the Govern-
ment's own considerable resource mobilization efforts will be supplemented,
while at the same time providing strong balance of payments support during
this period of economic transformation.
20.       Aid donors have responded enthusiastically to the new policy environ-
ment in Sri Lanka. Aid commitments in 1978 from members of the Sri Lanka Aid
Group totalled US$362 million, an increase of 60% over 1977. Aid commitments
in 1979 totalled a massive $660 million, including $220 million for the acce-
lerated Mahaweli Program. The grant element of aid commitments is currently
around 63% and is expected to improve further. The debt service ratio in 1979,
excluding Fund repurchases, stood at around 8.0%, declining from 15.0% in 1977
and 10.0% in 1978, due to improved export earnings and the decline in outstand-
ing short- and medium-term borrowings.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
21.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has made eight loans totalling US$72.9 million (net of cancellations)
and 24 credits totalling US$342.5 million (net of cancellations and exchange
adjustments) in support of 30 projects. About 42% of Bank Group assistance
has been for agriculture (irrigation, agricultural, and dairy development),
14% for power, and the remainder for development finance company operations,
highways, a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials for
industry), water supply, road transport, small and medium industries and tech-
nical assistance. Eight loans and eight credits have been fully disbursed
so far. During FY80, IDA credits for a total of US$132.0 million have been
approved for a Technical Assistance Project, a Road Passenger Transport Proj-
ect, a Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project, a Telecommunications Project
and a second Water Supply and Sewerage project. 1/ Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Group operations as of March 31, 1980, together with notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
1/   The latter three projects are scheduled to be presented to the Board
before the proposed Sixth Power Project.

22.       An IFC equity investment of about US$100,000 equivalent in the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and an IFC non-revolving
line of credit of US$2.0 million to the government-owned Bank of Ceylon for
on-lending to private small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises were
approved in FY78. IFC also approved an investment of US$2.32 million in a
synthetic textile mill, and US$986,000 in a polypropylene bag manufacturing
plant in FY79. IFC has very recently approved an increase in equity invest-
ment of about US$51,000 equivalent in DFCC.
23.       The Bank Group's current strategy is focused on the agricultural
sector to support Government efforts to increase food production and reduce
its dependence on food imports, and to raise productivity, employment, incomes
and living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. Projects to sup-
port basic infrastructure are also included. In addition to providing financ-
ing for the ongoing Mahaweli Ganga Development Project II and the Mahaweli
Ganga Technical Assistance Project, the Bank Group is assisting the Government
of Sri Lanka in accelerating the implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Develop-
ment Program (paragraph 12) principally through the coordination of external
assistance for project preparation and implementation. It is expected that
significant investment opportunities for IDA and other Aid Group members will
flow from this effort. A rural development project and a Mahaweli Ganga
Development III project are being appraised.
24.       The Bank Group presently accounts for 10.3% (IBRD, 3.3%; IDA, 7.0%)
of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and disbursed, and 6.5% (almost totally
IBRD) of debt service. It is projected that the Bank Group's share in total
external debt will increase to 19% by 1985 (with the IBRD's share declining
to 0.7%). The Bank and IDA shares in the debt service are expected to decline
to about 4% by 1985.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
25.       The source of most of Sri Lanka's energy at present is firewood.
Wood provides about 62% of the total energy, the rate of consumption per
capita being estimated as between 180 and 320 kg per year. Although the
per capita use of wood has increased very little over the past fifteen years,
there is concern about deforestation. A forestry sector review mission by
IDA has recently completed its work and is currently reviewing its findings
with the Government.
26.       There are no known reserves of coal, oil or natural gas.  Explora-
tion is in progress, and drilling both onshore and offshore will be started
in 1980, but the likelihood of substantial finds is small. The sole importer
and refiner of petroleum and its products is Ceylon Petroleum Corporation
(CPC). Its refinery has a capacity of 2.35 million tons per year and produces
enough gasoline for the country, but part of the needs for diesel and kerosene
are imported. More heavy furnace oil is produced than domestic needs, the
surplus being exported as bunker fuel. Domestic prices of all fuels except
gasoline are subsidized. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) is not important at
present but it is in excess supply, is relatively cheap and its use is likely
to increase.



- 9 -
27.       The total potential for hydro energy in the country is estimated
as 6,400 GWh per year. The yield from existing hydro developments is about
1,500 GWh per year, and the additions now planned will increase it to about
3,740 GWh by 1991. This may exhaust all feasible hydro sites with potential
in excess of 15-20 MW. A survey of smaller hydro projects is planned.
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
28.       The CEB is a public corporation, established in 1969 to replace
the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (DGEU). It is governed
by a seven member Board appointed by the Government, which has reserved control
of tariffs, capital investment, borrowing, the appointment of the Chairman and
the General Manager, and the conditions of service of all employees. The CEB
is subject to the provisions of the 1971 Finance Act regulating the finances
of public corporations.
29.       The CEB has adequate organization and management systems designed
by international consultants, but CEB's management needs improvement. In
common with other public corporations, CEB has problems in retaining experi-
enced staff. Although CEB is able to recruit newly graduated engineers, its
salaries are not competitive to retain its engineers once they have gained
experience, hence there is an acute shortage of intermediate engineers. A
similar situation exists for trained accountants.
30.       The CEB's employees at the end of 1979 totalled 9,948, against an
authorized total of 11,098. Over the period 1975 to 1979, the number employed
increased at an average annual rate of 5%. This rate of increase is reason-
able, but the ratio of one employee to every 15 consumers is high. CEB's
employee numbers will increase following the absorption of the distribution
systems now operated by local authorities.
31.       The CEB is charged with the responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity in the country. In addition
to selling directly to consumers, CEB sells in bulk to 214 local authorities
who, in turn, retail to their consumers. This arrangement is to be discon-
tinued shortly when CEB takes over these distribution systems and retails
direct to all consumers. There are a number of privately owned generating
plants but, except for one at the CPC refinery, they are mainly for standby
purposes and generate little energy. Some local authorities in remote areas
provide part time electricity service from diesel generators.
32.       In the past, CEB has been responsible for the development of its
own generating capacity, except for the Ukuwela station on the Mahaweli Ganga,
and is at present constructing hydro stations at Bowatenne and Canyon. In the
next few years, however, the Mahaweli Development Authority (MDA) will develop
hydroelectric power stations at Victoria, Kotmale and Randenigala. The MDA is
an agency established under the Ministry of Mahaweli Development to implement
the multi-purpose Mahaweli Ganga Development Program which involves the con-
struction -of dams, hydroelectric stations and irrigation works. As each hydro
electric development is completed, it will be transferred to CEB for operation.
The CEB is currently carrying out, with assistance from consultants, a master
plan study integrating thermal and hydro power generation to provide least cost
power.



- 10 -
33.       The CEB at present has 398 MW of installed generating capacity, of
which 328 MW is in seven hydro plants and the balance in a steam turbine and
two diesel stations. The main transmission system operates at 132 kV over
549 miles, and there is an older 66 kV system of 214 miles. Subtransmission
and distribution at 33 kV extend to about 3,000 miles, and there are about
750 miles of 11 kV overhead distribution lines. In the city of Colombo the
distribution is mainly by underground cable, at 11 kV.
34.       Maintenance of CEB's generating stations has been reasonable in the
past, but there are recent signs of deterioration. Adequate systems exist for
keeping plant history and maintenance records, but in many stations these are
not kept up to date. There is no planned maintenance schedule for each station
to permit management to check easily that all items of plant are provided for
and have been duly serviced.  The distribution systems, which CEB will shortly
inherit from local authorities, have had too many consumers added to them with-
out corresponding reinforcement, and have not been well maintained. Up to
1976 system losses were recorded as less than 12%, but in 1977 losses started
to increase and are now estimated at about 16%. As a part of agreed plans to
improve CEB's management (paragraph 67), CEB will investigate system losses
and undertake a study of local management and conservation.
Access to Service
35.       In 1979, CEB was supplying about 155,000 consumers including 214
local authorities who were supplying 205,000 consumers, making a total of
about 360,000; of these about 263,000 were domestic. Electricity consumption
in 1979 was less than 90 kWh per capita. The quality of service to most of
CEB's consumers is acceptable. Further service improvements are expected
under the proposed project.
Rural Electrification
36.       The rural electrification (RE) program arises more from broad
economic and social considerations than from specific productive requirements
such as irrigation pumping. 1/ The program has already been extended to about
2,000 of Sri Lanka's 25,000 villages. By 1983, an additional 1,150 villages
will be connected under the recently approved rural electrification project
financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A further 50-60 villages per
year will be electrified using Government funds.  The CEB has arrangements to
finance house wiring and connection charges by installment payments. A load
promotion and monitoring unit will be introduced in the course of the ADB
project.
Status of Supply
37.       The CEB's existing hydro-generating stations are reliable for about
1,500 GWh per year, but in 1979 the energy requirement exceeded this by 3%.
1/   The exploitable groundwater resources of Sri Lanka are relatively
limited. However, rural electrification facilitates the development
of small industries.



- 11 -
The maximum power demand was 325 MW, compared with a firm capacity of about
300 MW, a deficit of about 8%. New stations are under construction at Bowatenne
(40 MW by end 1980), Canyon (30 MW by end 1981), and Victoria (216 MW in 1984),
but even with these additions there will not be enough power to cover the
demand until 1985 when another 210 MW of hydro will come on line at Kotmale.
To prevent shortages of energy and power from 1980 to 1985 CEB, will install
60 MW of gas turbines in 1980, and is contemplating further thermal plant
installation in 1982/83 (paragraph 32).
Electricity Consumption
38.       The consumption of electrical energy increased at an average annual
rate of 9.3% from 1961 to 1978, varying from 17.8% in 1966 to 3% in 1974.
Growth was weak from 1972 to 1977, but with the resumption of economic growth
in the last two years 1977-79 it averaged 11.4% per annum. Forecasts made by
various authorities, including those studying the Mahaweli developments and
CEB, project that growth will continue strong in the immediate future with
some tapering off after 1984. The best estimate indicates growth of about 12%
in 1980 tapering to 9% by 1989, allowing for 5% suppression of demand due to
tariff increases.
Development Program
39.       The CEB's near term generation program is dominated by the Mahaweli
multi-purpose program which, in its accelerated form, calls for the addition
to CEB's system by 1989 of six or seven hydro electric stations totalling
about 600 MW. As a result of this program, work on the Samanalawewa project,
which was to have been financed by Russia and commissioned in 1983, has been
deferred until the late 1980's. This change in planning and the unexpected
upturn in load growth in the past two years have left CEB facing a shortage
of generating capacity which will be met by the installation in 1980 of gas
turbines burning diesel fuel, and by further thermal capacity in 1982/83.
40.       Studies of the transmission system by CEB's engineers in 1979 indi-
cated that a voltage higher than 132 kV would prove economical in handling
the flows of power to be expected from Mahaweli developments in the mid-1980s.
This finding was confirmed by consultants who recommended the use of 220 kV
lines from the Victoria/Kotmale/Randenigala areas to the load centers of
Colombo, and planning for future expansion of the grid is proceeding on that
basis.
The Bank Group's Role and External Assistance
41.       Between 1954 and 1969, the Bank made four loans totalling US$58.4
million for power developments in Sri Lanka. The first three were made to
the Government and the fourth (Loan 636-CE, US$21.0 million) to the newly
established CEB. In 1969 the Bank and IDA extended US$$29.0 million (Loan
653-CE/Credit 174-CE) for a multi-purpose development on the Mahaweli. This
included the construction of the Ukuwela hydroelectric station, which is now
operated by CEB. In 1973, IDA extended a credit (Credit 372-CE) of US$6
million for the development of CEB's transmission and distribution systems.
The proposed project is the sixth lending operation by the Bank Group to the
Sri Lanka power sector, and the third to the CEB. Physical implementation



- 12 -
of the previous projects has been satisfactory. Completion reports for the
projects financed under Loan 636-CE and Credit 372-CE are under preparation.
An organizational structure and appropriate public utility management and
financial systems were developed for CEB by consultants financed under Loan
636-CE. Severe staffing difficulties in recent years and the lack of adequate
management training for senior management have prevented the full utilization
of CEB's systems. A further strengthening of CEB's management is an important
feature of the proposed project (paragraphs 67-68). The CEB has been unable
to achieve the 8% rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets since
1974 as required under Credit 372-CE because of the unwillingness of the pre-
vious Government to authorize tariff increases after April 1972.  Substantial
tariff increases were achieved in 1978 and the proposed project is designed to
further enhance CEB's financial performance (paragraph 54).
42.       The ADB has more recently provided financing for the Bowatenne and
Canyon hydro stations, and for rural electrification. The Government is
arranging bilateral financing of the Mahaweli hydro stations, from the UK for
Victoria, Sweden for Kotmale and Federal Republic of Germany for Randenigala.
The Government requested IDA's assistance in financing the transmission
facilities required to link the Victoria and Kotmale hydroelectric stations to
the grid system. These facilities are not included in the bilateral assistance
for the Mahaweli schemes. IDA assistance has also been requested for additional
thermal generation facilities to come on stream in 1982/83 (paragraph 39).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
43.       The proposed project was prepared by CEB and was appraised in
January/February 1980. The Staff Appraisal Report entitled " Sixth Power
Project, (Ceylon Electricity Board)" (No. 2905-CE dated May 12, 1980) is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in
Washington on May 5, 1980. The Government of Sri Lanka and CEB were repre-
sented by a delegation headed by Mr. James H. Lanerolle, Secretary, Ministry
of Power and Energy and Chairman, Ceylon Electricity Board. A timetable of
key events relating to the project and special conditions of the proposed
credit are given in Annex III.
Project Objectives
44.       The project is designed to increase CEB's transmission and distri-
bution facilities between 1981 and 1984 in order to meet increasing demands
for electricity from all parts of the country and all sectors of the economy,
and to strengthen CEB's managerial and commercial performance. It will permit
power from hydroelectric stations now under construction to reach consumers.
It is intended to:
(a) increase the quantity and reliability of high voltage grid
supplies transmitted to areas where load will soon exceed
present capacity;
(b) transmit high voltage grid supplies to areas where none is
available at present;



- 13 -
(c) extend and reinforce subtransmission lines so as to improve
the quality of present supplies and to provide electricity
in areas as yet unserved;
(d) provide supplies for new housing, hotels and commercial
buildings soon to be erected in the course of the redevelop-
ment of the city of Colombo; and
(e) furnish distribution lines and substations necessary to
permit consumers to be connected to the system.
Project Description
45.       The proposed project consists of the following components:
(a) 172 miles of 132 kV second circuits to be strung on exist-
ing towers to improve supplies to Ratmalana, Jaffna and
Trincomalee;
(b) 50 miles of new single circuit 132 kV line to Valachchenai;
(c) 132 kV grid substation at Valachchenai;
(d) extensions to existing 132 kV switching stations at Kolonnawa,
Ratmalana and Anuradhapura;
(e) 500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission line;
(f) two new 132 kV primary distribution substations in Colombo
with their supply cables;
(g) augmentation of existing primary distribution substations
in Colombo;
(h) extensions and alterations to the 11 kV underground cable
network in Colombo fed by these substations;
(i) 125 miles of 33 kV overhead distribution line and 250 sub-
stations;
(j)  construction and service vehicles;
(k) operational buildings and staff quarters; and
(1) engineering and management consulting services and training.
Project Implementation
46.       The CEB is responsible for the implementation of the project.  It
has carried out similar works in the past. Much of the detailed engineering
can be handled by CEB's engineers. Consultants will be appointed shortly to
design and supervise the installation of indoor primary substations in Colombo



- 14 -
as CEB staff have no previous experience in this work. Appointment of these
consultants would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 5.01(c) of
the draft Development Credit Agreement (DCA)). The cost of engineering con-
sultancy and local office and transport is estimated at US$0.4 million,
including,about 36 man-months of services at an average cost of US$8,500.
Construction is expected to be completed by March 1984.
47.       A future project, for which IDA's assistance has been requested,
comprises the 220 kV lines, substations and switching stations required to
transmit the output from the hydroelectric stations at Victoria, Kotmale and
Randenigala into the Colombo area. Detailed engineering design for this work
will be needed shortly and provision has been made under the proposed project
for the appointment of consultants for design work and preparation of tender
documents. Engineering costs are estimated at US$1.0 million. The contract
will provide for about 90 man-months of consultant services at an estimated
man-month cost of $8,500 including salaries, overhead costs, fees, inter-
national travel and subsistence.
Cost and Financing and Relending
48.       The total project cost is estimated at about US$63.3 million equiv-
alent (including taxes and duties of about US$9.9 million equivalent) with
a foreign exchange component of US$39.5 million. The estimates are based
on December 1979 prices. Price contingencies have been estimated assuming
annual inflation of 21% for 1980, 15% for 1981, 12% for 1982, and 9% there-
after for local costs; and 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982, and 7%
thereafter for foreign costs. Physical contingencies average 10% and range
from 5% for supply of certain substation equipment to 25% for trenching and
cable joining according to the nature of the item. The proposed Credit of
US$19.5 million equivalent, together with the Saudi Fund loan (US$20.0 mil-
lion equivalent), would finance the full foreign exchange cost, or about 74%
of total project cost (excluding custom duties). The local costs, amounting
to about US$23.8 million equivalent, would be funded from CEB by internal
cash generation. The proposed Credit would also finance the foreign exchange
cost of the primary and subtransmission (major part) works and related equip-
ment, consultancies and training. The Saudi Fund loan would, on a parallel
basis, finance the foreign exchange cost of a part of the subtransmission
works, the distribution works and related equipment. Satisfactory arrange-
ments for financing by the Saudi Fund would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed Credit (Section 5.01(f) of the draft DCA).
49.       The entire proceeds of the IDA Credit would be onlent to CEB at
an interest rate of 10% per annum, over a period of twenty years, including
3 years' grace, with the Government bearing the foreign exchange risk. Exe-
cution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and CEB is
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit (Section 5.01(b) of the
draft DCA).
50.       Although the average annual rate of inflation has risen sharply
since 1978, reaching 18% in 1979, it is expected to peak in 1980, and decline
to about 12% by 1982. The current inflation is largely a result of policy-
induced price adjustments in administered prices and short-term demand-supply



- 15 -
imbalances in certain sectors, most notably construction. The Sri Lankan
authorities expect production to respond positively to the price changes and
the liberalization of the economy, and together with a tight rein over govern-
ment budgetary deficits and credit expansion, to cause a slowdown in the rate
of inflation by 1981.
Procurement and Disbursements
51.       The 132 kV components of the project will be constructed under four
single responsibility contracts. These will cover the 132 kV transmission lines,
the grid substation and switching stations, the 132 kV primary distribution
substations, and the 132 kV underground cables. The remaining construction
work in the project will be performed by CEB's work force. International
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines will be employed in
the award of all major components to be financed by IDA, including both the
contracts for the high voltage lines and substations and the supply of equip-
ment and materials to be employed or erected by CEB. Vehicles, equipment and
materials estimated to cost less than US$10,000 equivalent per item may be
procured in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA.
The aggregate of such purchases would be limited to US$100,000 equivalent.
The foreign components to be financed by Saudi Fund will be procured and dis-
bursed in accordance with Saudi Fund's requirements.
52.       Disbursements from the Credit will be made as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures of contracts for: 132 kV trans-
mission lines, and 132 kV substations and switching stations,
including the changes to the 132 kV switchgear at Kolonnawa
and Kelanitissa required for Colombo distribution;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported items or
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufac-
tured items and 65% for locally procured items for equipment
and materials for the major part of the 33 kV subtransmission
lines; vehicles and tools; and
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for consultants and training.
53.       It is recommended to retroactively finance about US$350,000 for
expenditures for engineering and management consultants, incurred after May 1,
1980.
CEB's Finances
Past Performance and Present Position
54.       Under IDA Credit 372-CE (1973), CEB was required to maintain tariffs
at levels sufficient to produce from 1974, at least an 8% rate of return per
annum on currently valued net fixed assets. The CEB has satisfactorily re-
valued its fixed assets up to 1978, in accordance with an index-linked formula
agreed with IDA. The CEB's rate of return declined from 7% in 1974 to 2% in
1978. This was mainly due to the fact that the Government did not allow CEB



- 16 -
to increase its tariffs between April 1, 1972, and December 1, 1978. The
CEB's inability to increase its tariffs limited its contribution to its
investment program in recent years, although CEB's overall contribution from
1974 to 1978 was about 33% which was satisfactory. In December 1978, the new
Government allowed CEB to increase its tariffs on the average by about 80%.
As a result of these tariff increases, CEB's rate of return in 1979 improved
to about 4%. With the proposed increase of about 65% in CEB's tariff (para-
graph 62), CEB's rate of return would increase to about 7% in 1980 and 8% in
1981.
55.       The 1978 audited accounts indicate satisfactory current and
debt/equity ratios (2:1 and 19:81, respectively). A further revaluation of
fixed assets, however, is necessary in the 1979 accounts in accordance with
the movement of local indices used for this purpose.
56.       Under Credits 174-CE and 372-CE, it was agreed to transfer to CEB
all hydroelectric stations developed under the Mahaweli program. The first
of these, Ukuwela (previously known as 'Polgolla'), was commissioned in 1976
but the terms of its transfer remain to be finally resolved. During negotia-
tions the Government's proposal for the terms of the transfer were received
and are being reviewed by IDA. These terms will be finalized, subject to
agreement with IDA, before December 31, 1980 (Section 3.04(a) of the draft
DCA). The previous requirement (Credit 372-CE) to transfer future hydro-
electric stations to CEB on terms satisfactory to IDA will be repeated in
the proposed project (Section 3.02(d) of the draft DCA).
57.       The CEB's present inventory levels represent some 18 months supply.
This is excessive and is to some extent due to past difficulties in obtain-
ing foreign exchange. Inventory controls will be reviewed by management
consultants and CEB would reduce inventories to a satisfactory level by
December 31, 1982 (Section 4.07 of the draft Project Agreement (PA)). In
addition, the Government would ensure the timely availability of foreign
exchange for future purchases (Section 3.03(a) of the draft DCA).
58.       All CEB's long-term foreign exchange borrowing is arranged through
the Government, and the Government bears the foreign exchange risk. Several
loans were transferred to CEB, however, on its establishment in 1969 from the
DGEU. The liability for the foreign exchange risk on the transferred loans
was never clearly defined and CEB has sought to recover from the Government
the additional debt service arising from currency devaluations. Over the past
ten years, CEB has borne about Rs 122 million of additional debt service on
the transferred loans, which has not been reimbursed. The Government would
resolve this matter before December 31, 1980 (Section 3.04(b) of the draft
DCA). The CEB may be required to write-off the above amount against its
retained earnings. The Government would advise CEB, by December 31, 1980,
of the terms of funding to CEB during 1978 and 1979 (Section 3.04(c) of the
draft DCA). In addition, the Government would advise CEB, in advance, of
the terms of any future loans not covered by an onlending agreement.
Tariffs
59.       The CEB's tariffs remained unchanged between April 1972 and December
1978. The present average tariff (equivalent to USi2 per kWh) is low by



- 17 -
international standards and is insufficient in relation to financial rate
of return or long-term marginal costs criteria. Operating costs have hitherto
been low reflecting the almost exclusive hydro-generated energy. This position
will change significantly in the early 1980s when CEB will need to generate
considerable thermal energy until the Mahaweli hydro-generation stations are
commissioned, from late 1984 onwards. Most local authority tariffs are below
CEB's and, following takeover by CEB, retail tariffs will be fixed by law at
then current CEB levels.
60.       In December 1978, the Government approved the inclusion of a fuel
adjustment clause in CEB's tariff schedule. This was intended to reflect the
increasing cost of thermal generation based upon the price of fuel as against
the price prevailing on July 31, 1978. The higher rate will be charged to
domestic consumers on consumption in excess of 50 kWh per month and to non-
domestic consumers on units in excess of 75% of recent minimum monthly con-
sumption. Over 60% of domestic consumers use less than 50 kWh per month and
so will be unaffected. However, in FY1979, CEB was not permitted to use the
fuel adjustment clause and in FY1980 the higher rate for domestic consumption
has been limited to Rs 0.50/kWh.
61.       The CEB is making a study of long run marginal cost (LRMC) pricing
with technical assistance from the Bank. Currently, however, there is cross-
subsidization of domestic consumers, by commercial and industrial consumers,
for socio-political reasons. The CEB would, by December 31, 1980, complete
the on-going tariff study and review its tariff structure, in consultation
with the Government and IDA. The CEB would implement any agreed recommen-
dations in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to IDA (Section 4.06 of
the draft PA).
62.       In order to improve CEB's financial performance and achieve the
required 8% rate of return on average currently valued net fixed assets, CEB
will increase its tariffs by about 65% as a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Credit (Section 5.01(e) of the draft DCA). It is estimated that
an increase in the average tariff from Rs 0.30 to 0.50/kWh (about 65%) is
required in a full year to achieve this target (in FY80 such an increase from
July 1, would produce about 7% rate of return). The Government and CEB would
also ensure that the cost of fuel is recovered in full through the operation
of the fuel adjustment clause. The CEB intends to revise the fuel adjustment
clause as part of the present tariff review. The CEB would also review tariffs
annually, before the start of every financial year, to ensure that revenues
are sufficient to meet operating costs (including fuel costs) and depreciation
and to produce a rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets of at
least 8% annually (Section 4.04(a) of the draft PA).
63.       Tariffs will increase further from the present levels (average
Rs 0.30/kWh) to meet increases in operating costs, price escalation and CEB's
contribution to investment. During the project period, the average tariff/ kWh
would rise from the proposed Rs 0.50 (paragraph 62) to Rs 0.62 (1982), Rs 0.73
(1983) to Rs 0.76 on completion of the project in 1984. Thereafter, it will
rise following the commissioning of the Mahaweli hydro-electric stations to
Rs 1.17/kWh in FY1987. In real terms, this presents a doubling of tariffs from
the present level. Such tariff levels are sufficient to produce at least an 8%



- 18 -
rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets in each year and in 1982
and 1983 would produce a 10% rate of return which is required to enable CEB to
finance the local costs of its investment in those two years.
Future Finances
64.       The CEB's investment program and financing plan through 1984 is cur-
rently being reviewed. Most of the hydro-power investment in the 1980's will
be carried out under the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga Development Program with the
power assets being transferred to CEB on completion of each scheme. However,
CEB will have to provide transmission links to the proposed hydro-stations
and meet short-term power needs through 1985 by additional thermal investments.
Following completion of present studies, CEB will prepare a firm investment
program through FY1984 and will submit such a program to IDA by October/November
1980. The CEB's long-term finances through 1987 are satisfactory. The CEB
will have satisfactory current (1982 - 2.0 and 1987 - 2.4) and debt/equity
(1984 - 29/71 and 1987 - 48/52) ratios. Debt service coverage of at least
1.25 will be required (Section 4.03 of the draft PA).
Billing and Collection
65.       The CEB's billing and collection performance has been reasonably
satisfactory. It is required, under Credit 372-CE, to keep customer receiv-
ables to no more than the equivalent of three months' billings. The latest
figures, at the end of August 1979, indicated receivables equivalent to 3.6
months' billings. CEB's control of the billings of large consumers is satis-
factory. A major factor in the recent increase was the position of the local
authorities (equivalent to 5.7 months' billings) many of whose bills are unpaid
pending the takeover of their systems by CEB. The CEB's present obligation
will be repeated under the proposed credit. In addition, the Government will
ensure the payment by local authorities to CEB of all current bills, and
establish a satisfactory program to clear local authorities arrears (Section
3.03(b) of the draft DCA). Arrears will be settled as part of the transfer
arrangement but should the transfer be delayed beyond September 1980, the
Government will agree with IDA a program by October 31, 1980.
Management Systems and Accounting
66.       Comprehensive management and accounting systems were introduced by
CEB in 1974 based on recommendations of consultants, financed under Loan 636-
CE. The systems are satisfactory but staffing difficulties in recent years
have led to serious delays in preparing management, particularly financial,
reports. This has reduced management effectiveness and control.
67.       While some improvements will follow the strengthening of the account-
ing staff in 1979, present managerial problems require closer examination. The
previous consultants (paragraph 66) will be retained to review the present
position, recommend improvements and prepare management development and train-
ing programs. Their appointment will be a condition of credit effectiveness
(Section 5.01(c) of the draft DCA). The CEB will submit to IDA, in advance,
any proposal for major change to CEB's organizational structure (Section 3.03
of the draft PA). The estimated cost of the study including the possible



- 19 -
employment of management advisers to CEB is included in the proposed project.
Improved reporting to IDA was agreed during negotiations.
68.       The CEB has appointed a local firm of accountants to assist in bring-
ing accounting records up-to-date, and preparing current financial control
reports. The CEB would submit satisfactory 1979 accounts to IDA as a condition
of Credit effectiveness (Section 5.01(d) of the draft DCA).
Training
69.       Present training facilities are limited but a recent consultants'
report on artisan training, financed under the USAID program, is being
reviewed by CEB. Management training needs will be identified by management
consultants. The CEB will submit to IDA a satisfactory training program for
all cadres of staff by June 30, 1981, and will thereafter implement the
agreed program (Section 3.04 of the draft PA).
Benefits and Risks
70.       The proposed project is an integral part of the total power sector
investment program in Sri Lanka, incorporating CEB's expenditure on genera-
tion, transmission and distribution, the Mahaweli program of hydroelectric
stations, and later, the Samanalawewa hydroelectric station. It serves to
transmit the additional power generated to satisfy incremental demand at the
load centers. Its nature as a selected aggregate of individual lines and
substations does not lend itself to isolated justification: therefore, the
entire investment program, covering the proposed project implicitly, has
been justified.
71.       The minimum rate of return on the available power sector investment
program (including the complete headworks, but excluding irrigation downstream
costs and benefits) is about 3%, using tariff revenue only as a proxy for
benefits. This indicates that tariffs are well below marginal cost. The
true economic rate of return would be significantly higher, if full benefits
of incremental power supply to the economy could be quantified. It was
attempted to quantify these additional benefits by using the cost and extent
of use of alternative energy sources for economic activity and for lighting.
On this basis, the economic rate of return is likely to be between 8% and 16%,
the best estimate being 12%. Based on the overall feasibility of the invest-
ment program the project is justified as a necessary part of the program.
72.       The project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no
unusual risks and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
73.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Association, the draft Project Agree-
ment between the Association and the Ceylon Electricity Board, and the Recom-
mendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the



- 20 -
Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
74.       Special conditions of the Credit are listed in Section III of Annex
III. The following events of suspension have been added, namely: if CEB fails
to fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement (Section 4.01(a) of the
draft DCA); if the Ceylon Electricity Board Act changes in a way which would
have a material and adverse effect on the execution of the project (Section
4.01(c) of the draft DCA); and if the Saudi Fund loan (Section 4.01(e) of the
draft DCA) is suspended or prematured. Additional conditions of effectiveness
include: the appointment of engineering and management consultants (Section
5.01(c) of the draft DCA), satisfactory arrangements for financing by the
Saudi Fund (Section 5.01(f) of the draft DCA), an electricity tariff increase
of about 65% (Section 5.01(e) of the draft DCA), and CEB to submit to IDA
satisfactory accounts for FY79 (Section 5.01(d) of the draft DCA).
75.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
76.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 504 - Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The original project, as appraised in 1973, was designed to increase
milk production on about 2,400 dairy farms covering 42,000 acres in the
Coconut Triangle and Mid Country of Sri Lanka by providing credit, technical
assistance and a strengthened milk collection, transport and marketing system.
Complementary objectives were to establish pilot units for commercial calf
rearing and pasture management systems and to provide processing equipment
to the National Milk Board. However, progress was severely constrained by
the poor supply of cattle available for supplying to project borrowers. The
poor supply of cattle was due to import problems and an over-estimation of
the national herd at appraisal stemming from unreliable Government statistics.
Moreover, unrestricted slaughter of cattle was stimulated by a rapid increase
in concentrate feed prices which made milk production unattractive plus the
relatively high consumer price of fish and poultry meat. It, therefore,
became necessary to reformulate the project. Before proceeding with refor-
mulation, the Government was requested to provide appropriate incentives to
the dairy sector by raising the producer price of milk and stabilizing feed
prices. Appropriate action was taken in November, 1978, and the climate for
dairying has improved accordingly. The revised project would focus on
what was a small component of the original project -- support to dairy co-
operatives. Under this component, dairy farmers would be organized in a
manner similar to the successful Anand pattern of Dairy Cooperatives in
India. The National Dairy Development Board (India) helped in the prepa-
ration of the reformulated project. Under this reformulation, the supply
of inputs and services would become key activities which would include pro-
vision of technical assistance and credit to farmers and support for milk
collection, transport and marketing. The successful ongoing pilot calf/heifer
rearing and pasture programs have been expanded. The number of beneficiary
farm families would be substantially increased (current estimate approximately
10,000 vs. 2,400 in the original project) and the project would contribute to
a considerable increase in income of existing landless and small farmer dairy
producers.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project covers five tank areas, serving a total cultivated area
of 31,500 acres. The project includes: (a) construction works for improving
irrigation and drainage facilities; (b) improvement of farm roads; (c) provi-
sion of farm equipment for land preparation and plant protection; (d) strength-
ening of agricultural supporting services, particularly extension; and (e)
technical assistance for improving the operation and maintenance of the irri-
gation systems. The construction program continues to lag behind the revised
schedule by about one year. In August 1979 IDA approved the procurement of
about US$1.5 M of additional construction equipment under the Credit as a means
of improving construction progress and the quality of the work. The construc-
tion program for two of the tanks, Mahakandarawa and Mahawilachchiya, is fairly
well advanced; completion of the major part of this work is expected by the end
of 1980. Work is in the initial stages on the other three tanks. The quality
of project management has been a serious constraint to effective implementation.
A new management team is to be provided. Also, it has been agreed with the
Government that a three-member consulting team, funded un0pr the IDA credit
or the U.K. grant, would be provided for up to two years to assist the Irriga-
tion Department in the design and supervision of the project. IDA provided a
design engineer for about six weeks during February/March 1980 to review and
assist in the design of irrigation works to be undertaken in 1980 until the
consulting team is appointed. With these measures, project implementation
(measured both in terms of time and quality) is expected to improve signifi-
cantly. A study has been undertaken on 120 ac in the project area to train
farmers in making use of rainfall for land preparation and early cultivation,
thus conserving tank water for yala cultivation. This technical assistance
program is to improve water management and water use efficiencies in the
project area and appears to be successful. The T&V system of agricultural
extension is not yet operating effectively. However, the Secretary, Ministry
of Agriculture is taking a special interest in the program and is confident
that he can make it successful.
Cr. No. 701 - Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; US$19.0 million
of June 27, 1977; Effective Date: December 29, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The Credit will help finance construction of irrigation and drainage
schemes on 40,000 acres of new land in the Mahaweli Ganga dry zone, together
with providing O&M facilities and equipment, production support in the form
of necessary tilling power and implements, marketing, transport and processing
facilities for 71,000 acres and improved agricultural extension services for
106,000 acres. Cofinancing arrangements have been made with Canada, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States and the EEC. Considerable
progress has been achieved in the construction of the irrigation system and
the outlook for completing the project about 1-1/2 to 2 years ahead of schedule

remains good. The settlement of many areas has begun. A total of about
2,600 farms out of a total of about 13,500 had been settled by early 1980 and
settlement of all areas is scheduled for completion by late 1980. On-farm
development work has been completed for about 1,000 farms but is not keeping
pace with settlement. The completion of social infrastructure is lagging far
behind other project components but steps are being taken to accelerate this
work. Water issues were started in November 1979 in some of the recently
settled project areas and water charges have been initiated in adjoining
areas of System H completed previously (a total of about Rs 120,000 had been
collected by mid-November 1979). A feeling of optimism is prevalent among
project staff. Quality control measures and the quality of completed works
continue to improve but are still not up to desired levels. Much of the work
is only partially completed and considerable cleanup remains in areas where
construction work is essentially complete. The agricultural extension program
is adversely affected by inadequate staffing and morale and discipline of
extension staff are low. The Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, is personally
taking steps to rectify these conditions. A farmer training program (organized
in part of System H) is achieving excellent results and will be expanded over
the total area. Disbursements are still far behind schedule but are expected
to increase significantly with the approval of several requests for withdrawal
by mid-1980.
Cr. No. 709 - Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of June 30, 1977; Effective
Date:  February 8, 1978; Closing Date:  June 30, 1983
This credit will help finance improvement of existing piped water
supplies to Colombo and five adjacent towns south of Colombo. In addition,
the project will provide piped water to five adjacent towns north of Colombo
and Ambalangoda and Kalutara on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. It also
includes provision for expenditures on spare parts and equipment, technical
assistance and training. An additional credit of Canadian $5.0 million from
Canadian funds administered by IDA is assisting in financing this project.
Recently, an EEC Special Action Credit Agreement of US$7.0 million has been
signed. Actions were taken in implementing some institutional changes, intro-
ducing a new bulk water tariff, and establishing new accounting procedures
both in the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and in local authorities.
Despite initial delays, the WDB has made good progress during the past year,
particularly in procurement.
Cr. No. 742 - Fourth Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$8.0 million of September 30, 1977; Effective Date:
December 16, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This credit will meet a substantial portion of DFCC's estimated
foreign exchange requirements for lending to private sector industrial
projects and tourism. Subprojects for US$7.8 million have been authorized.

DFCC remains a competent institution, with a rapidly increasing level of
activity, which could increase further provided that DFCC's staffing problems
are overcome as well as the constraint caused by the low equity base.
Cr. No. 818 - Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project; US$21.0 million of
July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984
The credit would assist the Government in improving the economic
efficiency of the tea industry by lowering production costs and improving
tea quality in the project area, as well as in stemming the decline in tea
output. Project progress is satisfactory. Procurement is under way; all
tender documents have been issued. In the case of housing, awards have been
made and construction started. Field works, replanting and infilling, are
on schedule. All other project components, namely health component, training
component and tea area measurement, are progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 819 - Tree Crop Diversification (Tea) Project; US$4.5 million of
July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
This credit would help the Government in its initial effort in a
long-term program to rehabilitate, diversify and settle degraded mid-country
lands, mainly nationalized tea estates. The National Agricultural Development
and Settlement Authority, the project executing agency, has developed into a
mature development organization which is operating efficiently under capable
management. Despite some delay in procurement of equipment, progress in
field work is impressive. Cluster selection and homestead and farm demarca-
tion are nearly complete and soil conservation work (bench terraces, lock and
spill drains, graded stone terraces) well under way and accelerating. Foun-
dations for about 500 houses have been laid and these houses are at various
stages of construction. Implementation of settlement aspects of the project
(settler selection, transfer of non-citizen labor to other estates, and land
allocation) has just started. This is the most sensitive and potentially
difficult part of the project.
Cr. No. 891 - Kurunegala Rural Development Project; US$20.0 million of
April 26, 1979; Effective Date: August 27, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984.
The project aims to assist the development of the District of
Kurunegala in an integrated manner for purposes of raising productivity,
employment, incomes and living standards and to develop a replicable model
for rural development for other districts in Sri Lanka. The project will
provide for rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes accompanied by
improved water management practices to fully exploit the irrigation potential,
and for programs for replanting/underplanting, intercropping and fertilizing
of smallholder coconut plantations. The project will also strengthen agri-
cultural extension services, improve the supply of input services such as



- 32 -                        ANNEX II
Page 6
fertilizer distribution and seeds supplies, and lay the foundation for a
viable agriculture credit system. These directly productive investments
will be complemented by investments in transportation, health, education,
water supply and rural electrification. Subsidiary loan agreements with
participating banks have been signed and the project unit set up. A super-
vision mission reviewed the project in August, 1979 and reported good
progress.
Cr. No. 900 - Road Maintenance Project; US$16.5 million of June 22, 1979;
Effective Date: December 19, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
1984
The project aims to improve the highway system of Sri Lanka by a
program of enhanced periodic and routine maintenance. It would assist the
Government in the rehabilitation of 112 miles of road, resurfacing of 150
additional miles and strengthening, repairing or replacement of 30 bridges.
The project would also provide plant and equipment for workshops and strengthen
the road maintenance services of the Department of Highways. Consultants have
recently been appointed and started their work.
Cr. No. 931 - Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project; US$15.5
million of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 4, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The project would help Sri Lanka to (a) introduce a Training and
Visit (T&V) extension system throughout the entire country, (b) strengthen
adaptive research, and (c) improve and expand training of extension officers.
The project would establish a link between research and extension and enhance
the intensity, coverage and the content of agricultural extension services.
A unified extension system would be developed, under which extension workers
would receive biweekly training, visit farmers according to planned schedules,
and transmit extension messages.
Cr. No. 942 - Small and Medium Industries Project; US$16.0 million of
July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 23, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The principal objectives of the project would be to encourage and
assist growth and productivity improvement of small and medium firms, defined
as enterprises having plant and equipment valued at less than Rs 1 million, so
as to increase their contribution to efficient low cost employment creation,
export expansion, regional development and economic growth. The project would
have two main components - credit and technical, management and marketing
services. Under the credit component, it is proposed to establish a fund in
the National Development Bank (NDB) to provide refinancing of subloans made to
small and medium industries by commercial banks and the Development Finance
Corporation. The technical services component would be implemented by the
Industrial Development Board, Department of Small Industry, Department of

Textile Industries, and the National Institute of Management, and directed at
specific subsectors - rubber products, light engineering, subcontracting
exchanges, handlooms, coir products, and rice milling.
Cr. No. 979 - Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project; US3.0 million;
not yet effective
The project is to provide technical assistance for: (i) preparation
of a reconnaissance-level study of plans for conveying and utilizing surplus
Mahaweli Ganga water to develop land in three alternative areas in order to
select the best plan for a transbasin diversion project; (ii) ongoing review
of designs and tender documents for the Right Bank Transbasin Canal, and
preparation of final designs and tender documents for construction of civil
works and social infrastructure for part of System C in the Mahaweli Basin;
and (iii) support for other studies and designs of projects in the Mahaweli
Ganga Development Program. Training of local staff is included throughout
the project. An EEC Special Action Credit of US$2.0 million equivalent has
been provided to assist in financing consultants' services for the ongoing
review of the designs and tender documents for the Right Bank Transbasin
Canal and the preparation of final design and tender documents for System C.
Cr. No. 994 - Road Passenger Transport Project; US$53 million; not yet
effective.
The project would improve the availability and reliability of public
road passenger transportation services throughout Sri Lanka. It would intro-
duce improved maintenance standards, thereby improving fuel efficiency. It
also aims to improve the financial condition of Sri Lanka Central Transport
Board and Regional Transport Boards (RTBs), and progressively reduce and by
1983 eliminate Government subsidies for public bus operations. The project
provides for the purchase of 2,100 bus chassis, which will be assembled at
the assembly plant in Sri Lanka. It also includes improvements of bus main-
tenance facilities and practices in RTBs, traffic engineering measures to
improve bus flows on roads, and technical assistance and training for the
execution of the project and institution building.
