MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A REFORM, INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND PREINVESTMENT PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to China for SDR 35.5 million (equiva-
lent to US$50 million), on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to
help finance a Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project.
2.      Backtround.  Since 1980, the fundamental objective of the Bank's
country assistance strategy in China has been to provide analytical and
material support to the country's economic reform and modernization process.
The latter, advancing through pragmatic, results-oriented experimentation and
diffusion that has proved well suited to China's specific conditions, has
helped to integrate its economy with the rest of the world; and, within China,
the Bank's international perspective has made important contributions to the
design and implementation of the country's development efforts. In this
context, and complementing lending and economic and sector work, technical
assistance and training have been, directly and indirectly, an important
element of the Bank's assistance strategy. Initially, transfer of technology,
mainly through preinvestment, project preparation and related training
activities, was the principal focus of the Bank's technical assistance effort.
Later, during the second half of the 1980s, this focus was broadened and
deepened to include policy advice and Institutional development in China's key
economic management and sectoral agencies. Following a difficult three-year
period (1988-91) during which the authorities' preoccupation with macroeconom-
ic stabilization caused a slow-down in reform efforts, the past year has
vitnessed a revival in reform initiatives on several fronts. This renewed
impetus, and the Government's conviction that only further reforms can solve
the fundamental issues facing the economy, has increased the demand for
technical assistance for policy advice, institutional development support and
preinvestment.
3.      To date, two Technical Cooperation Credits (Credits 1412-CHA and
1664-CMA) have financed technical assistance mainly related to project
preparation. The first has been completed and a Project Completion Report
(PCR) was issued on June 6, 1989. The second, while still under implementa-
tion, has been substantially committed. Together, the two credits totalling
$30 million helped finance the preparation of about 60 investment projects for
subsequent Bank/IDA financing. In 1987, a Planning Support and Special
Studies Project (Credit 1835-CMA) provided $20.7 million to finance planning
studies as inputs to China's Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), special studies
of an inter-sectoral or innovative nature, and institutional development
support activities including in-service education and training for the central
government agencies responsible for economic policy analysis and formulation
and the implementation of economic, financial and industrial reforms. This
project is proceeding satisfactorily, albeit somewhat slowly, owing to the
coordinating agency's initial lack of experience and to protracted government
procedures for approval of subprojects when the project was launched. A
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, approved by the Executive



Directors on September 29, 1992, is designed to strengthen, inter alia, the
accounting, policy and research, regulatory and supervisory functions of
China's central bank and, indirectly, to support the development of ite key
banking and financial institutions. Finally, a free-standing environment
technical assistance projeat is currently under preparation. Overall, IDA's
involvement in, and support for these diverse technical assistance activities
in China has been effective, albeit with some variation in the impact of
individual subprojects under the Planning Support and Special Studies Project.
4.      The Bank's mandate in China, as in all borrowing countries, is to
support broad-based economic development and to combat poverty. First, its
country assistance program seeks to balance the needs for help with policy
advice and institutional reform, technological modernization, physical and
social infrastructure development, environmental protection and poverty
alleviation. This requires a comprehensive policy dialogue at the national
level, buttressed by a large program of economic and sector work. Second, it
entails direct support to key economic agencies aimed at further enhancing
their capability to undertake policy analysis and later to set in motion the
principal reform measures. Third, it also includes a very substantial program
of Bank/IDA lending, characterized by a multisectoral and increasingly robust
reform content. The proposed project would make a significant contribution to
this overall effort, through institutional support to the key agencies
responsible for China's reform efforts and through preinvestment assistance
for the country's economic development plan.
5.      Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations. Experience under the
three earlier projects noted above has suggested at least three important
criteria for effective implementation of technical assistance activities in
China, as follows: (a) detailed preparation and design of individual
subprojects; (b) appropriate mechanisms and processes for periodic monitoring
of subproject execution; and (c) flexible, but systematic overall project
coordination and management. These criteria, and other lessons learned from
these earlier projects, have been taken into account in the design and
preparation of the proposed project. For example, unlike the Planning Support
and Special Studies Project, the reform and institutional support component
includes seven fully prepared and already appraised subprojects that have been
reviewed by IDA staff and are essentially ready for immediate implementation.
In addition, performance indicators have been developed for each subproject to
facilitate monitoring of implementation, and the project's overall progress
would be subject to a formal annual review by the Government and IDA jointly.
Finally, the MOP's Technical Assistance and Training Division (TATD), estab-
lished in 1988, would be responsible for overall project coordination and
management, for the supervision of individual subprojects, and for the
processing of subprojects still to be approved during project execution, in
consultation with IDA.
6.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The rationale for IDA involvement in
the proposed project is three-fold. First, the project's reform ^4d institu-
tional support component, a direct response to the Government's r-ently
reinvigorated and accelerated reform drive, is one that IDA, as an indepen-
dent, international development agency, is uniquely qualified to support.
IDA's involvement would bring its own, and other relevant international



- 3 -
experience to bear on the complex reform measures and institutional develop-
ment support activities that China has recently initiated; it would also
complement and reinforce other elements of its country assistance strategy in
China. Second, IDA's involvement in the project's preinvestment and project
preparation component is justified by the scope, size and complexity of
China's iavestment program and its demand for external capital, incl4ding
increased borrowing from the Bank during the next few years. In this connec-
tion, while the engineering quality of preinvestment and project feasibility
studies prepared by local consultants and design institutes has improved in
recent years, their selection of appropriate technology and appraisal of
economic, financial and institutional options often requires substantial
strengthening. Consequently, the experience of internationally-recruited
consultants is often still needed to ensure optimal project design and scope.
Third, while UNDP (around US$40 million a year), the Japanese Grant Facility
(roughly US$10 million annually), and bilateral donors provide grant financing
for preinvestment work in China (including the preparation of projects for
Bank/IDA financing), the amount and flexibility of funds available from these
sources vary and, in the case of bilateral grants, are often earmarked for
specific sectors and purposes. Thus, IDA involvement in the preinvestment
component of the proposed project is needed to ensure a certain and flexible
means of financing for project preparation, when other sources are unavail-
able.
7.      Obiectives.  Against this background, the proposed project would
support China's overall economic reform and modernization effort and help to
strengthen selected key institutions responsible for policy and research,
training and implementation. It would also help prepare selected public
investments and projects, in particular those potentially suitable for
external, including Bank/IDA, financing.
8.      Proiect DescriDtion.  The proposed project has two components.  The
first, for reform and institutional develooment support, with an estimated
cost of about $27 million, would comprise approximately 10-12 discrete
subprojects to be executed by selected institutions involved in policy and
research, training, implementation and other activities related to China's
economic reform program. About $13 million allocated to this component would
be committed for subprojects already prepared, appraised and approved by IDA
for the following seven agencies: (a) the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), to
stren8then professional capability for economic and statistical analysis; (b)
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), to improve their capability to
undertake quantitative analysis of the economy; (c) the System Reform Comiis-
sion (SRC), to support its program of studies and research, including enter-
prise reform; (d) the State Tax Bureau (STB), to strengthen its capacity to
formulate and implement tax policy; (e) the Ministry of Materials and Equip-
ment (MME), to support its program of reform of the distribution system for
major goods; (f) the Ministry of Finance, to carry out China's program of
economic and sector analysis in support of the economic reform program; and
(g) training networks in health and transport (as specified in para. 23 of the
attached Technical Annex), to increase training outreach and better meet the
unmet demand for training. The remaining $14 million allocated to this compo-
nent, would be committed later under subproject preparation, appraisal and
approval procedures acceptable to IDA confirmed at negotiations. The attached



- 4 -
Technical Annex describes this component's, and the overall project's,
institutional context and detailed features, and procurement, disbursement and
management arrargements.
9.      The second component, for greinvestment and iroiect iregargtion, with
an estimated cost of $33 million, would be similar in design, purpose, and
scope to the two previous Technical Cooperation Credits (Credits 1412-CRA and
1664-CRA). As such, it would consist of a line of credit available to finance
feasibility studies, preinvestment and other technical assistance needed to
prepare projects for external, specifically BankJIDA, financing.  In certain
exceptional circumstances, it could also be used to finance technical assis-
tance activities related to project implementation--including, for example,
the national components of provincially-based and funded investment projects--
as well as selected project-related studies. Preinvestment and project
preparation subprojects under this component would be approved on a case-by-
case basis in accordance with agreed criteria and procedures acceptable to
IDA. An illustrative list of subprojects, of which several are at an advanced
stage of preparation, is included in the Technical Annex.
10.     Proiect Implementation.  Implementation of the proposed project would
be managed and coordinated by the Ministry of Finance. The project cost is
estimated at US$60 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$46.5 million equivalent (77.51). The total financing required is US$60
million, of which the Association would finance US$50 million (1002 of the
foreign exchange and 831 of the total). Retroactive financing of up to US$3
million for expenditures incurred after November 15, 1992 will be provided in
respect of consultants' services and training in subprojects under the
preinvestment and project preparation component. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
11.     Asreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the
followings (a) criteria for subproject selection, processing and approval (for
the reform component, those with the objective of strengthening departments
and agencies involved in the reform program, and for the investment support,
those for the preparation of feasibility studies of proj-:ts to be financed by
IBRD or IDA and in exceptional cases, for their implementation); (b) terms and
conditions at which credit proceeds are to be made available to the beneficia-
ry agencies for subprojects; and (c) project coordination, management and
supervision arrangements. In addition, an understanding was reached on the
content and size of seven subprojects under the reform and institutional
development support component. The project is expected to be completed by
December 31, 1997, with a closing date of June 30, 1998.
12.     Benefits and Risks. The project's principal benefits would be to
reinforce the Government's overall economic reform process, to strengthen the
key institutions involved, and to finance the preparation of sound investment
projects for financing by the Bank/IlDA and, as appropriate, other external
sources. Given the satisfactory experience under two earlier Technical
Cooperation Credits, there are no special risks to implementation of the



-5-
project's preinvestment component. Similarly, the advanced preparation of,
and prior agreement on seven subprojects minimize the potential risk of a
delay in the initial implementation of its reform and institutional support
component.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

CHINA - REFORM. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND PREINVESTMENT PROJECT
Technical Annex
1.      Overvi  .  Addressing the Bank's objectives in China to support
broad-based economic development and to combat poverty requires a vigorous
dialogue at the national level, supported by a substantial program of economic
and sector work. It also requires direct support to key core agencies to
strengthen their capacity to carry out the analysis and later to implement
major reform measures. Finally, it requires a substantial program of Bank
lending with a strong reform content. Through its support to key core
agencies involved in the reform program and of the elements of China's invest-
ment program proposed for Bank Group assistance, the present project would be
an important element of this program.
2.      Proiect Objectives.  The project has two principal objectives.  The
first is to support the Government's program of reform, and related institu-
tional strengthening. The second is to support the Government's investment
program. Specifically, the project would: (a) support reform-supportive
studies and economic research, (b) help strengthen selected core agencies
responsible for macroeconomic management, (c) support local training institu-
tions, including some of those working with Economic Development Institute
(EDI), and (d) provide an assured and flexible source of financing for
technical assistance for preparation of projects expected to be financed by
the Bank and IDA, and in selected cases for their implementation.
3.      Proiect Descrin1tion.  The proposed project has two components.  The
project's reform and institutional develooment comoonent, with an estimated
cost of US$26.6 million, consists of subprojects for key core agencies
involved in the reform program. These include the State Statistical Bureau
(to strengthen its national accounting system and analysis capability) and the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (to improve its economic analysis and
forecasting). The System Reform Commission (SRC) would receive support to
carry out several studies. The State Tax Bureau would be strengthened to give
it an expanded capacity to formulate and implement tax policy. Assistance
would be provided to the Ministry of Materials and Equipment to support its
program of reform of the production distribution system for major goods
(including steel, timber, cement, ferrous metals and vehicles). The project
would also include support for the Ministry of Finance to carry out China's
program of economic and sector analysis in support of the economic reform
program. Support for training networks in transport and health would also be
provided under the project. These networks have cooperative arrangements with
EDI, which would supervise this component.
4.      Agreement has been reached with the Government on a core list of
seven subprojects under the project's reform and institutional development
component. Paragraphs 6 to 24 describe each subproject included in the core
program. Funding has also been reserved under this component for financing of
additional subprojects as required for approval on a case-by-case basis during
project implementation. The following subprojects are under consideration for
financings legal reform, the Ministry of Communication's institutional



development program, training networks for agriculture and finance, management
of technical assistance, and capital market development training.
S.      The project's greinveatment and pgroject Dremaration comoonent, with
an estimated cost of US$33.4 million, would provide a readily available source
of funding for feasibility studies of projects for which Bank or IDA financing
is being sought and in appropriate circumstances their implementation,
including national components and selected project-related studies. The
investment support component would be a line of credit for subprojects to be
app.roved on a case-by-case basis. Subprojects wlll be selected according to
agreed criteria set forth as follows; (a) preparation of feasibility studies
of projects to be financed by the Bank or the Association, (b) selected
project related studies, and (c) in exceptional cases, the implementation of
such projects. In general, such subprojects would prepare feasibility studies
for projects to be financed by IBRD or IDA. An illustrative list of
subprojects derived from the IBRD/IDA lending program is given in Attachment I
to this Technical Annex. In keeping with past practice in China, where grant
funding for feasibility studies is readily available and suitable, such
funding would be used rather than IDA credit proceeds.
Reform and Institutional Suioort
6.      State Statistical Bureau.  As part of China's reform program to
establish a more market oriented economic system, the statistical framework is
being strengthened to permit timely and accurate information and analysis for
economic policy-making. To this end, the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) is
committed to making the transition from the former national accounting system
(based on the Material Product System) to the internationally accepted System
of National Accounts (SNA) developed by the United Nations. There is also a
need to upgrade basic data collection approaches, e.g., use of sample surveys,
classifications, and imputation methods. Simultaneously, efforts are being
made to build capacity for macroeconomic analysis of economic changes and
trends that could provide a more rational basis for policy formulation.
7.      The SSB subproject supports these efforts to strengthen professional
and technical capability for economic and statistical analysis. Its specific
objectives are to: (a) introduce national accounts based on the SNA framework;
(b) develop economic statistics based on business and enterprise surveys using
sampling techniques, both for use in national accounting work and for monitor-
ing of economic trends; (c) study international comparisons based on purchas-
lng power parities and compilation of appropriate price indices; (d) strength-
en SSB's training programsl and (e) use economic data in an analytical
context.
8.      The 8SB subproject (US$1.1 million, of which US$0.7 million foreign
and US$0.4 million local)l/ consists of five elements: national accounts,
economic statistics, international price comparison, review of training, and
economic analysis. The program places emphasis on training. Approximately
XJ 40% advisory, 30% long-term overseas training, 20% local training and 10%

400 statistical personnel will participate in 12 in-country seminars and
workshops on national accounts, economic statistics and indicators, and price
statistics. In addition, 36 SSB staff will receive external training on
national accounts and economic statistics through courses regularly provided
by established universities and statistical institutes. SSB's current
training program will also be reviewed in order for 8SB to prepare a
comprehensive report on China's statistical training needs for the next
decade. Aside from training, the program will fund a number of short-term
external consultants who would advise SSB on national accounts statistical
tasks, developing economic statistics and indicators, and designing and
preparing for an international comparative price exercise. The subproject
would also fund purchase of equipment (desktop computers, software, audio-
visual aids for training) which are essential for the above proposed
activities.
9.      SSB is also the recipient of funds from the Asian Development Bank
(US$130,000 in grants in 1991), principally for overseas fellowships. Sub-
project components would be closely coordinated with ADD funding to avoid
overlapping and ensure balance.
10.     Chilese Acviemv of Social Sciences.  The Institute of Quantitative
and Technical Economics (IQTE) of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS) initiated, in 1990, a project entitled "Economic Analysis and
Forecasting for China". The project would, through the construction and use
of a short-term macroeconomic model, produce annual and biennial forecasts and
analysis to be used by the State Council (China's "cabinet"), and organize
seminars and symposia to publicize and discuss these findings. CASS is well
placed to take on this role: it is the first research institute in China to
combine quantitative methods with qualitative analysis of economic problems.
it has a long and close cooperative relationship with the SSB, as well as with
international research institutions.
11.     The CASS subproject would extend CASS's capability in undertaking the
above activities. The specific objectives of the subproject are to:
(a) provide the Government a quantitative basis for policy making in the
short-term; (b) disseminate, to the Chinese public and overseas audiences,
forecasts and analytical reports on the Chinese economy; and (c) strengthen
IQTE's capability to undertake theoretical and quantitative analysis of the
economy.
12.     The CASS subproject (US$825,000, of which US$620,000 foreign and
US$205,000 local)2/ consists of short-term overseas training for selected
staff in the establishment and maintenance of data banks, operation and
maintenance of computers and software, economic modelling, and analytical
methods in economics, as well as short overseas visits by IQTE staff and
officials of relevant government departments to learn from the experiences of
other countries. Staff exchanges with international organizations and foreign
government agencies and research institutes are also envisaged. The subpro-
21  20% advisory, 24% overseas training, 24% local training, and 27%
equipment.

ject would also fund the establishment of a data bank consisting of annual,
quarterly and monthly statistics to support IQTZ's modelling and other
quantitative work, including desktop computers and relevant software. Funds
would additionally be provided for preparation, publication and dissemination
of research papers, reports and books, as well as training materials.
13.     State Tax Bureau.  Tax reform has figured prominently in China's
reforms. Entities, including state-owned enterprises, which were tax-exempt
in the past have been brought into the tax net. Value added taxation has been
introduced for many products. Direct taxation of individuals has been
expanded, though its coverage remains limited. New regulations governing the
taxation of foreign entities have also been instituted. These and other
measures have produced a more rational tax system with broader base coverage.
However, despite these changes, China continues to have a revenue system
rather than a tax system, and a system bound by contracts rather than by
transparent rules. The system will need dramatic overhaul if it is to be
consistent with a more market-oriented economic system. Actions required
includes (a) separation of corporate taxation from profit distribution
(currently both are included in contracts at both the enterprise and provin-
cial level); (b) diversification of the tax system from its current base in
the state production enterprise system towards greater reliance on personal
income tax and final sales point taxes; and (c) replacement of the current
indirect tax system by a more transparent, rules-based system, such as a
broader range of value-added taxes.
14.     The State Tax Bureau (STB), which reports directly to the State
Council, is responsible for the drafting of new tax laws to support China's
reform program. These laws relate to corporate and personal income taxation
as well as the turnover tax. In addition, the STB, as the government agency
responsible for setting tax policy, carries out impact analysis of new changes
to the tax code. Improving tax administration is also a priority for the STB.
15.     The STB subproject (US$4.1 million, of which US$3.2 million foreign
and US$0.9 million local);/ would address these priorities. It consists of
three major components. The first is information collection. The subproject
will collect a detailed data set on enterprises, randomly drawn and stratified
by region and enterprise type. It will then establish on a pilot basis an on-
going system for the collection and transmission of data on taxpayers and tax
offices. The second is policy analysis. The information collected in the
subproject will allow a detailed quantitative examination both of the current
Chinese tax system and of alternative reforms to this tax system. The
analysis will focus on enterprise income tax and indirect taxes, addressing
the legal status, tax collection procedures, effects of taxes and reform
options for each. The analysis will be performed by foreign tax experts with
Chinese staff. Specific issues that will be considered include the unifica-
tion of the current enterprise income taxes, the elimination of the contract
system, a broadening of the VAT base, the replacement of the excise taxes on
specific commodities, and changes in the bases and the tax rate structures of
the taxes. The third component is institutional strengthening. Acquisition
,.f 30% advisory; 25% overseas training; 18% local training; 27% equipment.



of computers for training institutions, pilot tax offices, and the management
information system will improve the long-run capabilities of the tax adminis-
tration. Under this component, an extensive training on computer use, tax
policy analysis and tax administration will be provided. This subproject
would be closely coordinated with an on-going UNDP-funded project for STB, and
with the IMF'e program of cooperation with China.
16.     System Reform Commission.  The State Commission for Restructuring the
Economic System (SRC) is responsible to the State Council for the design and
monitoring of the overall economic reform program. For the coming period, its
priority areas for deeper analysis and experimentation are related to reform
of China's State-Owned Enterprises, and to the deepening of reform in the
financial sector.
17.     The SRC subproject (US$1.6 million, of which US$0.9 million foreign
*         and US$0.7 million local)4/ supports SRC's program of studies and research.
Priority areas proposed for support under the project include: (a) reform of
enterprise management practices, focusing on issues related to joint stock
enterprises and mergers; (b) securities market regulation; (c) international
competitiveness of enterprises; (d) futures markets; (e) social security
system reform, focusing on medicare reform program; and (f) the role of the
state and specialized (state-owned) banks in credit allocation. For each area
of research, study teams of both Chinese and fore&gn researchers, would
examine major issues, organize discussions of findings in seminars to which
other foreign experts would be invited, to be followed by publication and
dissemination. A lead advisor would be appointed for each area of research.
For some research areas, brief study tours to provide cross-country
perspectives would also be undertaken. A set of policy recommendations would
be the final, and most critical, outcome of each research exercise. The
research would be undertaken collaboratively with other relevant Chinese
government agencies and institutes.
18.     Ministry of Materials and Ecuimment.  The Ministry of Materials and
Equipment (NMM) is responsible for the nationwide planning and management of
the distribution of production resources. Besides managing local administra-
tive bodies and enterprises, WMN operates a network of large material distri-
bution enterprises. By the end of 1991, this "material circulation system"
consisted of 21,000 state owned enterprises, 44,000 marketing outlets, had
fixed assets worth Y15.1 billion and employed 1.1 million workers.
19.     Reforms to progressively open the country to market forces inevitably
require simultaneous reforms to this material circulation system.  To date,
the latter include: reduction in the volume of the trade in productive
materials controlled by the above state enterprises; ending the monopoly of
*         state enterprises controlling the circulation system and promoting competing
enterprises, both public and private; and integration of material, commerce
and trade sectors through the formation of new companies or through an
expanded mandate for existing enterprises at the national and local levels.
While these measures represent significant steps forward, much more needs to
I/ 10% advisory; 40% overseas training; 40% local training; 10% equipment.



be achieved if greater efficiency of distribution and production is to be
achieved.
20.     The MME subproject (US$1.3 million, of which US$1.1 million foreign
and US$0.2 million local)j/ would examine the current statuo of market
integration and methods of distribution, and identify actions which would
support the twin aims of removing internal trade barriers and developing new
distribution systems. Under the subproject, three groups of studies will be
undertaken. The first would assess the progress of the Chinese economy in the
decentralization of ito distribution systems and then suggest measures to
further promote efficient decentralization. The study would be undertaken by
staff of OME in collaboration with other Chinese institutions. The second
study examines the new, and in some cases experimental, systems of
distribution which have been introduced for particular products and locations
in China. This study will consist of several cise studies of new Pilot
Distribution Centers and a study on the experience of other countries. Case
studies will be conducted by a team of MME staff while the experience of other
countries will be studied by foreign consultants. The third study looks at
new commodities exchanges and commodity trade information systems. China has
recently established trading centers in Shanghai and Shenzhen for metals and
there are plans for establishing a multi product market for producer goods in
Beijing. In view of these experiments, it is essential to examine the
principles and prerequisites for the establishment of commodities trading
centers and to draw up the basic rules and regulations for their operation.
The question of the feasibility or desirability of multiple trading oenters
also has to be explored. The study will be conducted by international experts
and MMH officials.
21.     Economic and Sector Work. The Ministry of Finance collaborates with
the World Bank in carrying out a program of economic and sector work. The
purpose ot this subproject is to support an increasingly substantive role for
collaborating agencies in the Chinese government in carrying out this program.
The subproject will cover the costs of, for example, hiring local consultants,
conducting sample surveys, disseminating study results through publications,
and arranging follow-up seminars and similar activities, and other incremental
costs of Chinese agencies, in order to increase their ability both to
participate fully in such studies, and also improve the impact of such
analyses. The Ministry of Finance, which coordinates the economic and sector
work program, will manage this subproject through a series of grants to
individual agencies responsible for such studies. These studies will range
across the spectrum of reform and development issues in China, ane at least 25
such studies are expected to be supported by this subproject over the 1993-6
period.
22.       Training Networks In Health and Transport.  In collaboration with
the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank, Chinese ministries,
including Agriculture, Communications, Finance, and Public Health, have, over
the last decade through their respective training institutes, provided
training in key areas in each of these sectors. The need to increase training

outreach, and hence better meet the considerable unmet demand for training on
the one hand, and to strengthen training institutions on the other, has led to
the formation of networks of training institutions in each sector. Each
network has a lead institution that functions as a focal point for a group of
training institutions in a se'otor, coordinating training activities,
facilitating inter-institution ataff exchanges and establishing linkages with
international agencies, and promoting collaborative research and its
dissemination. A summary of the training networks in the above sectors is
given in Table A.1.

23.       The subproject (US$3.8 million, of which US$1.9 million foreign and
US$1.9 million local)fi/ would fund institutional development training
activities by network institutions, and research and training material
development of two training networks, namely health and transport. Two
networks are in the process of preparing their proposals. Funds for
J/ 27% advisory; 25% overseas trainingi 35% local training; 10% equipment.

institutional development would go to the organization of annual coordina-
tion/roundtable meetings, visits by foreign experts to provide technical
assistance and advice on the organizational set up as well as modalities of
training and a number of training of trainers activities. The subproject
would also fund in-country training activities for participants from both
central government and local authorities, as well as a small number of
overseas fellowships for staff of network training institutes. Funds are also
to be allocated for the development and dissemination of training materials
and research findings, and purchase of essential training equipment, such as
slide and overhead projectors, copying machines, and desk-top computers.
Proiect Administration and Imolementation
24.       Proiect Cost and Disbursement Profile.  The total project cost is
estimated at US$60.0 million. The foreign cost is an estimated US$46.5
million. The local cost is expected to be Y74 million (US$13.5 million), not
including taxes and duties, from which the project, related imports and
overseas consultants' fees and remuneration are exempt. The project cost is
based on recent experience with other free-standing technical assistance
projects in China.  The pror sed credit allocation for the investment support
component is based on an eicimate of the technical assistance requirements for
project preparation d&iring FY94-97, and for other institutional development
and technical assistance requirements in support of the Bank/IDA program in
China which are not financed from the proceeds of loans and credits. Based on
experience with earlier projects, it is estimated that 35-40 subprojects or
activities would be financed from the project. Disbursement estimates
(Memorandum and Recommendation of the President Schedule B) are based on
standard IDA profiles for technical assistance projects, slightly adjusted to
take account of the state of preparation, the fact that seven core subprojects
under the project's reform and institutional development components have been
fully prepared and appraised, and the fact that the Second Technical
Cooperation Project is expected to be fully committed by the time the proposed
credit becomes effective.
25.       Financina Plan.  The project would be financed by a Development
Credit of SDR 35.5 million (US$50 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity. The IDA Credit would finance the cost of foreign and
local consultants, in-country and overseas training, equipment as required for
the carrying out of each subproject. The Government would provide local
financing of Y55 million, amounting to approximately 17% of project costs and
equivalent to about US$10 million. The Government will allocate IDA Credit
funds for subprojects on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
26.       Implementation and Administrative Arranoements.  The Technical
Assistance and Training Division (TATD) of the World Bank Department, Ministry
of Finance would be responsible for overall project coordination and monitor-
ing of project implementation. At credit effectiveness, the seven appraised
and agreed subprojects for State Tax Bureau, State Statistical Bureau, MOF,
MMW, CASS, SRC, the health, and transport training networks, totalling about
US$13 million would be approved and credit proceeds allocated to them. TATD
would be responsible for subproject processing for those subprojects approved

later, during project implementation. Before considering subprojects for
project preparation, MO0 would verify with the State Planning Commission the
priority of the proposed follow-up investment project. It would also deter-
mine that no UNDP or other suitable grant funds were readily available for the
purpose before submitting the subproject for approval by IDA. Using formal
procedural guidelines prepared under the Planning support and Special Studies
Credit (1835-CHA) and issued by MO0 and SPC in early 1991, MO0 would ensure
effective coordination among the departments and agencies involved in
subproject implementation and monitoring of the project's substantive and
financial performance. MO0 would appoint a suitably-qualifled project coordi-
nator and would ensure that the coordinator served until the Closing Date,
with the assistance of other competent MO staff as required.
27.       Line ministries and other agencies would present requests for
financing to MOF in a standard format acceptable to IDA.  These requests would
in many cases result from discussion with llne ministry or other agency staff
during project preparation missions by Bank staff. NO0 would review proposals
on a case-by-case basis and proposals supported by MOP would be forwarded to
IDA for approval.   The line ministry or agency would handle all technical
aspects of the subprojects and would contract consultants, arrange study tours
and other training and procure equiypment. MO4 woui'  provide assistance as
needed to subproject entities and would maintain records on the status of each
subproject. The Government would maintain procedures satisfactory to IDA for
supervising the work of consultants and reviewing their reports and
recommendations. IDA could terminate withdrawals for a particular subproject
in cases of delays exceeding six months in the effectiveness of contracts for
consultants.
28.       Procurement and Disbursements.  Consultant services to be financed
from the proposed credit would be obtained in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Equipment to be financed from the
credit would be limited and the cost of most individual items is expected to
be small. Procurement of items and groups of items estimated to cost
US$200,000 or more for each contract (if any) would be through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. Domestic
manufacturers would receive a preference of 15% or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is less, in bid evaluation. Items and groups of items
estimated to cost lses than US$200,000 for each contract will be procured
through local competitive bidding. Those estimated to cost less than $100,000
for each contract and not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$3 million may be
procured on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified suppliers.
Proprietary items may be procured through direct purchase in accordance with
procedures acceptable to IDA. Prior review by IDA would be required for
equipment contracts estimated to be US$200,000 or more.
29.       It is estimated that about 53% of the credit would finance
consultant services, about 24% would finance in-country and overseas training
and 23%, equipment. IDA would finance: 100% of expenditures for consultant
services; 100% of expenditures for overseas study tours and other training;
and, for equipment, 100% of foreign expenditures for direct imports, 100% of
local ex-factory costs for locally manufactured items and 75% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally. In order to enable urgent work



- 10 -
to be carried out on three proposed subprojects expected to be financed under
the preinvestment and project preparatlon component of the project,
retroactive financing up to $3 million will be provided. This financing will
apply to consultantl' services and training expenditures incurred under these
subprojects after November 15, 1992. To facilitate disbursement, a Special
Account to be maintained in US dollars with an authorized allocation of
US$4.0 million would be established in a commercial bank satisfactory to IDA.
This amount was agreed on the basis of the advanced state of preparation of
the project, and an estimated rate of disbursement of approximately $1 million
per month from the beginning of the project implementation period.
Replenishment of the Special Account would be made monthly or whenever amounts
witkdrawn are equal to 50% of the inltlal deposlt, whichever occurs flrst.
For expenditures relatlng to training, overseas study tours and contracts for
goods, each valued less than US$200,000 equivalent, reimbursements would be
made on the basis of statements of expendltures (SOEs). Documentr supporting
the SOEs would be retained at MOP and made available for review by IDA
supervision missions.
30.       Account and Audit Arrancements.  The project accounts and the IDA
Special Account would be maintained by the Technical Assistance and Trainlng
Division, MOV. The project accounts, including the Special Account and
documentation for SOBs, would be subject to an annual audlt by the Audit
Administration of China or an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The audit
report, includlng a separate opinion on SOE used as a basis for disbursemens,
would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the Governments's
fiscal year.
31.       Monitoring and Proaress Recortina.  NOr would be responsible for
monitoring the project and would collect, review and evaluate information
regarding indlvldual subprojects. Subproject implementlng agencies would
monitor progress of their individual sibprojects, and MOP would prepare seml-
annual reports to IDA summarizing the project's substantive and financial
progress, and ldentifying subproject implementation problems and solutions. A
table of monitorable performance indicators is a part of each subproject under
the project's reform and institutional development components. consiatent
with practice under the Planning Support and Special Studies Credit, an annual
review of project implementation would be undertaken by the Government and
IDA. MOP would be responsible for screening new proposals from potential
beneficiaries before onward transmittal to IDA.
32.       Protect Launch and Subervision Arranoement. The approach to
supervision of the proposed project takes lnto account the experience of
similar and on-going projects. Overall progress of the project, and its
administrative, financial and procurement activities, would be monltored by
NOP and followed by a task manager in China and Mongolia Country Operations
Division. Reform and institutional support subprojects would be followed by
Bank staff, generally economists, specialized in the subproject's topic (e.g.,
statistics, enterprise management), as part of the Bank/IDA ESW policy
dialogue, with support when needed from staff from Asia Technical Department's
Instltutional Development Unit or institutional development consultants (e.g.
in the finallzed deslgn of the MOC subproject, para. 24). NDI staff would
supervise the training network subprojects. Project implementation support
subprojects (generally for project preparation) would be prepared by the

Chinese implementing agency with the help of the Bank's task manager for the
proposed project.
