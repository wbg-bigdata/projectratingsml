MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
FOR TlHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for SDR 4.7 million,
the equivalent of about US$7.2 million, on standard IDA terms with a ,maturity of 40
years, to help finance capacity building for the development of the private sector.
2.    Background. From 1986 to 1991, the Government of Mauritania (GOM) carried out a
number of important structural adjustment reforms. As a result, the private sector rapidly replaced
the public sector in land development, agricultural production and marketing activities. IDA
supported the Mauritanian adjustment program with a SAC (Credit Cr. 1812-MAU) and two
SECALs (Credits 2093 -MAU and 2166-MAU) covering the Agricultural and Public Enterprise
Sectors. A range of adjustment reforms were undertaken including trade liberalization,
privatization, labor market, foreign exchange system and banking reforms. In 1990, 1991 and part
of 1992, however, the economy experienced a series of exogenous shocks which had an adverse
impact on the economic and financial situation of the country.
3.    Since October 1992, the GOM agreed to implement a number of measures to
achieve long-term macroeconomic stability in the context of the Fourth Policy Framework
Paper (PFP), including devaluing the ouguiya by 27 percent. This was accompanied by
far-reaching reforms which improved the climate for private sector activities. However,
the prospect for improved performance in the private sector in general, and in the
financial, fishing and mining sectors in particular, will depend on additional reforms that
the GOM is determined to carry out. There exist several pre-investment and post-
investment obstacles to the development of the private sector in Mauritania; examples
are: (a) the lack of a formal structure for foreign or domestic private facilitation or
promotion in the country; (b) slow and overly cumbersome approval procedures for
investment incentives, averaging 18 to 24 months; (c) limited access to foreign exchange;
and (d) high taxes. The legal and regulatory framework for business, which was inherited
from the colonial times, is inadequate for the development of private business. Commercial
banks are reluctant to sue their delinquent debtors because of an inefficient judiciary
system. Commercial contracts are rarely enforced. The investment code has put too much
emphasis on the protection of local enterprises against foreign competition to the extent
that the creation of new enterprises is being discouraged. There are no clear bankruptcy
procedures. The customs system which was developed with IMF technical assistance
remains only partially implemented. The Chamber of Commerce is inefficient and does not
filly play its role. The accounting and auditing framework is weak, resulting in unreliable



2
accounts and enterprise audits. In particular, there is a need to pursue reforms in the
financial, fishing and mining sectors.
4.    The financial sector comprises four commercial banks, an insurance company, the
social security system and a cooperative agricultural credit facility. The only institutions
which can be said to act as financial intermediaries are the commercial banks. A first
banking restructuring was carried out between 1988 and 1990, supported by the SAC (see
para. 1.). The results have proved less than satisfactory. In the absence of adequate
supervisory and regulatory controls, the banks began to experience problems again. A
more durable solution of the problems necessitated the completion of the privatization of
the banks and a second bank restructuring and bank recapitalization, which was
successfully carried out in 1993 and 1994 without external funding. The next stage of
financial sector development will require consolidating the recent restructuring,
strengthening and enforcing the regulatory and supervisory framework, and developing, in
conjunction with the private sector, mechanisms capable of financing medium- and long-
term investment.
5.    The fishing sector, a vital sector which provides half of Mauritania's foreign
exchange earnings and 20 percent of total budget revenues, is the focus of considerable
private sector interest. It is, however, in a crisis, evidenced by sharply lower catch rates
caused by heavy overfishing and other problems, including: insufficient resources for
national research and the lack of conservation measures; problems of transparency and
efficiency in the allocation of fishing licenses; an inadequate regulatory framework for
resource management, resulting in overfishing and dangerous depletion of precious fishing
resources in certain areas; and an inefficient institutional framework in which the
Government is involved as a producer and a marketing agent for fishing products.
6.    Another focus of private sector activity is mining, which represents an estimated
12 percent of Mauritania's GDP and 38 percent of its exports. A major part of the
production and export is represented by a single state-owned iron ore producer. Potential
investors have expressed interest in exploring for gold and non-ferrous metals. They have,
however, been hindered by lack of geological data and incomplete mining legislation that
introduces uncertainty and negotiating delays.
7.    One of the challenges in developing Mauritania's private sector is to reach out to
the large and growing informal sector and to provide it with services allowing the
blossoming of its most promising elements into full fledge enterprises, taking full
advantage of the improved incentive framework and a better performing financial sector.
The Chamber of Commerce will be rearranged to become a focal point in the dialogue
with the infornal sector, to provide support to emerging entrepreneurs, and to encourage
the development and strengthening of entities representing the interests of informal
entrepreneurs, especially women.
8.    Project Objectives. The major objective of the proposed Capacity Building
Project is to finance activities which will contribute to the realization of the Government



3
of Mauritania's Private Sector Development Program. That program is supported by the
Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC), which is being presented to the Board at the
same time as this operation. In particular, the proposed project will provide assistance to
the Government of Mauritania by strengthening the legal and regulatory framework
surrounding business activities and creating an environment that encourages and facilitates
private investor initiative. The project will focus on activities that lead to: (a) encouraging
investor interest in pursuing opportunities in the private sector, especially in the mining
and fishing subsectors, via a revision of the commercial and tax codes as well as other
activities and (b) strengthening the financial sector, so that it can better provide the credit
and banking services needed by the private sector.
9.    Project Description and Costs The proposed project was appraised at the same
time as the PSDC which will support four components which are key elements of the
GOM's strategy for the development of the private sector in general, and the financial,
fishing and mining sectors in particular, as defined in the context of the Letters of
Development Policy describing the reform program supported by the PSDC (Total
component costs may not exactly correspond to the sum of subcomponents due to
rounding.. These components are:
(a)   Support for the private sector proper, comprising: (i) an accounting and
auditing framework subcomponent (US$0.4 mnillion) to study ways to reorganize and otherwise
improve the accounting profession, as well as to review and revise the Plan Comptable; (ii) a
Chamber of Commerce subcomponent (US$0.2 million) to reorganize it as an autonomous
agency and assist it in representing and serving the needs of the private sector; (iii) a legal and
judiciary reform subcomponent (US$2.6 million) to overhaul the existing legal and regulatory
framework as it applies to business activities; and (iv) a free trade regime subcomponent
(US$0.1 million) to study a mechanism for export promotion;
(b)   Financial sector component, focusing on the: (i) a credit information
subcomponent (US$0.1 rnillion) which will develop a database on the status of credits and
borrower arrears; (ii) a bank training subcomponent (US$0.8 million) for training commercial
bankers in prudent financial management; and (iii) a financial development strategy
subcomponent (US$0.1 million) to study ways to develop the financial sector.
(c)   Fishing and mining sector components (US$1.6 million) to identify the quantity
and quality of resources in the fishing sector as a basis for fish resource management, monitor fish
exports and build up environmental and quality control capabilities, and to develop Government
policies and adopt a legal, regulatory, and tax framework conducive to attracting privately-
financed mining exploration.
10.   Project Financing. The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is
estimated at US$7.9 million, with a foreign exchange cost of about US$5.1 million (65
percent). Cost estimates are based on January 1995 prices, and include physical and price
contingencies. The price contingencies total 3.10 percent of project costs, based on an
annual local inflation rate of 3 percent and an annual international inflation rate of 2
percent. Physical contingencies start at 4 percent of project costs.



4
11.   The high proportion of local costs (36 %) reflects extensive efforts made during
project design to: (a) maximize the use of local consultants; (b) involve local elements in
the technical aspects of the work, both to promote capacity-building and to emphasize on-
the-job training through joint efforts by foreign and local consultants; and (c) involve the
staff of the existing ministries in project implementation, follow-up and coordination, with
support from an existing and experienced implementation unit, the Cellule de
rehabilitation du secteurparapublic, reconstituted as a Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
staffed entirely by Mauritanians.
12.   The proposed financing plan includes an IDA credit of US$7.2 million equivalent,
which will finance 91% of the estimated project costs. This will cover all of the foreign
exchange costs (US$5.1 million) and 75 % of the local costs (US$2.1 million). The
Government will finance the remainder of the local costs (US$0.7 million).
13.   Project Implementation. The executing agencies in charge of the components
will be as follows: (i) upgrading credit risk information, bank training and development of
a long-term financing strategy to benefit small- and medium-size enterprises: the Central
Bank; (ii) development of the accounting and auditing framework: the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU -- see para. 11), which will work closely with the Ministry of
:Finance and coordinate its efforts with the existing Ordre des experts comptables;
(iii) reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce to aid in the promotion of the private
sector, as well as to provide support services to that sector: the Ministry of Commerce
will administrate this component until the Chamber of Commerce is fully operational; (iv)
legal and judiciary reform: the Directorate for Judiciary Affairs of the Ministry of Justice
for the training program, the PCU (see para. 11) for the revision of legal texts (under the
supervision of the Prime Minister's Office and coordinating efforts with concerned
mninistries), and the establishment of the commercial register, and the Secretariat Gin6ral
du Gouvernement at the Prime Minister's office for the indexation of laws and the
publication of an improved Official Bulletin; (v) study for the possible setting up of points
francs as a mechanism for export promotion: the Directorate of Industry at the Ministry of
Mining and Industry; (vi) promotion of private investor interest in the mining sector: the
Directorate of Mining at the Ministry of Mining and Industry; and (vii) survey of fishing
production and foreign exchange flows, setting up of a monitoring mechanism for said
flows and technical support to CNROP (Centre National des Recherches
Oceanographiques et des Peches): the Technical Advisor specifically given that
responsibility at the Ministry of Fishing.
14.   An existing and experienced agency, the Cellule de rehabilitation du secteur
parapublic, wil be functioning as the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The designated
agency has coordinated implementation of the successful PESAP (Public Enterprise Sector
Adjustment Project, MAU-2167).. It should be emphasized that: (a) the PCU will be a
temporary structure operating as an executing agency within the Ministry of Planning; (b)
the PCU will be staffed entirely by Mauritanians; to the extent that it will require the hiring
of temporary staff to handle the added administrative, accounting and legal burdens



5
imposed by the project, the credit will finance the hiring of short-term consultants; and (c)
except for certain components (see para. 13) the task of the PCU will essentially be
coordination, not implementation (the latter being left to executing agencies); the PCU
will be used to: (i) assist in the preparation of annual project and Special Account audits
and semi-annual statement of expenditures (SOE) audits, (ii) process payment requests,
(iii) enforce budgetary control and (iv) ensure compliance with the procurement,
disbursement and other procedures required by the Bank. The PCU will be under the
direct supervision of the Minister of Planning and will receive reports and transmit
information directly to a group of representatives from other ministries associated with
the Private Sector part of the project (Mining and Industry and Justice). Another
important role of the PCU is to ensure maximum client consultation at all stages of project
implementation, and to disseminate information about the GOM's policy measures.
15.   Project Sustainability. The involvement of private sector representatives in the
client consultation process, reinforced by the use of ZOPP (Zieleorientierte
Projektplanung -- objective-oriented project planning) workshops, as well as in the
reconstituted Chamber of Commerce, is expected to lead to lasting improvement in the
dialogue between the private sector and the public authorities. The revision of legal codes
applying to private sector activities, including the mining code as well as minimum
standards for the accounting and auditing professions is expected to improve the business
environment. The training of bankers, accountants and auditors, court auxiliaries and
magistrates and mining officials should improve the quality of services available to the
private sector, strengthen the regulatory and legal framework as well as its enforcement,
and increase the sensitivity of key regulators and providers of support services to the
needs and concerns of the private sector. The training programs will be operated on a
partial cost recovery basis, and those for bankers are likely to prove self-sustaining once
transitional financial support ends. Capacity building for the Chamber of Conmmerce
should lead to the formation of a permanent agency that is able to act as an interlocutor
for private sector agents (both large and small) with the authorities, as well as a conduit
for support to the private sector.
16.   Lessons Learned. The lessons learned from previous capacity building operations
include the following:
(a)   It is essential to involve project beneficiaries in the design, preparation and
implementation of project components which involve them. The successful PESAP
was able to involve enterprises receiving assistance in all stages of dialogue, which
proved highly beneficial during the implementation stage. This participatory
approach has been used in the preparation of this project, and will continue to be
emphasized during project implementation through, inter alia, the use of ZOPP
worksholps.
(b)   A unit responsible for the coordination of project implementation is invaluable to
ensure project success. Virtually all technical assistance programs in Mauritania
other than PESAP have suffered from slow implementation and delayed



6
disbursements. Success was possible in the case of PESAP because of the role
played by the Cellule pour la rehabilitation du secteur parapublic, which ensured
interministerial coordination and handled disbursement and procurement
procedures. The project will involve said unit in the coordination of the
implementation of this projiect, as the implementation of PESAP is now nearing its
end. This will make it possible to capitalize on its experience and on its record of
proven success.
(c)   Rehabilitation of commercial banks requires rigorous follow-up, the upgrading of
the skills of commercial bankers and a better flow of information among banks and
to the Central Bank. The first commercial bank restructuring, which was supported
by the SAC, did not prevent the banks from slipping back into unsound financial
practices and poor portfolio maintenance. Inadequate bank supervision and
imperfect data transmission allowed the problem to go undetected for some time.
This project emphasizes improved information flows and involves the Central Bank,
particularly the Bank Supervision Department, in the implementation of several
ingredients.
17.   Rationale for IDA's Involvement. This project constitutes a logical element in
IDA's program of support to the adjustment process in Mauritania. The project is
designed to complement the PSDC, which will be presented to the Board at the same time
as this project. The project will help promote the objectives identified in the Country
Assistance and Poverty Reduction Strategies for Mauritania (approved February
1994). At this stage in Mauritania's structural adjustment efforts, the growth of
private sector initiative requires the support of various local and possibly foreign
bodies and institutions that only the Bank can help mobilize and coordinate. The
Bank's strategy in Mauritania rests on three objectives: preserving and
rehabilitating existing private sector activities (iron ore and fisheries), facilitating
the emergence of new private sector activities (with emphasis on the policy
environment and the financial sector), and focusing the role of Government on
economic management and human resource development. This project together
with the PSDC will help promote all three.
18.   Status of Project Preparation. The project was identified in February 1993 and
preappraised in July 1994. At that time it was part of a joint adjustment/technical
assistance project which was submitted to the Loan Committee for authorization to
appraise. Based on the Loan Committee recommendation, the original operation was split
into two separate but parallel operations. I'he PSDC was appraised in January 1995.
This Capacity Building Project is needed to support the policy reforms to be implemented
in the context of the PSDC. Detailed TORs for the studies and consultancies to be funded
under the proposed project were prepared by the GOM and have subsequently been
discussed with the Bank.
19.  Issues and Actions. Several issues remain to be addressed, including: (a)
reorganization of the Cellule de la reorganisation du secteurparapublic and



7
reconstituting it as the PCU for this project; (b) a formal agreement from the GOM to
complete the detailed design of the training programs; (c) a formal commitment from the
GOM to review the charter of the Chamber of Commerce to ensure its complete
autonomy; (d) a formal commitment from the GOM to make the studies financed by this
project the basis of subsequent dialogue with the Bank and to carry out their
recommendations in light of dialogue with the Bank; and (e) recruitment of an auditing
firm to establish a satisfactory auditing system for the project components. These issues
were resolved during negotiations and the GOM's assurances in that effect are reflected in
the conditionality of this project.
20.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project is a Category "C" project. The
project was designed to ensure no-detrimental impact on the environment. To the extent
that it promotes the development the fishing and mining sector, which could have
environmental implications, the following steps have been taken to ensure that the impact
will be neutral: (a) institutional strengthening of the CNROP, which will be finalized
during negotiations, will include a budget for environmental capacity building; (b) legal
and judicial reform, which will include the revision of codes affecting business, will
emphasize the environmental dimension of fishing regulation; and (c) environmental
capacity building at the Directorate of Mining, emphasizing the role of environmental
protection in the revision of the mining code.
21.   Program Objective Category. The project will contribute to the Bank's Program
Objective of private sector development.
22.   Participatory Approach. In preparing this project, care was taken to involve, to
the maximum extent possible, representatives of the private and financial sector, as well as
the staff of the various concerned ministries. It was through dialogue with them that the
areas and scope of intervention, the budget for each component, the implementation
schedule, monitoring procedures, and the performance indicators were developed. This
was done to ensure a sense of project ownership as well as a realistic approach to
implementation. Agreement was reached with the GOM to continue client consultation
throughout project implementation, and to make extensive use of ZOPP workshops to
maximize the efficiency of this participatory effort. The project includes financing for two
ZOPP workshops and for an outreach and information program.
23.   Project Benefits. The key focus of the proposed project is making the regulatory
and institutional framework for private sector development conducive to attracting private
investment. As such, the implementation of the proposed project is closely tied to the
reforms envisaged under the PSDC. In the process, the proposed project aims at
promoting the following: (i) better quality banking services and a better financial sector
framework through programs to upgrade the skills of bank supervisors and commercial
bank personnel, accountants, auditors, magistrates and other legal personnel; (ii) improved
access to detailed information on the credit standing of borrowers and on arrears through
revamping the Centrale des Risques and the Centrale des Impayes; (iii) an enhanced legal
and accounting framework which will allow for more transparent procedures and foster



8
accountability and financial discipline in the financial and private sectors; and (iv) an
ongoing dialogue between the private sector and the GOM, as well as a solid mechanism
for extending support services to aid the development of the private sector.
24.   Project Risks. A key risk stems from possible resistance, on the part of vested
interests in Mauritania, to undertaking the reforms, especially those providing support for
the programs geared to upgrading and enforcing regulation of the fishing sector. Also,
there exists a risk that the Chamber of Commerce will be unsuccessful in its efforts to
promote and strengthen the private sector. These risks have been addressed by increasing
the sense of participation and ownership from Government and numerous representatives
of the private sector.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

1991   Cr. 231 1-MAU   Health and          S                 S             31%      Midway through implementation, only 30% of the Credit has
Population                                                   been disbursed, due to delays in preparing bidding documents.
13% of the credit has recently been conunited. An additional
25% of the Credit are scheduled to be committed in the next six
months, and be disbursed in the subsequent year. Expectations
are that, within the next twelve months, the pace of
disbursements will have returned to normal.
1986  Cr. 1658-MAU   Livestock II          S                 S            52.8%     The Project has suffered over the years from: (i) slow
implementation due to late effectiveness (16 month after Board),
poor staffing, several changes in project management, and
disruption due to the decentralization of MDRE; (ii) poor
knowledge of Bank procedures, especially procurements by ICB,
resulting in delays in executing major project's components; (iii)
misuse of funds, resulting in the suspension of disbursements;
(iv) competition from grant funds (Norway). The Project was
restructured in 1993, focusing on strengthening pastoral
associations, and several non performing components were
canceled.
The Project Completion Date is now June 30, 1995
1992   Cr. 2389-MAU   Water               HS                 S             95%      The disbursement lag is mainly due to earlier problems in
Supply                                                       procurement. A mid-term review was carried out in March
1995. At that date, 44% of the credit was committed and related
requests for disbursements are being submitted to IDA.
Subsequent to the review, the component "supply materials" was
redefined and now amounts to 51% of the credit (originally
33%/6), and its implementation is to be completed before late 1995
