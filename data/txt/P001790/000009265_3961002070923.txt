MD(ORhNDK MAND USC     TION OF THSE PRESIDMIT
OF THS INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIIT ASSOCIATION
TO TMl EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO MOZANBIQUE
FOR A FIRST ROADS AND COASTAL SHIPPING PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval thR following memorandum and
recommndation on a proposed development credit to the Republic of
Mozambique for SDR54.1 million, the equivalent of US$74.3 million, to
help finance a first project for rehabilitation sad efficiency
improvement In the roads and coastal shipp&lg transport sub-sectors.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a msturity of 40
years. Other donors would make available parallel financing on
*           concessional terms for SDR36.0 million, the equivalent of US$49.5
million.
2.      The October 1989 Transport Sector Review (Report No. 8656-MOZ),
formally adopted by the Government of Mozambique (GOM) in March 1990,
defined actions and priorities in the transport sector to support the
economic recovery of Mozambique. The report emphasized the need for
well coordinated rehabilitation and efficiency improvement in road and
coastal shipping transport services, with a significantly increase in
Institutional caDacity and the introduction of policy and regulatory
reform, both of which have a long lead time, as necessary pre-
requisites. TLese institutional elements are the main focus of the
proposed First Roads and Coastal Shipping (ROCS-1) Project. The
technical assistance (TA) included in ROCS-1 for Institutional capacity
and policy and regulatory reform addresses both the needs of the
Project, and of two subsequent Roads and Coastal Shipping projects (ROCS
projects) expected to be considered for donor financial support during
the next four years. The proposed credit fully complements the country
strategy by supporting the Government's Priority District Program (PDP)
which is at the core of GON's Economic and Social Rehabilitation Progral
(ZSRP).
3.      Country/Sector Backsround.  For more than two decades Mozambique
has been and still is affected by war. As a consequence of the ensuing
insecurity and economic problems, coupled with ineffective centralized
planning, large elements of the population have either fled the country
or taken refuge in urban centers. resulting in chronic unemployment,
poverty and famine, and one of the lowest per capita GDP in the world.
Prom 1975 to 1986, agricultural production (which still accounts for
about 45 of GDP and 80Z of employmeat and export earnings) fell by
about 30X. GM's Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP), launched in
1987, aimed at restoring macroeconomLc and fiscal stability and
establishing appropriate growth incentives. This successfully reversed
the collapse in production and exports and resulted in a sustained
annual GDP growth rate averaging 5.42 in real terms.  The ERP has since
been succeeded by the ESBP, with similar economic objectives, but also
endeavoring to ensure that the poorest sections of the population
benefit from the adjustment. A central part of the ESRP is GOM's PDP,
which focuses on stimulating development in 40 of Mozambique's 108
districtp considered secure and accessible and with relatively high
agricultural potential, to improve incomes for the rural poor, provide



- 2-v
surplus agricultural produce to feed hungry urban dwellers, and increase
exports.
4.      The natlonal road network has deterlorated to the point where
nearly 40S is in poor or bad condition, creating major obstacles to the
movement of agricultural products to the ports, markets and processing
centers. This deterioration and the current inefficiency of the
trucking industry are primarily the result ofs (i) insufficient skilled
maupower at all levels of the National Directorate of Roads and Bridges
(DNEP) of the Ministry of Construction and Water (M4CA) to plan and
supervise the rehabilitation and muintenance of roads, and of the
National Directorate of Road Transport (DMTh) of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MTC) to promote effective truck fleet
utilization (mostly In the hands of unmotivated state enterprises); (ii)
Inefficient roads Institutional structure In the provinces; (iiI) poor
accessibility to many areas due to lack of security; (iv) inadequate
road maintenance budgets; and (v) foreign exchange restrictions which
constrain private sector access to equipment and spare parts.
5.      The development of coastal shipping operations along the
country's 2,700 km coastline, the cheapest and, In terms of security,
the safest north-south transport mode, has been hampered by scarce
availability of NOH resources due to increasing concentration of efforts
on rehabilitation of the three main port-rail corridors for
international transit traffic in order to generate foreign exchange. As
a result, the Infrastructure and handling equipment in the small coastal
ports, the outlets for major agricultural production In the central and
northern provinces, is in disrepair.  Other factors contributing to t,e
poor conditions prevailing in the small ports include: (i) insufficient
qualified manpower at CPM, the state enterprise responsible for all
Mozambican ports and railways, and at the National Directorate for
Maritime Affairs (DNM) and Bureau of Maritime Projects (GAPROMAR) of
MTC, the agencies responsible for planning and supervision of coastal
shipping; (ii) an obsolete policy and regulatory framework which
restricts management and operation of the small ports and discourages
private sector participation in coastal shipping operations; (iii) the
lack of an adequate fleet for shallow water ports, and inefficient
shipping state enterprises, vhich substantially reduce effective coastal
shipping capacity, and increases costs (iv) MTC's very weak leadership
in long-term planning and in encouraging competitiveness; and tv) poor
and inefficient procurement procedures. Road transport is not an
alternative to coastal shipping because most north-south road corridors
either have not been completed or are impassable due to insecurity.
6.      Project Ob3ectives.  The primary objectives of the proposed
Project are to. (i) develop the institutional capacity in MCA and MTC
necessary to effectively plan and supervise the rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads and the efficiency improvement of small coastal
ports serving the priority districts, and (ii) implement policy reforms
in the trucking and coastal shipping sub-sectors, required to
effectively support the ESRP and the agricultural development
contemplated in GOM's PDP   In particular, ROCS-1 would begin IDA's
long-ternm assistance to GON in developing the Institutional and
managerial- capacity and the policy and regulatory framework required to



successfully implement and sustaix ttansport improvements through this
and subsequent projects.
7.      Project Description.  The Project includess  i) technical
assistance to DNMHGAPROMAR and other coastal shipping organizations, and
to DNEP, intended to provide guidance and assistance during
implementation of this and the two proposed subsequent ROCS prc. ects,
including: (a) overall project management, (b) policy and regulatory
reform, (c) facilitation of greater private sector involvement (awarding
port management contracts, preparing transport state enterprises for
divestiture), and (d) development and preparation of subsequent phases
of a long-term roads and coastal shipping transport sub-sectors
improvement program; (4i) the first five years of a comprehensive
training program for road and coastal shipping personnel; (iii) studies
and implementation of recommendations for policy and regulatory reform
in road financing, procurement, trucking, and the local road contractors
industry; (iv) initial assistance for intermodal facilitation, and for
customs efficiency improvement; (v) small ports investments in
infrastructure and in cargo handling equipment and tugs - the latter to
be funded through a credit line, in five of the fifteen tertiary ports
and in one of the five regional ports; (vi) investments in small port
navigational aids and communications; (vii) final design and preparation
of tender documents for rehabilitation of about 1,800 km of priority
primary roads (approximately 352 of the paved national network); and
(viii) the first phase of a long-term nationwide Feeder Roads Program
(PRP), for the rehabilitation and maintenance in 22 priority districts
of approximately 12t of the estimated 21,000 km feeder road network.
8.      Arrangements for the small ports credit line are in compliance
with OD 8.30, and are consistent with the financial sector strategy
discussed in the April 1992 Financial Sector Study (Report No. 10269-
MOZ). Targeting of credit is justified by the current lack of term
lending in Mozambique and the inexperience of local banks in lending to
concession holders and to the coastal shipping se.tor. The Project
includes technical assistance to strengthen the term lending and coastal
shipping lending operations of the financial sector. Review processes
to be put in place will reduce the risk that resources are channelled to
un-economic endeavors. While much remains to be done, policy reform in
the financial sector is underway. Future actions will be supported by
IDA's Economic Recovery Credit (FY92) and Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (FY94). Interest rates are positive in real terms and have been
substantially liberalized under IMF and IDA supervision.
9.      The Project is expected to be parallel co-financed by AfDB,
BADEA, DANIDA, EEC, France, FINNIDA, Germany, NORAD, RSA, SDC, ASDI
(SIDA), Spain, UNDP, UNCDF and USAID. As shown in Schedule A, total
external financing amounts to the equivalent of US$123.8 million, with
GOM contributing US$20.9 million, plus annual road maintenance budgets,
from its own resources. The annual budget requirements are within the
ceilings set in GOM's 1992-94 Public Investments Three-Year Plan (PTIP).
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as a
disbursement schedule, are included in Schedule B. A timetable of key
Project processing events is contained in Schedule C. The Status of
Bank Group Operations in Mozambique is included in Schedule D.



-4-
10.     Project Imolemontation.  The Project will be implemented by the
respective sectoral ministries. Construction and Water (WCA) will be
responsible fos the road and bridge infrastructure component. Transport
and Comunications (KTC) will coordinate and monitor the coastal
shipping component and road transport elements of the Project. MCA's
National Director of boads and Bridges has been given full formal
authority to represent WCA in the management of Project impleaentation.
NTC has granted similar authority to the Director of its Bureau of
Maritime Projects (GAPROMAR).
11.    To assist GON in the coordination of various donors and Project
components and in the preparation of subsequent roads and coastal
shipplng transport sector improvement projects, a transport management
specialist (funded by UNDP and other donors) will be assigned to the
Project In the capacity of PrLoect Coordinator for approximately three
years on secondent from IDA, under an arrangement similar to a
successful one Implemented in 1990 for the Integrated Roade Project
(IP) In Tanzania (Credit No. 2149-TA).
12.    Proiect Sustainability.  ROCS-1 principal aims is to provide the
institutional capacity and policy and regulatory reform indispensable
for sustainability of investments in the rehabilitation and efficiency
improvement of the transport sector In Mozambique, with initial emphasis
on road and coastal shipping transport services through this and
subsequent ROCS projects.
13.    'Lssons Learmed from Previous IDA Involvement. The proposed
Project is the second operation in the transport sector and the third
investment in physical infrastructure supported by the Bank Group in
Mozambique. It is also the first projoect addressing policy and
regulatory reform in the infrastructure sector. Lessons learned from
the BDera Transport Corrldor Project (Credit No. 2065 MOZ), in which
IDA's participation includes significant capacity building and technical
assistance, and from the road and *treet rehabilUtation and maintenance
component of the Urban Rehabilitatioa Project (Credit No. 1949 MOZ),
have been given full considerat9on in the design of this new operation,
particularly in terms of addressing problems and delays in procurement
of goods and services. and of providing for the prevailing lack of
implesmentation capacity. Project design has taken full account of
experiences described in the recent OZD Report No. 8573: Free-standing
Technical Assistance for Institutional Develooment in Sub-Saharan
AfrFea, by including performance-based procedures for coordinating and
monitoring the Project's TA.
14.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. ROCS-l and subsequent ROCS
projects would be an integral part of IDA's assistance to GON in
accomplishing Mozambique's macroeconomic reform and embarking on
sustainable economic recovery. Such assistance should now focus on
extending manpower development and policy refozm efforts to the
transport modes serving domestic development needs, and on removing the
transport sector bottlenecks that are obstacl e to the ZSRP. IDA is
already funding manpower development efforts in the Beira Transport
Corridor (Credit No. 2065-MOZ) Project because the Corridor is a key
foreign exchange earner, The emphasis on shifting investments to the



private sector as far as possible, as vell as on mobilizing private
sector investment through supporting regulatory reform, is an integral
part of the Bank's strategy to focus 00)8s limited resources where they
are most needed.
15.    Agreements. During negotiations, agreement was reached ons
(t) policy ruform measures In the areas of tariffs, overall policy and
regulatory reform and procurement procedures; (11) G0M action plans and
timetables for implementation of the Road Maintenance Fund,
restructuring of all coastal shipping companies owned directly or
indirectly by 00M together with adoption of policies that allow full
competitiveness and private sector accees to the market, divestiture of
own-account trucking fleets by state enterprises, and removal of
mandatory tariff and entry barriers for long-distance road transport
freight servicesl (111) agreements to be reached at annual reviews on
training program- and small ports credit line on-lending arrangements;
(iv) assurances rigardino acceptable economic rates of return on road
and domestic port investments, environmental assessments on new
Investments in road and small port infrastructure, and annual recurrent
budget allocations and counterpart funding; and (v) undertaking a
comprehensive mid-term review. A condition of effectiveness of the
credit is that the roads general consultants have been selected. Agreed
conditions of disbursement are: (i) for coastal shipping: that GOM has
selected the regulatory sad supervision consultants; (1i) for
disbursement to the Bank of MKoambique (BM) for the small ports credit
line: (a) that a subsidiary administration agreement has been entered
Into between GOM and DM, (b) that 3M has signed participation agreements
with at least two participating financial iustitutions (PFIs), and (c)
that G0M has adopted a policy to award long-term renewable contracts for
the management of mall ports; and (iWi) for disbursement by a PFI to a
port operator for investments in one of the small ports, presentation of
an executed management contract for that port.
16.     Environmental As8ects.  The Project is classified as a '3
project with some possible environmental impact, particularly in the
small ports. A recently completed study on the Development of Coastal
Shipping in Mogambicue funded with an IDA PPF advance- included an
environmental assessment, as well as recommended environmental
protection measures which will be implemented with technical assistance
to MTC and to the newly created National Environmental Commission (CNA)
provided under the Project. Four feasibility studies for the
rehabilltation of primary roads linking feeder road networks in the
priority districts with coastal ports have also been completed using IDA
PPF advance funds. These include environmental assessments and
recommendations to be applied in final designs to be carried out under
the Project.
17.    Program Oblective Categories. The Project would contribute to
attaining key objectives in the following categoriess (i) public sector
reform, through the implementation of comprehensive training programs,
improved planning and supervision practices and procedures, and an
effective policy and regulatory framework; (ii) private sector
participation, through support to the nascent local construction
industry, award of management contractslcone.ssions for  mall-port



operations, development of guidelines for privatizing the trucking
industry, including the adoption of cost-based tariffs, and initiation
of transport and trade facilitation; (iii) poverty alleviation, through
generation of employment resulting from increased access to markets and
reduction of costs, and the use of unskilled rural workers, including
women, on labor-based feeder-road rehabilitation; and (iv) protection of
the environment, through technical assistance to GONs newly created
National Couission for the Environment (CMA) and implementation of
environmental assessments and impact mitigation measures in road and
coastal shipping investments.
18.     Benefits.  Unless accessibility to primary agricultural areas is
improved and transport costs are reduced, the economic recovery programs
cannot be sustained and, without significant policy reform and
institution building, existing transport bottlenecks will not be
overcome. Therefore, substantial quantifiable and non-quantifiable
short and long term benefits are expected from the Project, particularly
in terms of institutional capacity and policy and regulatory reform
necessary for the massive rehabilitation and efficiency improvement of
the transport sector required upon attainment of peace to support
agricultural production recovery, increase employment, reduce food
costs, alleviate poverty and famine, increase export of cash crops, and
reeuce GOM's financial burden imposed by its transport state
enterprises.
19.     Risks.  There are significant risks, particularly the
unpredictable security situation due to the ongoing hostilities, which
may delay Project implementation or increase costs. The current lack of
coordination between Government agencies involved in the transport
sector and their limited institutional capacity are also potential
risks. Flexible design, substantial technical assistance, training and
supervision, frequent formal reviews, and early implementation of policy
and regulatory reform have been included in the Project to reduce the
risks.
20.     Recomendation. I am satisfied that the proposed development
credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
