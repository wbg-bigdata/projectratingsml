                         The Project has not performed well.
                         Pursuant to the 2007 restructuring, the new Project Development Objective is #to increase access to HIV care, prevention and impact mitigations services for high risk groups,
                         vulnerable populations and the general population#.
                         The project generally supported the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC) annual work program agreed upon between GAC and its partners.
                         Much of the project's intention was to reduce high-risk behavior especially among vulnerable groups, including youth.
                         Most of the targets showing behavioral changes and programmatic support are not met. For example, the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS, 2003, 2008) show slow
                         progress. Little funds (0.9% of spending) are going towards preventive care for the vulnerable groups.
                         Generally, much of the project implementation was outsourced to non-government organizations (NGOs). The progress of how and where the resources were used by the NGOs will
                         be reported through a technical and financial audit to be conducted by consultants recruited through GAC, and is to be completed by May/June 2011. Technical audit findings will be
                         key to more clearly determine project performance.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the final year of the project, GAC is expected to conduct an evaluation of the project, to provide evidence of project achievements, hurdles and challenges in achieving project
                         objectives.
                         The recent project review (February 2011) will be the last project review before the June 2011 closing.
                         The Bank and Government are to prepare the project implementation completion report (ICR) in July 2011.
