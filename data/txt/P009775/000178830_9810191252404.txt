INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The State of Madhya Pradesh (MP), located in central India, is the
largest State in India and covers an area of 44.3 M ha, constituting 13.5% of
the total area of the country. There are considerable variations in climate,
soils and topography throughout the State. The monsoon rainfall (mid-June to
late September) comprises some 90% of the total annual rainfall. The rainfall
patterns are erratic and undependable with frequent and extended rainless
periods within the monsoon season. As only a low percentage of the sown area
is irrigated, production varies considerably from year to year. When the
State of MP was reorganized in 1956, only 0.6 M ha were irrigated from all
sources; since then development has been rapid and about 2.1 M ha is currently
under irrigation, representing about 11% of the net cropped area (compared
with the national average of about 26%). Only some 14% of the potential
water resources of the State are currently developed (15% of surface water
potential and 10% of groundwater potential). The Government of MP (GOMP)
gives high priority to the development of irrigation (about 30% of the Sixth
Plan expenditure has been allocated to the development of irrigation).
1.02      The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance to
finance the construction of medium irrigation projects (MIPs) in Madhya Pradesh.
Utilizing water resources of numerous small rivers located throughout the
State, the project would provide irrigation to areas where large scale develop-
ment is not feasible.
Agriculture in India
1.03      India has a population of about 660 M which is growing at an annual
rate of about 1.9%. Since 1960, per capita income grew at an annual rate of
1.4% and reached US$180 in 1979/80. Although the average per capita income
has increased and access to public services has improved, in general, there
has been little change in the incomes of the vast masses of urban and rural
poor, who comprise about 50% of the total population. Accordingly, GOI's
development plans give priority to alleviating poverty and creating employ-
ment, especially in rural areas.
1.04      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and contri-
butes about 45% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and provides
the base for about 55% of India's exports. During the last decade, GOI devel-
opment plans have emphasized agriculture and sought to raise food production
by increasing the use of fertilizers, plant protection chemicals, and improved
seed varieties. In support of this, GOI has modernized and expanded its
agricultural credit institutions and accelerated the development of irrigation.

1.05      In the period 1950/51 to 1977/78, the production of foodgrains rose
at an annual rate of 2.8% (to about 126 M tons) and population at 2.2%; the
average annual increase in per capita production has thus been only 0.6%.
Between 1949/50 and 1964/65, production increased by about 3.0% p.a,; about
50% of this was the result of an expansion in the area under foodgrains and
the proportion of the area double-cropped. But between 1964/65 and 1976/77,
the gross area planted increased by only 5%; 85% of the 50% output growth over
the period was the result of a growth in yields per gross hectare. In this
second period, there were two concentrations of rapid growth (independent of
weather conditions) 1/: (i) 1966/67-1970/71, largely due to the introduction
of wheat varieties on irrigated land in the northwestern States; and (ii)
1973/74-1977/78; mainly due to significant increases in rice yields. In all
cases, progress was dependent upon the continuing expansion of the gross area
irrigated (22.6 M ha in 1950/51 and 49.5 M ha in 1977/78) and the increase in
the use of fertilizers (2.23 kg/ha in 1960/61 and 21.11 kg/ha in 1977/78).
Irrigation in India
1.06      Irrigation was given the highest priority from the beginning of the
planning era in 1950. Some 54.0 M ha are irrigated at present, about 60% of
which is from surface sources and 40% from groundwater. Irrigated areas are
almost four times as productive as rainfed areas and they account for about
60% of all agricultural output. More significant is the fact that the expan-
sion of irrigation facilities and the productivity growth on irrigated lands
have together accounted for at least three-quarters of agricultural growth
since 1960.
1.07      The irrigation potential is expected to grow to 62.3 M ha by the
end of 1982/83 (35% of the cropped area of 180.03 M ha, of which 59% will be
from surface sources and the remainder from groundwater sources). 2/ With
little idle land left for cultivation, very little increase is expected in the
net sown area in the future and the main increases in agricultural production
will need to come from double cropping and from improvements in water manage-
ment and agricultural inputs. If the expected doubling of the gross irrigated
area in the next 20 years is to be achieved, a much greater efficiency in
water use will be required. In most completed projects the actual irrigated
areas are less than planned and yields have been much lower than originally
forecast. GOI and the State Governments are aware of the challenge and are
seeking solutions to the dual problem of low irrigation intensities and poor
yields. Solutions involve improved efficiency of the physical system, more
flexible and imaginative water management practices and improvements in the
supply of agricultural inputs (credit, extension, etc.).
1.08      The projects of the early 1960s involved a storage or diversion dam
and main canal system only, leaving distribution of water from the project

outlets to the farmers.  As some of these outlets served areas in excess of
100 ha, conveyance of water to the farmgate necessitated the construction of
minor channel networks that were sometimes several kilometers long. In most
projects, farmers were unable to finance or organize the construction of the
minor channels without outside assistance, which was only rarely available.
The very long delays between water availability in the main conveyance system
and its use by farmers made these irrigation projects a marginal investment.
1.09      In the early 1970s, the concept of the Command Area Development
Authority (CADA) evolved. Its objective was to coordinate the activities of
the Irrigation and Agriculture Departments and to assist farmers in obtaining
institutional credit for the construction of the minor systems and levelling
and bunding of their fields. Undoubtedly, there have been benefits from the
creation of the CADA; however, the results have been less than expected.
Further analysis of the reasons for the gap between potential created and
actually utilized and lower irrigated cropping intensities and yields than
forecast indicates that more emphasis should now be placed on improving the
efficiency and reliability of the conveyance system, and that the Government
should assume responsibility for conveying water much closer to the farmgate.
only when the farmer is confident of his water supply will he undertake the
necessary investments to make full use of the water supplied. These improve-
ments will be incorporated into the proposed project.
II. SECTOR BACKGROUND: THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH
General
2.01      Madhya Pradesh (MP) is India's largest State, covering an area of
44.3 M ha and has a population of about 52 M (1980). Although MP is rich
in natural resources (minerals, fuel, timber, iron ore, etc), they are as
yet relatively unexploited. The economy is largely dependent on a stagnant,
low-productivity agricultural sector; the removal of constraints to agricul-
tural growth--particularly through the expansion of irrigation and improved
water management--is thus a precondition for economic progress. By most
indicators, Madhya Pradesh is one of the poorest States in India.
The Economy
2.02      The per capita income of MP was Rs 896 in 1977/78 current prices,
compared to Rs 1,163 for the country as a whole. The economic growth of MP
is largely dependent on agriculture; between 1970/71-1977/78, State income
grew at an annual rate of 1.8%, which was much lower than the growth of the
Indian economy. However, because of the population increase, the per capita
income actually declined in the same period by 0.9% per annum, compared to a
1.1% growth in the national average. The pattern of stagnation of MP economy
compared with the rest of India is summarized below:

2.03      The zero growth rate of primary net domestic product is mainly due
to the stagnation of foodgrain production, which increased at only 0.2% p.a.
over the period; this contrasts with the 3.4% p.a. growth rate of the primary
sector in the Indian economy. The low-productivity agricultural sector domin-
ates the State's economy, providing about 55% of the State Domestic Product
(SDP) and employing about 80% of the working population. While in the period
1968/69-1978/79 total area under foodgrains increased by 1.5 M ha from 16.3 M
to 17.8 M, yields remained stagnant and are about 50% below the national
average; fertilizer use in MP is about one-third of the national average.
2.04      Production in the industrial sector, which started at a low base,
grew rapidly, at 6.2% p.a., although it still contributed only 19.6% of State
Domestic Product (SDP). Employment in manufacturing accounts for only 6.6%
of the labor force, as compared with 9.4% in all-India. According to various
estimates the State possesses 44% of the country's bauxite reserves, 50% of
the manganese, 30% of high grade iron ore reserves, 25% of coal reserves and
27% of India's total forest resources. Recently, rich deposits of copper have
been discovered. The State is estimated to be endowed with 11% of the coun-
try's total hydro-electric power potential, second only to Assam. However,
the per capita industrial power consumption in MP is only 80% (49 kwh) of the
all-India consumption (61 kwh).
Socio-Economic Conditions
2.05      Population.  NMP has one of the highest birth rates in India and
its estimated population of 52 M (1980) is growing at about 2.6% per annum.
The population density of 94 persons per square kilometer is low compared
with the national average of 167. The population is predominantly rural
(84%) and is scattered in small villages with average population of some
430 persons per village.
I.Q6      Just over 20% of the population is tribal, giving MP the largest
concentration of tribal peoples in India. Thirty-three percent of the State's
inhabitants belong to the so-called "backward classes".



2.07      The labor force constitutes about 37% of the total population.
The labor participation rate in rural areas is about 38% and in urban areas
28%. Cultivators and agricultural laborers account for 53% and 27% of the
labor force, respectively.
2.08      Rural Incomes and Wealth.  In a normal year, about 66% of the
population has incomes below the poverty line (US$80). 1/ However, there
are large regional variations in the incidence of poverty. In the eastern
and southern parts of the State about 90% of the population live below the
poverty line, while the proportion in the western region is about one half.
2.09      Farm Size and Land Tenure.  The large number of small farmers, com-
plex tenancy arrangements and a high percentage of tribal people pose great
difficulties for modernizing the agricultural sector. The average farm size
in MP has decreased from 4.0 ha in 1970/71 to 3.6 ha in 1976/77, ranging from
1.8 ha in Bilaspur District to 7.0 ha in Vidisha district (Table T-3).
2.10      The Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act from 1960 limiting the
maximum amount of land owned to 30 ha per landowner was amended in 1974. At
present a landowner is entitled to retain a maximum of 7.2 ha of irrigated
land and 22 ha of rainfed land. According to the 1970 Agricultural Census,
70% of all holdings were owner-operated.
Public Services
2.11      The network of primary and secondary schools is deficient. The
literacy rate of 22% in MP is among the lowest in India; the national average
is 29% (Table T-2).
2.12      In rural areas, the number of doctors and health centers per 1,000
persons is well below the national average. The provision of safe drinking
water is a serious problem. According to GOMP, only about 25% of all villages
have been provided with safe drinking water supply. Financial constraints do
not allow a large program that would improve this situation.
2.13      The progress of rural electrification has been lagging behind other
States and presently only about 17% of the villages have electric power. In
the Sixth Plan, GOMP has allocated a major share of investible resources to
power sector, which will also improve the electricity supply to agriculture.
2.14      Most systems of communication are deficient in MP.  In particular,
there are few major highways, and the road network is poor. With a highway
density of 10.3 km per 100 sq. km, the State is well below the national average
of 30.0 km. The insufficient road network inhibits the exploitation of natural
resources and the modernization of agriculture. The railway system is also
deficient.

III. SECTOR BACKGROUND: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR I/
3.01      Agricultural Performance.  The agricultural sector dominates the
State economy, yet much potential remains to be developed, and its water
resources have yet to be fully exploited (currently only 15% of the poten-
tial is utilized). The 1977/78 net area sown amounted to 18.8 M ha, 84% of
cultivable area, mostly single-cropped during the monsoon season or in the dry
rabi season on stored soil moisture following a monsoon fallow. Only 11% of
the total cropped area is at present irrigated.
3.02      Between 1965/66 and 1978/79, the production of foodgrains increased
at the rate of 3.8% p.a., while the average Indian rate was 3.4% p.a. for the
period 1964/65 to 1978/79. Production levels for other crops in MP have
remained almost constant. The foodgrain increases have been due almost
entirely to small increases in area sown. Due to the variability in rainfall,
yield levels of all crops have fluctuated widely year by year, but with no
significant trend upward for any major crop with the exception of wheat,
where yields have increased over the same period at a rate of about 2% p.a.
3.03      In the period of ten years from 1968/69 to 1978/79, the total area
under foodgrains increased by 1.5 M ha from 16.3 M to 17.8 M. At the same
time there have been appreciable changes in the cropping pattern. The rice
area increased by 510,000 ha to 4.82 M ha, this increase being mainly on
marginal lands brought newly under cultivation, while the area under jowar
decreased by 500,000 ha to 1.86 M ha, bajra also declined by 50,000 ha, but
maize increased by 100,000 ha. Among the rabi crops, the wheat area increased
by nearly 800,000 ha to 3.8 M ha, much of this increase resulting from an
increase of 560,000 ha in the irrigated areas. The area under pulses increased
by 740,000 ha, accounted for mainly by an increase in gram (240,000 ha), urad
(black gram), mung (green gram), teora (vetch) and the introduction of soya-
bean on 200,000 ha. Oilseeds increased by 200,000 ha, with increases in rabi
oilseeds (linseed, mustard), but decreases in groundnuts and sesame. The area
under cotton has remained substantially unchanged. In general, an increase in
irrigated cropping, other than paddy, of some 740,000 ha has resulted in
farmers switching from coarse grains (jowar and bajra) to rabi crops. Quick
maturing high yielding varieties of jowar which can be readily followed by a
second crop have so far been introduced on 20% of the jowar area.
3.04      Yields of most major food crops in MP are significantly below India's
already low average. The discrepancy is most marked in the two major food-
grains, rice and wheat. For both rice and wheat, the Indian average is roughly
50% higher than the MP yields. This reflects the relatively high proportion
of rainfed and unimproved varieties of wheat and rice, and the low consumption
of fertilizers, at one-third the national average. The yields of coarse grains
(jowar, maize, bajra and barley) are more in line with all-India averages,
but oilseed yields are very low, at 60% of the India average, and MP's yields
of cash crops have grown relatively slowly. Cotton yields grew at 1.7% in
India, but remained stagnant in MP.
1/   See also Annex 3.



- 7 -
3.05      Fertilizer use in MP, although it has recently accelerated, presently
averages less than 7 kg nutrient per ha, about one-third of the national ave-
rage. From 1968 to 1972, during a period of relatively rapid growth in irri-
gated area accompanied by increased use of HYV seed, fertilizer use increased
at a rate exceeding 50% per year. The increases occurred entirely for rabi
season use, and even now more than 70% of annual consumption is distributed
for that season.  However, the combined use of fertilizers, HYV seed, and
irrigation, is still very limited.
3.06      In spite of low yields and largely traditional methods of agricul-
ture, and because of the low population density, production of foodgrains per
capita in a normal year is 25% higher than the all-India average and the State
normally has a surplus of 1 M t for export. MP contributes 17% of India's
production of pulses.
Agricultural Constraints
3.07      In spite of the fact that MP has a relatively high rainfall compared
with many other parts of the semi-arid regions of India, marked year to year
variations in the amount and timing of rainfall jeopardize production and make
farmers reluctant to invest in fertilizers, pesticides and improved seed.
Long breaks in and an early withdrawal of the monsoon can cause severe plant
stress and are particularly damaging in the case of the rice crop. Yields of
rainfed rabi crops are constrained by the limited availability of soil mois-
ture at the beginning of the growing season, and thus show a poor response to
fertilizer. The low cropping intensity reflects the fact that except with
irrigation only one crop can normally be grown. The State is therefore giving
high priority to the extension of irrigation, both from surface and underground
sources, and to increasing the effectiveness of existing irrigation projects,
through the provision of a more timely and reliable water supply. Agricultural
programs proposed under the Sixth Plan lay emphasis on assistance to the
smaller farmers to help them switch from production of cereals for their own
subsistence to higher value crops and to increase yields sufficiently to
obtain a marketable surplus. Emphasis is also placed on utilization during
kharif of large areas now left fallow because of difficult workability of the
soils during the monsoon season. Here, drainage and land shaping, as well as
irrigation, will play an important part. Soyabean has proved a most promising
crop under these conditions and it is proposed to try and extend the area of
this crop to 1 M ha by the end of the Sixth Plan.
Crops and Cropping Patterns in the Agroecological Zones 1/ (Map IBRD 15151)
3.08      Wide variations in climate, soil and topography create varying con-
ditions for agriculture in different parts of the State. Seven major agro-
ecological zones are distinguished on the basis of climate--especially rainfall
and winter temperatures--topography and prevailing soil type. Rainfall varies
from less than 800 mm in the west and northwest to over 1,600 mm in the north-
east and southeast. Winter temperatures are affected both by latitude and
1/   Details of crops and cropping patterns expected under the project are
given in Annex 3.

altitude; warm winters adversely affect the performance of rabi crops, espe-
cially wheat. The different zones can be classified as having warm, mild or
cool winters, with average minimum temperatures in December and January of
over 130 C, 100 - 130 C, and below 100 C, respectively. Frosts are
recorded in some northern areas. Present cropping patterns for the different
zones are shown in Table T-9 and mainly reflect rainfed cropping practice.
The present areas of crops irrigated in each zone and the proportion of the
total crop area that is irrigated is shown in Annex 3, Table 1. Present cover
by high yielding varieties is shown in Annex 3, Table 3.
3.09      The Rice Zone (Zone 1) in the eastern part of the State includes
the Chhatisgarh Plain, the Wainganga Valley (Zone la) and neighboring plateau
areas of Bastar (Zone lb) and Sarguja (Zone lc). Rainfall averages from 1,200
mm in the Chhatisgarh Plain (marginal for production of rainfed rice) to
1,600 mm in the plateau areas. Winters in the Chhatisgarh plain are warm,
but mild to cool in the plateau areas. Except in the plateau areas where soils
are mainly shallow and light in texture, soils vary from sandy claim loams on
moderate slopes to clays in the lower lying areas. Rice occupies over 50% of
the net cropped area and this zone accounts for nearly 70% of the MP rice area
and 80% of the State's production. About 20% of the rice in this zone is
irrigated; the irrigated areas are concentrated in the Chhatisgarh Plain and
Wainganga Valley where modern varieties account for 50% of the cropped area.
Pulses and linseed sown direct into the standing paddy before harvest account
for the relatively high cropping intensity of 129% in this subzone. The
neighboring plateau areas have a high proportion of tribal population (58%
in Surgaja, 68% in Bastar) growing rice and minor millets on what are mainly
marginal soils. The average size of holdings is 2.75 ha, with 29% of land in
holdings of more than 10 ha.
3.10      The Rice/Wheat Zone  (Zone 2) adjoins the Rice Zone to the west
and includes the Kymore Plateau and upper Narmada Valley. Rainfall varies
from 1,000 mm to 1,400 mm. Winters are cool to mild. The Kymore Plateau
itself has shallow skeletal soils covered mainly with poor forest and scrub,
but is deeply incised by wide flat valleys which together with the upper
Narmada Valley account for nearly all the good agricultural land. The main
crops are rice and wheat, each accounting for 25% to 40% of the cropped area.
Other important crops include minor millets in kharif on shallow soils and
gram (chick pea) in rabi. There has been relatively little development of
irrigation in this zone. The zone also has a high proportion of tribals
concentrated mainly on marginal agricultural lands, on the plateau and in
Mandla district which has shallow gravelly soils. The average size of hold-
ings is 3.1 ha with 36% of land in holdings of more than 10 ha.
3.11      The Wheat Zone (Zone 3) occupies the central part of the State and
includes the Vindhya Plateau and central parts of the Narmada Valley. Winters
are cool to mild. With a relatively high rainfall of from 1,200 mm to 1,400
mm, deep or medium deep clay soils and relatively flat topography, poor drain-
age and waterlogging pose problems for cultivation of kharif crops which occupy
only 10% to 25% of the net cropped area (mainly sorghum) on better drained
sites. The remainder of the land is sown with rabi crops after a kharif fallow
and yields depend on stored soil moisture. Only 5% of crops are irrigated.
Wheat occupies up to 50% of the cropped area and this zone accounts for 35% of



- 9 -
the MP wheat area and 34% of the production. Only 20% of the wheat crop is
sown with modern varieties. Apart from the Tawa Project, there has been little
development of irrigation in the zone. Other important rabi crops are gram
(chick pea), lentil and linseed. Holdings are large, averaging 5 ha and nearly
half the agricultural land is in holdings of more than 10 ha. The prevalence
of large holdings has proved a distinct hindrance to the intensification of
production in Tawa Project and in existing medium projects in the zone.
3.12      The Jowar/Wheat Zone (Zone 4) in the southern part of the State
covers the Satpura Plateau. This is primarily a kharif cropping area with
jowar (sorghum), minor millets and pulses occupying about 60% of the cropped
area while about 25% to 30% is sown with wheat and gram during rabi. Soils
are mainly shallow and rainfall averages 1,000 mm to 1,200 mm; two tehsils at
the south of Betul district are classified as drought prone areas. Irrigated
crops account for 8% of the cropped area. This zone also has a fairly high
tribal population (33%). The average size of holdings is 4.25 ha with 38%
of land in holdings of more than 10 ha.
3.13      The Cotton/Jowar Zone (Zone 5) occupies the western part of MP and
includes the Malwa Plateau (Zone 5a), Nimar Plain (Zone 5b) and Jhabua Hills
(Zone 5c). This zone has low rainfall, varying from less than 800 mm to
1,100 mm. Twenty out of a total of 31 tehsils 1/ in the zone are classified as
drought prone areas. Irrigation, mainly from wells, covers 10% of the cropped
area. The soils are medium to shallow black cotton soils, except in the Jhabua
Hills which have sandy soils, and cropping is mainly in kharif with jowar and
cotton the principal crops. The Nimar Plain, with mild to warm winters, forms
the main cotton growing area; the Malwa Plateau and Jhabua Hills have cool
winters. Pulses, normally intercropped with jowar, are also grown on a large
scale and the area of soyabean is increasingly important. In spite of the
fact that holdings are fairly large, averaging 4.9 ha with 37% of the land
in holdings of more than 10 ha, many of the most successful existing medium
irrigation projects are found in this zone. The main irrigated crops are
Mexican wheat, cotton, sugarcane and gram. This zone also has a fairly large
tribal population concentrated especially in Jhabua (85%), Dhar (53%) and
Khargone (40%) districts in the southwestern part of the State and in the
lowest rainfall areas.
3.14      The Wheat/Jowar Zone (Zone 6) in the northern part of the State
includes the Bundelkand region bordering UP and part of the Gird Region.
Rainfall averages from 800 mm to 1,000 mm, one tehsil in Dhatia district
being classified as a drought prone area. Winters are cool. Soils are of
light to medium texture. Irrigation is fairly well developed with 27% of
the net cropped area under irrigation. The most important crops are wheat,
of which a high proportion (60%) is irrigated and gram in rabi, and jowar,
minor millets, pulses and sesamum in kharif. Holdings are relatively small,
averaging 3.3 ha, with only 28% of the land in holdings of more than 10 ha.
Uptake of irrigation on medium projects has been satisfactory with HYV wheat,
barley and gram the main irrigated crops.

3.15      The Wheat/Bajra Zone (Zone 7) in the northern most part of the
State includes Bhind and Morena districts. Rainfall is low, being less
than 800 mm but irrigation is well developed, covering 37% of the net sown
area, provided largely by the Chambal system. Winters are cool. Soils
are deep alluviums. The main crops are wheat, gram and mustard in the rabi
season. Seventy percent of the wheat crop is irrigated. During kharif,
bajra (pearl millet) and jowar are the most important crops. This zone has
the lowest average farm size in MP at 2.7 ha with only 15% of the land in
holdings of more than 10 ha.
Dairying
3.16      The State has an acute deficit of milk with total production esti-
mated at only 4.5 M liters. During 1975, the MP Dairy Development Corporation
was set up to implement the MP Dairy Development Project (Credit 522-IN, see
para 4.08). This involved a program of upgrading local cattle, leguminous
fodder production, demonstration farms and extension. Progress is satisfac-
tory on this program, which envisages the establishment of 1,200 village
cooperative societies and three Milk Producers Cooperative Unions, one each at
Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain on the "Amul" pattern.
Fisheries
3.17      The State has considerable potential for development of fisheries
with 263,000 ha of water at present available and a further 137,000 ha likely
to be produced by irrigation projects contemplated in various river basins.
During the Sixth Plan, investment of Rs 73 M is proposed and a program for
intensive development of inland fisheries is envisaged.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.18      Agricultural Research.  The Jawaharlal Nehru Krishni Vishwa Vidyalaya
(JNKVV) has been responsible for agricultural research since 1964. The uni-
versity's six campuses and research stations--Jabalpur, Gwalior, Rewa, Sehore,
Indore and Raipur cover the main agricultural zones. There is also a main
research center at Powarkheda serving the Tawa command and 13 smaller research
farms. Limited research on irrigated agriculture is conducted at all the main
research centers. The university recently took over the MP Rice Research
Station, Raipur, which is also a center for the ICAR All-India Coordinated
Rice Research Program.
3.19      Research on irrigated agriculture has focussed mainly on deter-
mination of water requirements in relation to critical stages of crop growth,
climate and soil type. Relatively little attention has been given to irriga-
tion practices and land development for irrigation.
3.20      Agricultural Extension Services.  Following the success in neigh-
boring Rajasthan of the T & V system of extension, GOMP first introduced it
in the Chambal Command area in 1976; it is at present in operation in 15 dis-
tricts.  Strengthening extension in these districts has given good results and
it is now intended under the Sixth Plan, with IDA support (Cr. 712-IN, see
para 4.08), to complete the cover of the State by 1982-83. An additional



- 11 -
five districts will be covered in 1980/81, ten in 1981/82, and 15 in 1982/83.
A VLW will be provided for every 600-800 families and an Agricultural Exten-
sion Officer will supervise 8 VLW. A Subdivisional Agricultural Officer
covers two to three development blocks and is assisted by Subject Matter
Specialists in Plant Protection, Agronomy and Water Management and in Train-
ing, Information and Publicity. In each district, a Deputy Director of
Agriculture will be assisted by four SMS in Plant Protection, Agronomy, Water
Management and Training. In each block, there will be one Senior Extension
Officer, assisted by three VLW to coordinate supply functions.
Agricultural Inputs
3.21      Until now provision of improved seed has been mainly through 121
government agricultural farms with a cultivated area of 3,800 ha. These
have been unable to meet the requirement. A State Seed and Farm Corporation
is currently being set up with an authorized share capital of Rs 100 M. This
corporation will gradually take over the farms from the AD and contract with
farmers to produce quality seed. Major crops in the different agricultural
zones will be given priority. An independent Seed Certification Agency has
also been set up. Existing seed testing laboratories at Jabalpur and Gwalior
will be strengthened and an additional laboratory will be set up at Indore.
Fertilizers are distributed through cooperative and private channels. In
1978/79 the share of the cooperatives was 58%.  Cooperatives have 3,158 dis-
tribution points and private traders 2,616 points. In spite of this wide
distribution network, farmers in many districts have some difficulty in
obtaining timely supplies. One of the major constraints in popularizing use
of fertilizers has been reluctance of cooperatives to lift stocks from sup-
pliers in advance of the sowing season for fear of losses due to uncertain
sales and long storage. It is proposed to subsidize transport and storage of
fertilizers with provision of Rs 22.5 M during the Sixth Plan.
3.22      Marketing of pest control chemicals is handled by the Agro
Industries Development Corporation. During the Sixth Plan it is proposed to
subsidize interest, and storage charges on agrochemicals purchased at the
behest of the AD and to strengthen the stock of equipment held by the
Department.
Farm Mechanization
3.23      Madhya Pradesh has about 22,000 tractors.  On a per ha basis, this
is below the national average; most are owned by large farmers. The MP Agro
Industries Development Corporation has a program for establishing agro-service
centers of which 85 have been set up for custom hiring of tractors. Reliance
for farm power is therefore still very largely on animal power. There are
some 10 M working cattle or approximately one pair per 4 ha of cultivated land,
though availability differs widely in different agricultural zones, ranging
from 1 pair per 2.7 ha in Zones 1 and 2 to one pair per 5 ha to 6 ha in Zones
3 and 5.



- 12 -
Marketing
3.24      Marketing of agricultural produce is less developed in MP than in
many other Indian states. Only half of all markets which accept notified pro-
duce are regulated and of these only 15-20% are improved markets with modern
handling facilities. So far, 250 regulated markets and 69 submarkets have
been established. Out of the 459 community development blocks that cover the
State, 356 are within reach of regulated markets or submarkets. During the
Sixth Plan period it has been decided to have a regulated market or at least
a market yard in every block by establishment of an additional 50 markets and
100 submarkets.
Agricultural Credit
3.25      The organization of institutional credit to farmers follows the
usual pattern in India. The cooperative banks which provide short (up to one
year) and medium term credit to farmers through the primary cooperative socie-
ties at an interest rate of 12-12 1/2% are organized on a three tier basis
with the MP State Cooperative Bank at State level, 44 central cooperative
banks at district level (Bhopal and Sehore districts have one bank) and 6,525
primary credit societies with 29 M members. About 44% of farmers are coopera-
tive members; 411 development blocks out of 459 in the State have branches of
the central cooperative banks. The remaining blocks and other important
centers are to be covered in the Sixth Plan period by opening a further 100
branches.  Loans advanced increased from Rs 556 M in 1973/74 to Rs 891 M in
1978/79. At the end of 1979 a total of Rs 1,341 M of loans were outstanding,
of which 41% were overdue. Repayment rates, though lower than in earlier
years, still permit extending loans. Rescheduling procedures exist and are
practiced.
3.26      The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Land Development Bank disburses
long term loans to farmers and has 45 affiliated District Land Development
Banks with 260 branches all over the State. Loans are advanced mainly for
dug wells, tubewells and pumping equipment. Lending increased from Rs 1.25 M
in 1961/62 to Rs 227 M in 1976/77, but declined to Rs 117 M in 1978/79 due to
inability of DLDBs to improve their debt recovery performance. The proportion
of overdues has increased steadily in recent years and reached 56% at the end
of 1978/79. These loans are refinanced through the Agricultural Refinance and
Development Corporation (ARDC).
3.27      The commercial banks have been steadily increasing their lending to
agriculture and now have over 1,200 branches in rural and semi-urban areas.
Under the RBIs program for financing of PACS by commercial banks, 204 socie-
ties were transferred to them in 1978/79 of which 150 were financed. Total
agricultural loans outstanding at the end of 1978/79 amounted to Rs 1,081 M.
The commercial banks also have a serious problem of recoveries, but are better
able than the cooperative banks to absorb overdues.
3.28      Financing of small and marginal farmers is available from 13 Small
Farmer Development Agency Projects and from Regional Rural Banks covering nine
districts.

IV. SECTOR BACKGROUND: THE IRRIGATION SECTOR
Need for Irrigation (see Table T-8 for mean monthly rainfall in each zone)
4.01      Rainfall in the State of Madhya Pradesh as well as throughout the
Deccan Plateau (Central India) comes almost entirely from the southwest mon-
soon wind movements. Moist cold air advancing from the Arabian Sea moves along
the western coast of India and then pushes over the Ghats into the interior
of the Indian continent. Studies by the India Meteorological Department for
the State of Maharashtra show that for seventy monsoon seasons (1901-1970)
the mean date for commencement of sowing rains (CSR) is earliest (June 2) at
Goa and by June 8 has progressed northward to Colaba (Bombay) and to the
southern coast of Saurashtra in the State of Gujarat by June 20. The CSR
movement inland and eastward of the  _-. of the ghats is much later and much
more variable. Some areas do not benefit from the monsoon rains until well
into July (July 4-6, for example, at Aurangabad in Maharashtra). Studies at
Labhandi Research Farm near Raipur for a 29-year period places the average
date at June 21 but with beginning dates ranging between June 1 and July 16.
4.02      Of even more significance in determining the need for and value of
irrigation is the length of the interval between the commencement of sowing
rains (CSR) and the next realization of a significant rain. This interval is
as long as 32-34 days in parts of Maharashtra. Nagpur, for example, shows
that on a percentage distribution, 66% of the observations showed rainfall
reoccurring in 10 days or less; 317 showed an 11-20 day break in rains; and
3% showed over 20 days elapsing without rain. A similar pattern can be
derived by analysis of the daily rainfall for climatic stations in MP. The
wide variability in start of sowing rains and the difficulty in establish-
ing a consistent rainfall pattern places plants frequently under stress
at time of germination and initial crop growth when water is especially
critical. With irrigation the planting can be done on schedule without guess
work and in amounts sufficient to establish a good seed bed, and to ensure
good seed germination and initial growth.
4.03      The short duration of the monsoon season or an earlier than normal
receding of the monsoon rains further aggravates the problems of equating
moisture with plant needs. The total annual or monsoon rainfall amount can
be misleading. Rainfall in the month of August is consistently 40% or more
of total rainfall so that rainfall occurring towards the end of the crop's
growing season is generally insufficient. The studies at Labhandi show the
monsoon receding between September 7 and October 11 dates with an average
date of September 28. The interval between onset and receding has been as
short as 60 days and has averaged only 100 days--much less than the 120 days
or more needed to mature most kharif crops. In summary, therefore, irrigation
is needed at the time of sowing to ensure good germination, to reduce the
stress (particularly to rice) caused by the variability in interval between
the CSR and the next significant rain; and toward the end of the growing
season when yields can be reduced drastically by stress at the critical
flowering and fruiting stages.

Irrigation Development
4.04      A major part of the irrigation potential of MP is yet to be exploited.
Despite the fact that within MP are the catchments of all eleven of the major
rivers 1/ of central India, only 11% of the net cropped area (about 2.2 M ha)
in the State is irrigated, compared to the national average of about 26%.  At
present, only about 15% of the groundwater and the surface water potential is
utilized (18% in the Ganga Yamuna Basin, 17% in the Mahanadi Godavari Basin,
and 8% in the Narmada Tapti Basin).

schemes) and half from wells (largely private):

About one-third of the canal irrigation is under major schemes (over 10,000
ha), about one-third under medium schemes (2,000-10,000 ha), and about one-
third under minor schemes (below 2,000 ha). Irrigation is almost exclusively
limited to one season; less than 5% of the irrigated area receives irrigation

in both seasons. Details of irrigation by district and source are given in
Table T-3.
4.05      Since much of the surface area of the State is over hard rock, the
potential for groundwater development is fairly limited, compared with the
potential for surface water; the unexploited groundwater potential has been
estimated at 1.7 M ha of irrigation, compared with about 9.0 M ha from surface
water. Thus, most of the increase in irrigation in the State will have to
come from surface water resources.
Irrigation Performance
4.06      The State accords a high priority to irrigation as a means of rais-
ing both agricultural production and the incomes of the rural poor. Since
the first Five Year Plan, this sector has continued to receive a large share
of Plan allocation, currently about 30%. Investments in irrigation are also
made under the "Tribal Sub-Plan", designed to cater specifically to the needs
of the tribal population (para 2.06).

The development of irrigation potential 1/ and utilization are shown in Table
T-7 between 1956/57 and 1978/79, the increase in potential created was about
6% p.a. The percentage utilization has ranged from 59% to 76% of potential
since the First Plan.
4.07      A review of the performance of existing MIPs in the State was
carried out as part of the appraisal (see Annex 2). Given the priority in
1/   This terminology is commonly used in India but is misleading in that
it is the construction of the dam and main canal that is the measure of
potential whether or not the distribution network is in place and ope-
rating. The "utilization" figures are recorded as the sum of the area
in each season for which farmers have applied for irrigation (the "agree-
mented" area), whether or not water is actually supplied.

Plan allocations, and the apparent rate of utilization, the growth in the
benefits from irrigation could have been much higher. The two principal
constraints to the development of irrigation in MP have been:
(a) long construction periods for major and medium projects; and
(b) slow and uneven uptake of irrigation once the facilities have
been created.
In many cases, dams have been built and water stored, but distribution systems
left incomplete, with outlet command areas (chaks) ranging from 40 ha to over
100 ha. Because of this lag in the construction of the distribution systems,
the water has been preempted at the head of the system; this, combined with
the ability of influential groups to monopolize water, has resulted in large
areas--especially at the tail-end of the commands--being left unirrigated.
Other factors contributing to the slow and uneven uptake of irrigation have
been:
(a)  the low level of technology adopted in the planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of the irrigation
system; and
(b)  over-optimistic design assumptions about crop water requirements
and irrigation losses, which have not been monitored under actual
field conditions; this has led to a significant overestimation of
the area that can be irrigated with the water available.
Previous Bank Group Operations in Madhya Pradesh
4.08       The Bank Group has directly contributed to the development of MP's
agricultural sector through five previous IDA credits, but its involvement in
irrigation has been small compared with the Bank Group contribution to irriga-
tion in some other states in India. The MP Agricultural Credit Project
(US$33.0 M credit of June 8, 1973, Cr. 391-IN) was designed to expand and
improve the credit facilities available to farmers throughout the State. The
MP Dairy Project (US$16.4 M credit of December 18, 1974, Cr. 522-IN) is sup-
porting dairy development organized along the lines of the successful Amul
dairy cooperative set up in neighboring Gujarat. Farmer response has been
excellent and the Government is under considerable producer pressure to speed
up the establishment of dairy cooperatives throughout the State. The Chambal
(MP) Command Area Development Project (US$24.0 M credit of June 20, 1975,
Cr. 562-IN) is designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization in the
command area of the Chambal Project in MP and bring additional areas under
irrigation. This project started slowly, but is now about to be completed.
The major constraint was the slow acceptance by the farmers, of on-farm
development which was meant to be carried out, and paid for, by the farmers
themselves with agricultural credit available to them from the proceeds of the
credit (the reduction of the outlet command size from some 40 ha to about 8 ha
in MP, as is now the policy elsewhere in India also, has meanwhile eliminated
this problem). The NP Forestry Technical Assistance Project (US$4.0 M credit
of February 26, 1976, Cr. 609-IN) provided the funds for a feasibility study,
completed in November 1979, for the establishment of a saw-wood mill and a



- 17 -
pulp factory based on the forest resources of southeastern MP. The MP Agricul-
tural Extension and Research Project (US$10.0 M credit of June 1, 1977, Cr.
712-IN) is designed to strengthen agricultural supporting services, particu-
larly extension and research in MP. Staff shortages, especially in super-
visory and managerial posts, have delayed implementation of the extension
component, but results in areas where regular extension visits are being made
attest to the effectiveness of the extension system under the project.  MP
is also benefitting from two India-wide projects, the ARDC II and III Projects
(Credits 715-IN and 947-IN, respectively).
V. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
5.01      The objectives of the project are to improve the performance of
investments in MIPs in the State, through the introduction of new planning,
design, construction and operational criteria. These citeria are aimed at
increasing the reliability and timeliness of water deliveries to the farm-
gate, a prerequisite for successful irrigated agriculture. Experience in MP
and other States has shown that without the confidence that they will receive
irrigation in accordance with plant requirements, farmers are unlikely to
make the necessary complementary investments in on-farm development, improved
inputs, and better management to justify the planned investments in irrigation
infrastructure.
Project Formulation
5.02      The project was identified by GOMP and IDA, and has been prepared
in cooperation with the Central Water Commission (CWC) of GOI. Similar to
the Orissa and Gujarat Sector Credits (Credit Nos. 740-IN and 808-IN, respec-
tively), the proposed project would consist of a five-year line of credit made
available to GOMP for financing MIPs throughout the State. The credit would
finance all or part of the construction, over a five-year period, of medium
irrigation projects throughout the State, with a combined service area of
about 107,000 ha; 1/ in addition it would include:
(a) Provision of equipment to improve the hydrological data base
for the planning of future major and medium projects;
(b) Monitoring and evaluation studies;
(c) A water management component which would experiment with
selective improvements in the infrastructure and manage-
ment of four existing MIPs;
1/   Expressed in terms of fully-financed areas; however, the number partially
financed will be higher, as some projects are already under construction,
and others will be completed after the five-year period.



- 18 -
(d) Training of management staff;
(e) Technical services for the planning layout and design
of the distribution system; and
(f) Demonstration farms for irrigated agriculture.
Medium Irrigation Projects
5.03      Under the proposed project, medium irrigation projects (MIPs) would
encompass cultivable command areas of 2,000 to 15,000 ha. Each MIP would
be composed of:
(a) a storage dam with spillway;
(b) a fully lined canal network which would deliver water
to outlets serving 5-8 ha blocks;
(c) unlined field channels to the 2 ha operating unit; and
(d) a drainage network connecting to natural drains.
Typically, in non-paddy projects in an average year, about 50%-80% of the
command area would be irrigated in kharif and 50%-80% in rabi. Paddy projects
would be 100% irrigated in kharif and 30%-40% in rabi. The average cost would
be about Rs 14,000 (US$1,670) per ha of net cultivable command area (net CCA).
Typically, the dam accounts for about 60% of the cost of an MIP and the con-
veyance and drainage networks together for about 40%. The cost of MIPs are
somewhat higher than the cost per ha for major irrigation schemes designed
to similar standards, 1/ however, MIPs have shorter gestation periods and,
thus, yield quicker benefits. The salient features and the cost breakdown for
three typical MIPs are given in Volume II, Appendices 1-3.
Criteria for Medium Irrigation Projects
5.04        Basic data requirements, specific criteria for planning, design
and construction, and a minimum level of economic viability have been esta-
blished for MIPs eligible for disbursement under the credit. An agreement
has been reached with GOI and GOMP that MIPs financed under the IDA credit
would be designed, constructed and completed in accordance with requirements
and criteria detailed in Annex 1.
5.05        Feasibility investigations for appraisal would be based on:  (a)
a soil survey and land irrigability classification; (b) a socio-economic
1/   The distribution networks are slightly costlier in major projects, but
this is more than offset by the economies of scale in dam construction;
the per ha cost of dams is significantly lower than in MIPs. Generally,
the dam accounts for one-third and the distribution network for two-
thirds of the cost in major projects.

survey to provide a basis for future agriculLural, social and ecornomic plan-
ning; (c) an agricultural development plan to project likely future crop-
ping patterns and future input requirements; and (d) estimates of monthly
runoff based on stream gauging records and rainfall/runoff correlations used
in a reservoir operation study. Crop water requirements for the projected
cropping pattern would be calculated according to FAO Irrigation and Drainage
Paper No. 24 (using the modified Penman method of calculating ETOs). A
fortnightly irrigation water requirement would be developed using actual
recorded rainfall in the project command area or nearby stations for a period
of at least 20 years. Water requirements for paddy would include allowance
for land preparation and percolation.  Maximum field irrigation and canal
conveyance efficiencies to be used are shown in Annex 1, Table 1. Maximum
overall efficiencies 1/ for the proposed design, construction and operational
standards are 55% and 42% for kharif paddy and non-paddy crops, respectively,
and 58% for rabi crops. The size of the command area and the live storage
capacity of the reservoir would be such that full kharif irrigation require-
ments would be met in at least three years out of four. The average area to
be irrigated in the rabi season would be established through a 20-year reser-
voir operation study. Summaries of three sample reservoir operation studies
are given in Volume II, Appendices 1-3. Sediment accumulation throughout the
reservoir over 50 years would be provided for in setting the canal diversion
elevation from the reservoir.
5.06        Design Criteria:  (a) Surveys:  The ID's standard procedures and
methods, which are acceptable to IDA, should be followed for the reservoir,
damsite and main conveyance system. Detailed surveys should be made on sample
areas in order to plan and cost typical layouts of the minor distribution
system; (b) Drainage: A full drainage system would be planned; and (c)
Irrigation System. The ID would layout, design and construct a lined distri-
bution system from the dam to 5-8 ha outlets, and unlined field channels to
individual farm or 2 ha operating units if the farm size under the outlet
requires it. The distribution system would be designed to deliver at least
one cusec of water at the 8 ha outlet on a rotational basis. The main canal
system would be designed with the necessary structures to permit full irriga-
tion deliveries at offtakes when flowing at 50% design capacity. Measurement
devices would be 'provided at the head of the main supply channels, at the
offtaking channel and at each one cusec outlet. Public access should be
provided to the project and throughoutl the command area and a modern communi-
cation system provided. (d) Dams would be constructed according to standards
which would meet basic requirements for: (i) safety against overtopping; (ii)
stability; (iii) safety against internal erosion; and (iv) safety against
surface erosion.
Dam Safety
5.07      To ensure the safety of the dams of MIPs submitted for financing
under the Credit, a panel of experts would be constituted by GOMP to under-
take periodic and comprehensive reviews of plans, designs and construction of
the dams and associated structures as well as to review the operation, main-
tenance and safety procedures to be used after their construction. An agree-
ment has been reached with GOMP that it would establish a Dam Review Panel
with terms of reference (Annex 7) and qualifications acceptable to IDA.
1/   Between the dam and the plant.



- A0 -
5.08      The Panel's role should not be viewed as one of assisting or guiding
the ID, since responsibility for proper design and construction, including
quality control, rests with GOMP. Rather it should be considered as a review
body of technical experts whose judgement and opinions on particular technical
matters would carry considerable weight in the evaluation of proposed actions
by the project administration. The Panel would submit a written report con-
taining their review, comments, and recommendations within 60 days following
each convening of the Panel by GOMPo Te report should be made available to
IDA for review and to such bodies within the Government of India which may be
assigned safety-of-dam responsibilities,
5.09      After construction, GOMP would undertake periodic inspection of the
dams and associated structures to review their conditions as well as the ade-
quacy of operation and maintenance.  An agreement has been reached with GOMP
that it would make arrangements acceptable to the Association to ensure dam
safety after construction period.
5.10        Implementation Criteria:  (a) Construction practices would follow
sound engineering practices and adequate quality control would follow laid
down procedures and standards.  "b) Construction of an MIP would be scheduled
for completion within five years or less. The irrigation, drainage system and
road network would be constructed concurrently with the dam. A commissioning
period of at least one year would be introduced, to facilitate an efficient
transition from the construction phase to the operational phase. Implementa-
tion schedules for 3 sample MIPs are given in Volume II, Appendices 1-3.
5.11      Operational Criteria:  (a) Water deliveries to the farmers would
be on a rotational basis initially, in accordance with seasonal schedules
established for the rabi season. Rotational water supply (RWS) would be
introduced in the kharif season taking into account the variable rainfall.
(b) A farmer would be notified of his allocation of water at the start of the
rabi season, taking into account cropping pattern demand, size of holding and
soil conditions. (c) The canal system would be closed each year for an
appropriate period for maintenance. (d) Adequate financial provisions
would be made for efficient operation, maintenance and operation of each
sub-project. (e) Adequate provision would be made for the supply of inputs,
marketing and processing of production. and agricultural supporting services.
5.12      Maintenance and Management of the System (paras 6.14-6.17).  The
responsibility for the physical maintenance of the whole system down to the
last Government turnout (approximately 8 ha) would rest with the Irrigation
Department (ID). The operation of the entire system down to 8 ha turnout
would also rest with ID until the -hole MIP is fully comissioned and developed.
This period would take a minimum of two years following completion of construc-
tion. The ID would appoint a project manager to maintain and manage each MIP;
after the two-year commissioning period, the Project Manager could be appointed
from appropriately qualified staff of the AD. However, responsibility for
physical maintenance of the system would remain with the ID. Project Managers
would also be responsible for preparing and submitting full reports relating
to water consumption and agricultural production.



- 21 -
5.13      Resettlement.  Prior to the appraisal of each MIP, GOMP would pro-
vide a comprehensive resettlement plan (including an implementation schedule)
for the relocation of residents in the reservoir area. In addition, GOMP is
currently formulating comprehensive legislation to safeguard the interests of
the affected residents, and is in the process of establishing an appropriate
organizational framework to execute its relocation pn'icies. The legislation
would ensure that landholders from the submergence area would be provided with
irrigated land in or near the command area, or with land immediately adjacent
to the reservoir (if they prefer to stay near their previous residence); they
would be compensated at replacement value for the loss of household and
community assets where these are not already provided in the new location.
Also, those owning land but not living in the submergence area, would be
similarly compensated.
5.14      Cost Estimates.  uost es, .aces for each MIP would be based on bid
prices prevailing in the region in which the project D located, at the time
of submission of the project to CWC. The estimate of project cost would
include the cost of land acquisition and resettlement of farmers displaced due
to the project and other items which the Bank does not disburse against. A
physical contingency factor of at least 15% of the c.  zruction cost should
be included in the project estimate. Where work has reached the tendering or
construction phase a lower contingency of not less than 10% can be used.
Establishment charges at the rate of 15% of the cost, including physical
contingencies but excluding the cost of land and equipment, would be provided
in the estimates. Expenditure schedules for three sample MIPs are given in
Volume II, Appendices 1-3.
5.15       Economic Criteria (Annex 6).  The project- aDproved would yield an
economic rate of return of at least 12%. 1/ Project benefits are based on the
expected value of water in each agro-ecological zone, and adjusted to include
the effects of discounting, and of different construction periods and benefit
build-up rates. From these calculations, maximum permissible capital costs
(in financial terms) have been developea '_r zach zone, and for different con-
struction periods. The Appraisal Committee (AC) would use these to evaluate
the economic viability of each subproject.
Flow Monitoring (Annex 5)
5.16      In order to improve the hydrological data base for the planning of
medium irrigation projects dispersed throughout the ^-^-climatic areas of the
state, stream flow gauging stations will be established for new and ongoing
MIPs. Local consulting services and equipment would oe provided; the consul-
ting services would be financed from the Technical S'--ices Component.
Water Management Areas (Annex 4)
5.17      In order to experiment with improved water management systems, water
management areas (WMAs) would be set up in four repr --tative existing MIPs
in typical agro-climatic zones.  Two WMAs of about 20n ha each would be
1/   The estimated opportunity cost of capital in India.



- 22 -
selected in each project; one of these would be modernized to the standards to
be applied in new IDA-financed MIPs (Annex 1), the other would have minimum
improvements made to the existing physical system. The ID will experiment with
RWS and other water allocation procedures in WMAs constructed to the new
standards and compare the results with those from WMAs which have had only the
"'minimum" improvements over the existing standards.
Training (para 6.19)
5.18      This component would represent a first stage of training for the
management of irrigation projects in MP, and could provide the basis for the
establishment of a larger-scale training institute at a later date. The
training component fund would provide for the cost of classroom courses and
field visits to operating projects in MP and other States for workshops/semi-
nars run by specialists/consultants; and for audiovisual equipment for use in
the classrooms (see Table T-10).
Technical Services
5.19      In its Sixth Plan, GOMP has committed itself to a significant
increase in irrigation investments, consistent with the priorities in both
State and National Plans. These commitments include large inter-State pro-
jects--particularly in the Narmada Basin--as well as the Major Composite
Project, also likely to be IDA-financed. This situation, combined with the
fact that the Project Preparation and Monitoring (PPM) Cells in the ID and AD
are in their infancy, will place a heavy burden on existing ID staff and may
delay project implementation. Experience in MP as well as elsewhere in India
indicates that constraints in implementation generally occur in the completion
of the distribution system networks. Funds have therefore been provided for
COMP to hire engineering consultants to assist it in the planning, layout
and design of the distribution systems of MIPs included in the Project. Their
engagement would: (i) increase the implementation capacity of the ID; and
(ii) afford an opportunity for improvements in survey, layout and design. An
agreement has been reached with GOMP that it would engage consultants with
terms of reference and qualifications acceptable to IDA.
Demonstration Farms
5.20      Four demonstration farms (one in each major river-basin, of about 10
ha each) would be set up under the project. They would be situated near IDA-
financed MIPs, representative of the major crop zone in which it is located.
The focus of activities would be to test improved crop varieties for local
adaptability, and to organize the demonstration of improved agricultural
practices under irrigated conditions.
Monitoring and Evaluation
2.21      There would be a need to monitor and evaluate the costs and benefits
associated with the improved design, construction and operational standards
inttoduced under the credit. For this purpose: (a) the Project Manager would
submit a seasonal report (Volume II, Appendix 4) to the ID PPM Cell; (b) the



- 23 -
ID and AD PPM cells would be strengthened; (c) ID would monitor canal/con-
veyance efficiencies in selected projects and make a comparative study of
conveyance losses in unlined and lined canal systems; and (d) GOMP's Direc-
torate of Economics and Statistics would prepare an evaluation of MIPs
financed under the credit three years after the first water delivery and
would utilize, inter alia, the bench mark agro-economic surveys undertaken
prior to construction of a MIP. These studies would form the basis for a
project completion report prepared by GOMP. CWC would also monitor these
projects through the reporting system described in Volume II, Appendix 4.
Project Costs
5.22      The proposed project would support a five-year time-slice of MP's
medium irrigation program. The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed against
expenditures on MIPs, designed and constructed in accordance with the agreed
criteria (Annex 1), incurred during the 1981/82-1985/86 project period. MIPs
under construction 1/ and MIPs started in 1981/82 would be completed in the
five-year project period, while MIPs started in 1982/83 or later would be
financed only up to 1985/86.
5.23      Total project cost, including a negligible amount of taxes and
duties, would be about Rs 1,950 M (US$232.1 M), with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of Rs 334 M (US$39.8 M), or about 17% of the total cost. Price con-
tingencies have been estimated at about 19% of the project cost based on
expected inflation rates of 7% from 1981/82 to 1983/84 and 5% from 1984/85
to 1985/86.

Financing
5.24      The proposed IDA credit of SDRs 112.6 M (US$140.0 M) would finance
the foreign exchange component (US$39.8 M) and about 52% of local cost or
about 60% of total project cost. All infrastructure works would be financed
from GOMP's development budget, which would include a GOI contribution. An
agreement has been reached with GOI that it would make the proceeds of the
credit available to GOMP on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for develop-
ment assistance to the States. In addition, an assurance has been obtained
from GOMP that it would promptly provide the funds to implement and complete
IDA-financed MIP works in accordance with the schedule of expenditures (Table
T-12); and that it would, after the credit has been disbursed, complete the
MIPs as soon as technically and financially feasible. IDA would exchange
views annually with GOMP on the implementation program for construction of
MIPs.
Procurement
5.25      Civil Works financed under the project would cost approximately
US$128 M, excluding physical contingencies, price increases, engineering
and administrative costs. The works would be relatively small and scattered
over the State in 25-30 schemes. Each scheme has a small dam, main canals,
distribution and drainage networks, some roads and a few small buildings. The
dams and main canals would be packaged to attract competition from the larger
contractors, yet allow awards to be made on individual schedules to promote
the interest of small contractors--i.e., contractors would be permitted to
tender for all or parts of a package. LCB would follow procedures developed
by the Central Water Commission and approved by IDA. Some of the small works,
not to exceed 40% of the total works, would be procured under small unit price
or percentage rate contracts. These two types of contracts have been reviewed
by IDA and found acceptable for the small works. Departmental works would be
used only when required for safety or quality considerations, and limited to
10% of all works. About US$3 M worth of remaining work on LCB contracts let
after September 1980 in accordance with IDA procurement guidelines would be
eligible for financing under the Project.
5.26      Equipment and Vehicles (Table T-ll) financed under the project would
cost about US$8.6 M excluding price contingencies. All equipment and vehicles
would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Association since
they are light and their smooth operation depends largely on the availability
of local existing servicing and spare parts facilities. All items will be
conveniently grouped to promote efficiency and attract larger suppliers; how-
ever, awards will also be accepted on individual schedules to promote competi-
tion from small suppliers.
Disbursements
5.27      Disbursements would be made for:  (a) 70% of expenditures for civil
works on approved MIPs; (b) 100% for locally manufactured goods procured
ex-factory; (c) 70% for other locally procured goods; and (d) 100% for techni-
cal assistance. Disbursements for force account work and for payments of less
than Rs 300,000 under civil works contracts and Rs 150,000 for equipment and



- 25 -
vehicles would be made against certificates of expenditure--itemized by sub-
project--submitted by GOMP. Documentation for these works would be retained
by GOMP and made available for inspection by IDA during review missions. Full
documentation would be required for all other disbursements. The estimated
schedule of expenditure, the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
and the semi-annual disbursement schedule are presented in Tables T-12 to
T-14. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by March 31, 1987.
Accounts and Audits
5.28      The project would be subject to normal Government control and
auditing procedures which are satisfactory. A resident Audit Officer, repre-
senting the State Accountant General (AG) would audit the project accounts.
Although continuous and annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the
finalization is a lengthy process of the Statutory Audit Report presented to
the Legislature. It would be essential therefore to have interim certified
statements of account. Such statements certified by the AG or his designee
supported by an itemized account and a summary of expenditures would be sub-
mitted to IDA as soon as possible after the end of each fiscal year. Agree-
ments were reached with GOMP that it would:  (a) maintain separate accounts
on MIP expenditures; (b) ensure that these accounts would be audited annually
by the AG and the resulting interim statements of account would be submitted
to IDA as soon as possible but not later than nine months after the end of each
fiscal year; and (c) make complete accounts and financial statements available
for inspection during IDA review missions, and (d) ensure that sufficient
auditing staff would be made available for this purpose.
Environmental Effects
5.29      The main water-related diseases in Madhya Pradesh are malaria and
typhoid. The construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals
would minimize areas of stagnating water which are suitable breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. Also, borrow pits excavated in the course of project imple-
mentation would be drained. Under these conditions, it is not expected that
the incidence of malaria and typhoid would increase due to project works.
Because the MIPs are relatively small and spread throughout the State, it is
not expected that the use of fertilizers and pesticides will have a signifi-
cant environmental impact. An agreement was reached with GOMP that it would
take all measures as considered necessary to minimize the risk of malaria and
other water-related diseases in areas covered by MIPs financed under the
credit.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      The ID is responsible for planning, design, construction and main-
tenance of irrigation projects all over the State, and is headed by an Engineer-
in-Chief (E-in-C) who reports to the Secretary of Irrigation (see Organization
Chart C-i). The E-in-C is assisted by 11 Chief Engineers (CEs) who also
report directly to the Secretary Irrigation. Of the eleven CEs, four CEs are
responsible for the construction and O&M of MIPs in their respective basins,



- 26 -
four others are responsible for the construction and O&M of major projects in
the State. One CE is responsible for surveys, planning and investigation of
major projects in the State. One CE is responsible for groundwater irrigation.
Another CE looks after all the electrical and mechanical units and installa-
tions including heavy earth moving machinery.
6.02      The ID is organized in four major river basins--viz, Chambal-Betwa,
Narmada-Tapti, Ganga and Mahanadi-Godavari. Under each basin CE are several
circles, each headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE). The SE is generally
responsible for three to five Divisions, each headed by an Executive Engineer
(EE). A Division in turn consists of three to five sub-divisions which are
under the control of an Assistant Engineer (AE).
6.03      Recently, a PPM Cell has been set up under the control of E-in-C.
This Cell would be responsible for the planning and preparation of each MIP
to be financed under the credit.
The Appraisal Committee of the Central Water Commission
6.04      The Central Water Commission (CWC) of GOI is the highest technical
authority for water resources development in India. The Commission consists
of a Chairman and four members. It has a staff of more than 1,000 engineers;
part of the staff is on deputation from the States.
6.05      The CWC prepares guidelines for the design and construction of
irrigation projects and is responsible for technical review of all major
and medium projects before they are submitted for approval by the Planning
Commission of GOI. To date, in the case of medium irrigation projects, the
review is only proforma. The CWC usually is actively involved in the planning
of large projects of high national importance. Recently, CWC established a
Central Monitoring Organization, which continuously follows the implementation
of selected major projects; a Dam Safety Unit has also been set up. The CWC
is also sometimes directly responsible for the planning and implementation of
federally sponsored schemes.
6.06      The CWC would be responsible for appraising and reviewing the pro-
gress of MIPs financed under the credit. An Appraisal Committee (AC) has
already been set up for appraising the Orissa Irrigation Project (Cr. 740-IN)
and the Gujarat Irrigation Project (808-IN). The AC is headed by the Member,
Planning and Progress, of CWC. The Committee's staff presently consists of
a Director, six engineers, two agriculturalists and one economist. The AC
has completed the appraisal of 11 MIPs in Orissa and 9 MIPs in Gujarat and
has submitted 20 Project Summaries to IDA for approval. 1/ The progress of
CWC's appraisal and review work has been satisfactory. During implemenation
of the proposed project, the workload of AC would increase and, thus, CWC
would gradually increase AC's staff based on the following staffing coeffi-
cients: 24-32 staff weeks per MIP appraisal and 18 staff weeks per MIP
1/   Under the Orissa and Gujarat Irrigation Projects, CWC is authorized to
approve MIPs costing less than Rs 70 M.



- 27 -
per year for progress review during implementation. These staffing coeffi-
cients would be reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted, based on experience
gained during project implementation,
Procedures for Medium Irrigation Projects
6.07      There would be a continuous interaction between AC and GOMP during
the implementation of MIPs. The main activities in the "project cycle" would
follow procedures described below:
6.08      Project Identification.  The overall strategy for irrigation devel-
opment in MP will generally conform to the master plan already framed for
the Godavari Basin (1974), and the Narmada Basin (1965), and master plans
under various stages of formation in respect of Chambal-Betwa, Ganga, Tapi-
Mahi and Mahanadi Basins. The initial investigations are carried out by the
Executive Engineer (EE) who prepares a reconnaissance survey report. This
purely engineering report, which gives an indication of the technical feasi-
bility of the project and outlines the requirements for detailed investiga-
tions, provides the basis for a decision about a full scale investigation
program. The investigation and preparation priorities of MIPs are established
by the basin CE.
6.09      Project Preparation.  Detailed hydrological, geological and soil
investigations for project preparation would be carried out by the local ID
staff, coordinated by the PPM Cell, with support from central ID and AD staff
(for the soil surveys), and the Geological Survey of India. These investiga-
tions would form the basis for preparation of project reports to be prepared
according to the design criteria agreed between GOMP and IDA (Annex 1). The
draft project preparation report will be finalized in the PPM Cell of the ID
to ensure that it has been prepared in accordance with agreed design criteria,
and also to ensure a uniform approach in project preparation and cost esti-
mates. The progress of MIP preparation would be reviewed every six months by
the AC to ensure the implementation of established criteria for planning and
preparation.
6.10      Submission of Project to CWC.  After approval by the PPM Cell, the
MIPs would be included in GOMP's annual development plan to be reviewed by
the Planning Commission of GOI. Subsequent to GOI approval of the plan,
the selected MIPs would be submitted to CWC for appraisal.
6.11      Project Appraisal.  The AC would visit the sub-project area to
review the proposed sub-project in detail and ascertain that the proposed MIP
meets the agreed criteria (Annex 1). The AC would also ensure that: the
designs are technically sound, with special emphasis given to the safety of
the dam, and other highlighted areas; the proposed cropping pattern is suit-
able for the command area; agricultural supporting services are adequate; and
the cost estimates and implementation schedule are realistic. The AC would
confirm and adjust the project proposal as necessary and prepare a Project
Summary, which would be submitted to IDA. Field appraisal for projects with
a command area larger than 10,000 ha would be carried out with full partici-
pation of IDA, but responsibility for preparation of Project Summaries would
remain with AC.



- 28 -
6.12      Project Approval.  The AC would be authorized to approve sub-projects
that meet the technical criteria and cost less than Rs 100 M (US$11.9 M)
excluding price contingencies if the benefit/cost ratio is higher than 1.0.
In all other cases, sub-projects would be reviewed by IDA which would base
its decision on an analysis of Project Reports and Summaries (Volume II,
Appendix 4), supplemented by field visits, if necessary. It is expected that
about 40% of the eligible MIPs representing about 60% of the IDA financed
investment programs, would be subject to detailed IDA review and approval.
6.13      Project Implementation.  The ID would be responsible for the imple-
mentation of all irrigation works. Each MIP would be implemented by four or
five sub-divisions that would be technically and administratively controlled
by the divisional EE. Agreements have been reached with GOMP that: (a) the
AD would provide necessary guidance to the farmers on the lay-out of farm
channels and other related on-farm works, through its extension staff; (b) the
AD would maintain staffing of its agricultural extension services in each MIP
area in accordance with standards which have been agreed with IDA (the
Agricultural Extension and Research Project Cr. 712-IN, 1977, US$10 M); and
(c) in order to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture, GOMP would, where
required, strengthen the credit, input supply, storage and marketing facili-
ties that serve the MIP areas. The PPM Cell would continuously monitor the
progress of project implementation to ensure that all necessary actions are
taken by concerned departments. Progress of project implementation would be
reviewed by AC during each construction season.
Maintenance and Management of the System
6.14      Each MIP would be managed by one full-time project manager.  The
Irrigation Department would retain responsibility for the physical maintenance
of the irrigation system, from the dam down to the 5-8 ha outlet.
6.15      After the completion of construction and during the initial period
of project development, the project manager would be of at least assistant
engineer grade with a minimum of three months training in water management
provided by the ID. Subordinate staff would also receive training in water
management. The Project manager would be responsible for ensuring timely
reliable and equitable deliveries of water to the 8 ha outlets. In assessing
the scheduling of water deliveries he would be assisted by the AD's existing
extension (T&V) staff including subject matter specialist (SMS) in water
management. The AD officers would also coordinate with the Project Manager to
ensure the timely provision of inputs and credit, and would advise farmers on
water management. The existing District Water Utilization Committee (WUC)
chaired by the Collector would act as a review body.
6.16      After the project has been fully developed, a new Project Manager
could be appointed from either the ID or the AD; in either case, he will have
received suitable training in water management. From the time of first water
deliveries, the Project Manager, in cooperation with his AD or ID equivalent
would submit a seasonal report--which would focus on the agricultural produc-
tioix aspects of project performance--to the WUC and to the PPM Cells of the ID
and the AD. CWC would use this report as part of its progress performance
review submitted to IDA.



- 29 -
6.17      Most system maintenance would take place during the non-irrigation
season (March to May) with the use of temporarily hired labor or small unit
price contractors. The gate keepers are responsible for routine maintenance
during the irrigation season. An agreement has been reached with GOMP that
it would provide adequate funds to operate and maintain all project works
in accordance with sound engineering standards.
Operation of the System
6.18      Water deliveries to the farmers would initially be on a rotational
basis in accordance with schedules established for the rabi and hot weather
seasons; GOMP would examine how rotational deliveries can be introduced during
the kharif season when rainfall is subject to significant variations. Before
the start of each irrigation season, each farmer would be notified of his
allocation of water for the forthcoming season and when the supply would be
made available to him. The allocation would be based on: (i) the seasonal
availability of water; (ii) cropping pattern and the calculated water demand
for this pattern for the minor/distributary under which he is located; (iii)
the size of his holdings; and (iv) soil conditions. The canal would be closed
for maintenance for an appropriate period which would be determined with
reference to the cropping pattern and publicized well in advance.
Training
6.19      The type of training provided by this component would be largely
practical and field-oriented, and concentrated initially over a relatively
short period (3-4 months). Four categories of staff would receive training:
(a) Trainers of Project Managers: two or three trainers would
be selected to take a short course (six months or so) at
Roorkee University in Uttar Pradesh;
(b) Project Managers: (engineering graduates with at least
one year's field experience of operating and maintaining
a project). Project managers would require at least
three months training prior to appointment. They would
spend about one month at the Administrative College in
Bhopal receiving training on such topics as the calcula-
tion of crop water requirements; reservoir operation; the
scheduling of water deliveries, (and how to modify them
according to prevailing climatic conditions); record keep-
ing for the Project Manager's seasonal report to the ID's
PPM Cell, etc. They would then spend about two months on
existing MIPs in or outside the State, under an experienced
project manager;
(c) Subordinate Project Management Staff. (Engineering diplomas,
with at least one year's experience on the operation of a
MIP): courses for these would be shorter than for the
Project Managers (1-2 months), with a greater emphasis on
field training. The content of the training, would however,
be similar to that for the Managers; and



- 30 -
(d) PPM Cell Staff would receive courses and visits similar
to the Project Managers, supplemented by visits to irri-
gation schemes outside India, where appropriate.
Training courses would be conducted by ID staff at the Administrative College
in Bhopal and would be supplemented by a series of workshops and seminars to
be conducted by visiting specialists and/or consultants. Agricultural Depart-
ment Staff would also participate in the courses as and when appropriate.
Progress Review and Reporting Requirements
6.20      Progress review and reporting requirements, which have been agreed
with CWC, are designed to: (a) ensure that the projects are designed, appraised
and implemented in accordance with the agreed critiera; (b) ensure that work
for which disbursements are requested actually has been carried out; (c) pro-
vide information to allow better project preparation and appraisal in the
future; (d) provide guidance for the AC staff in its review of project pro-
gress; (e) develop channels for mutual exchange of experience between IDA, CWC
and GOMP staff; and (vi) provide early warning signals to IDA if problems are
developing in the implementation of the MIPs.
6.21      The following reports would be prepared by the AC:
(a)  As "Annual Implementation Program" would be prepared after
a review, with the GOMP officials of projects under pre-
paration and implementation. Special attention would be
given to budgetary allocation for each sub-project in order
to ensure that adequate funds would be provided in accor-
dance with agreed implementation schedules.
(b)  A "Progress Summary:  Preparation" would be prepared after
each visit to the Divisional Office where a sub-project is
being prepared and preferably to the project site. Progress
of sub-project preparation would be reviewed every six months.
(c)  A "Progress Summary:  Implementation" would be prepared and
updated three times during each construction season, after
visits to the MIP site.
(d)  A "Progress Summary:  Operation" would be prepared once
a year after a visit to the completed project to assess
irrigation benefits and to review the quality and effec-
tiveness of O&M. This would be based on a seasonal project
report and submitted by each project manager to the ID's
PPM Cell.
6.22      The first five MIPs submitted for AC's appraisal would also be
reviewed by IDA. The main thrust of IDA review would be to: (a) assess the
quality of AC's appraisal and review work; (b) spot check whether agreed
criteria have been followed (in particular, IDA would examine closely any
major divergences between the indicative zonal cropping pattern, and the
pattern projected for the MIP); (c) review procurement procedures; (d) check



- 31 -
the financial records kept by GOI and GOMP; (e) assess the appropriateness of
established criteria; and (f) examine the contents and timing of reports
submitted by CWC.
Cost Recovery
6.23      Capital and O&M Costs.  The investment cost for MIPs would amount to
about Rs 14,400 per ha of net CCA (including on-farm development). The cost
of the system between the dam and the 2 ha operating unit would be financed by
GOMP; the cost of on-farm development (land levelling, internal farm channels
and drains, etc.) is estimated at Rs 400/ha of net CCA and would be financed
directly by the farmers or through institutional sources (refinanced by ARDC).
The 10-year repayment schedule includes a 2-year grace period. Annual O&M
costs are estimated at Rs 100/ha. Annual financial requirement for recovery
of all these costs (excluding OFD) is estimated at Rs 1,510/ha of net CCA:

6.24      Water and Water Related Charges.  At present, the prime vehicle for
recovery of capital and 0&M costs for irrigation works is the water charge.
GOMP has a policy of reviewing and revising the water charge every two or
three years. The rates have recently been reviewed, and an increase of about
250% on average (for the proposed cropping patterns) has been recommended.
GOMP is likely to come to a decision during the next few months on the new
rates to be adopted. The current rates are:
Crop                              Rate (Rs/ha)
Paddy                                        40
Other kharif foodgrains                      25
Wheat                                        37
Pulses                                       30
Rabi Maize                                   40
Groundnuts (kharif)                          30
Cotton                                       80
Sugarcane (12 months)                       100
6.25      For the average projected cropping pattern of the MIPs (weighted by
each zone), the water rate would average about Rs 52/ha of net CCA.  In
addition, a cess is recovered from the total irrigable command at a rate of
Rs 12/ha, and a tax is levied on land growing commercial crops, at the rate of
Rs 10/ha on land growing sugarcane and tobacco, and of Rs 5/ha in the case of
cotton and groundnut. The total of the rates, cess and tax would average
Rs 68/ha of net CCA.



- 32 -
6.26      The MP Irrigation Act 1/ provides for collection of a betterment
levy from farmers benefitting from irrigation works. However, the levy has
yet to be collected.
6.27      Other Agricultural Taxes. 1/  Since incomes in the agricultural
sector are much lower than in the manufacturing and service sectors, the rate
of agricultural taxation is relatively modest. More important from a revenue
point of view is the agricultural sales tax which is levied on agricultural
produce at the following rates:
Crop         Rate
Foodgrains       3%
Pulses           5%
Oilseeds         4-1/2%
Vegetables       6%
Vegetables       6%
It is estimated that GOMP's revenues from the agricultural sales tax would
increase by Rs 98 per ha brought under irrigation from an MIP, or by a total
of Rs 10.4 M over all MIPs. In addition, GOMP would get significant additional
revenues from taxes levied on agricultural processing industries.
6.28      Level of Cost Recovery.  Considering all the water and water-related
charges collected at present and the automatic increase in revenues from
agricultural sales taxes, GOMP's annual revenue would amount to about Rs 166/
ha of net CCA.  Thus, GOMP would recover 11% of the annual capital and O&M
costs, which would rise to about 18% if the proposed increase in water rates
is implemented.
6.29      Farmers' Ability to Pay Water Charges.  For the assessment of
farmers' ability to pay water charges, the "project rent" has been estimated.
The project rent is equal to net incremental farm income less the necessary
rewards to the farm family for its labor, entrepreneurship and cultivation
risk. The project rent has been analyzed for the "average" farm, weighted
by agro-ecological zone (Table T-18). At full development in the late 1990s,
the project rent for MIPs is estimated at about Rs 910/ha, which would give
a rent recovery index of 18% if the water rates remain unchanged. However,
with the proposed increase in water rates, this would rise to about 30%.
Even though about two-thirds of the expected beneficiaries presently have
incomes below the poverty level, their incomes would increase by 320% as
a result of the construction of the MIPs (para 7.05). Thus, there would
appear to be scope for a significant increase in the water related charges.
6.30      The principal reason for the current low rates is that there are
not only large variations in the benefits accruing from different projects
but also between different farmers in the same project. In view of the

and Finances," (Draft) by Christine Wallich, October 1979.

difficulties of assessing the benefits to each individual farmer, the general
policy in India is to charge a uniform water rate. It has been observed in
the older projects, that the water supply to most tail-end farmers is highly
unreliable and their benefits fromn "irrigation" are fairly low. Consequently,
water rates have to be set at a low level in order to give the tail-end far-
mers sufficient incentive to use irrigation water, even though the "average"
farmer would be able to pay substantially higher charges.
6.31      However, the technical standards introduced under the credit are
specifically designed to ensure that each farmer in the command area receives
a reliable water supply, so that the benefits to the individual farmer, inclu-
ding those at the tail-end, would be higher and more secure. There is, there-
fore, likely to be a justification for collecting higher charges from the
farmers benefitting from the construction of MIPs. GOMP would monitor the
success of MIPs in providing timely and reliable supplies of water to all
farmers in the command, and their reactions to the new standards. On the
basis of these studies, GOMP would: (i) review the water and water-related
charges in the State by December 31, 1983; and (ii) after paying due regard to
IDA's comments, and as soon as possible, implement a system of charges that
would ensure recovery of annual O&M costs and, to the extent possible, cost of
infrastructure investments.  In establishing the level of charges, due consi-
deration would be given to the incentives and payment capacity of farmers. An
agreement to this effect has been reached with GOMP.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION 1/
General
7.01      The proposed credit would assist in expanding the area under irri-
gation in MP. Through these means, it would increase the production of food-
grains, oilseeds, spices, long staple cotton and garden crops, and would
provide additional year-round employment opportunities to landless laborers
and small farmers. The provision of irrigation in low rainfall areas would
reduce the risk of drought and famine.
7.02      As a result of the improvements in timeliness and reliabilty of
irrigation supplies introduced as part of the project, it is expected that
future irrigated yields will be significantly higher than the yields in exis-
ting irrigation projects. However, these estimates are conservative compared
with irrigated yields in other States, and compared with the potential that
could be achieved under these conditions.
7.03      Organizational arrangements introduced under the credit would
strengthen local capabilities for project planning, design and implementa-
tion and, thus, lead to a general improvement in the technical and economic
viability of all projects in the irrigation sector.
1/ The methodology for the economic analysis, including the assumptions
regarding prices, yields, input requirements, the derived crop and farm
budgets-economic benefits and economic justification for lining, are given
in Annex 6.

7.04      The overall impact of IDA supported works can be summarized as
follows:
Directly benefitting farm families (nos): 29,700
Increase in irrigated area (ha): 107,000
Increased foodgrain production (tons): 238,800
Increased foodgrain production (Rs): 336 M
Increased cash-crop production (Rs): 120 M
Value added to the local economy (Rs): 290 M
Generated farm employment (manyears): 22,800
Generated non-farm employment (manyears): 8,900
Income Effects
7.05      At present, some 70% of MP's farmers have no access to irrigation.
The lack of irrigation facilities is the major constraint facing these farmers.
Once this constraint is removed, net farm incomes would increase by about
320%. The estimated income effects of the project are:

/a Equal to the average farm size for MP.
Economic Rate of Return
7.06      The average economic rate of return (ERR) on the three sample MIPs
which have been prepared is 18%; since these have been selected as typical of
the three major agro-climatic divisions of the State, it is likely that the
average ERR for the whole project will be around 18%. Although the AC would
be authorized to approve any project with a rate of return equal to or greater
than 12%, economic inefficiency in project design is constrained by the fixed
parameters (Annex 1) given for the benefits; for the project efficiency and
water requirements; for irrigation intensity (between 120% and 140%); and for
the indicative zonal cropping patterns. Thus, projects that "only just clear"
the minimum rate of return would be rare.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.07      A sensitivity analysis carried out on the three sample projects
reveals that the rate of return is most sensitive to a fall in benefits, and
less sensitive to a rise in costs or to lags in construction periods and
benefit build-up rates, and that only when benefits fall by as much as 50%
ites the rate of return drop below 12%:

1.   Costs up 50%                                          12.6
2.   Lag of 3 years in construction                        17.6
3.   Lag of 3 years in benefits                            13.0
4.   Benefits down 20%                                     14.7
5.   Benefits down 50%                                      9.6
Project Risk
7.08      Project Risk.  The risks associated with the project are that:
(a) the ID underestimates the costs of each MIP;
(b) the ID projects unrealistic cropping patterns in order to
"ispread water" to the maximum number of farmers;
(c) IDA has overestimated project benefits (as the benefit fac-
tors have been given by IDA, there is no risk that GOMP
overestimates project benefits); and
(d) the use of zonal cropping patterns in the value of water
calculation results in a further overestimate of project
benefits, if the actual cropping pattern differs signi-
ficantly from the projected zonal average.
The following procedures have been designed to reduce each of these risks.
7.09      The first measure taken to reduce the project risk is that through-
out the life of the project, IDA will monitor the actual costs of MIPs, com-
pared with the proposed costs at the time of MIP appraisal, and will intervene
in the appraisal of further MIPs if the divergence is too high (Annex 1, para
29). Second, any significant divergence between the zonal and project-specific
cropping pattern will be closely monitored by IDA during the review of the
first five MIPs, and subsequently during regular supervision of the project;
IDA may, if necessary, change the assumptions on projected cropping patterns.
Third, the assumptions underlying the estimate of benefits are conservative,
and IDA will monitor the results of farmer and yield response to irrigation in
similar agro-ecological zones in India to determine whether, even though the
assumptions appear conservative today, some downward adjustment may be neces-
sary to the benefits, and thus to the maximum permissible costs. Adjustments
to the benefits, if any, will be made in April of each year, simultaneously
with the inflation-adjustment to benefits (Annex 1, para 31). Fourth, any
differences between project-specific and zonal values of water will be ave-
raged out over the State. Thus, not only are the risks spread geographically,
but also reduced through time, as two correcting mechanisms (on cost and
benefit estimates) have been incorporated into the appraisal process. The
risks associated with the project are thus, acceptable.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      An agreement has been reached with GOI and GOMP that MIPs financed
under the IDA credit would be designed, constructed and completed in accor-
dance with established requirements and criteria (para 5.04).
8.02      An agreement has been reached with GOI that it would make the pro-
ceeds of the credit available to GOMP on OI's standard terms and arrangements
for development assistance to the States (para 5.24).
8.03      Agreements have been reached with GOMP that:
(a)  It would constitute a panel of experts with qualifications
and terms of reference acceptable to IDA to review the plans
and design of the dams and their associated structures and
their adequacy (para 5.07);
(b)  It would make arrangements acceptable to IDA to inspect
periodically the dams and the related structures after con-
struction period (para 5.09);
(c)  It would employ engineering consultants with terms of
reference and qualifications acceptable to IDA for the
planning and design of the distribution systems of MIPs
(para 5.19);
(d)  It would promptly provide the funds to implement and com-
plete IDA-financed MIP works in accordance with the sche-
dle of expenditures (para 5.24);
(e)  It would, after the credit has been disbursed, complete the
MIPs as soon as technically and financially feasible (para
5.24);
(f)  It would maintain separate accounts on MIP expenditures;
(para 5.28);
(g)  It would ensure that these accounts would be audited annually
by the AG and that the resulting interim statement of account
would be submitted to IDA as soon as possible but not later
than nine months after the end of each fiscal year (para
5.28);
(h)  It would make complete accounts and financial statements
available for inspection during IDA review missions (para
5.28);
(i)  It would ensure that sufficient auditing staff would be
made available for this purpose (para 5.28);



- 37 -
(j) It would take all measures as considered necessary to mini-
mize the risk of malaria and other water-related diseases in
areas covered by MIPs financed under the credit (para 5.29);
(k) The AD would provide necessary guidance to the farmers on
the lay-out of farm channels and other related on-farm works,
through its extension staff (para 6.13);
(1)  The AD would maintain staffing of its agricultural extension
services in each MIP area in accordance with standards which
have been agreed with IDA (para 6.13);
(m)  In order to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture, GOMP
would, where required, strengthen the credit, input
supply, storage and marketing facilities that serve
the MIP areas (para 6.13);
(n) It would provide adequate funds to operate and maintain all
project works in accordance with sound engineering standards
(para 6.17); and
(o) It would review the water and water-related charges in the
State, by December 31, 1983. After paying due regard to
IDA's comments, and as soon as possible it would implement a
system of charges that would ensure recovery of annual O&M
costs and, to the extent possible, costs of infrastructure
investments. In establishing the level of charges, due con-
sideration would be given to the incentives and payment
capacity of farmers (para 6.31).
8.04      With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable
for a credit of SDRs 112.6 M (US$140.0 M) on standard IDA terms. The Borrower
would be the Government of India.

1/ Some studies of farmers' behavior, show that a simple approach can be
adopted to take into account the farmers' risk aversion by estimating a
certainty equivalent value (CE) of the expected value (EV). The formula
used is
CE = EV - (s x n)
where s = the standard deviation
n = a factor that expresses the farmers' risk aversion
The studies indicate that the farmers' choice of cropping patterns and
production techniques can be predicted for values of "n" in the interval
1 to 2 and that "n" decreases when the farm size increases. For this
analysis, it is assumed that n = 1.3. The variation in historical gross
returns under rainfed conditions are roughly within 30% of the average
values. It has been assumed that under "with project" conditions, the
gross returns would vary within 25% of the average values.
2/ The reward for management and entrepreneurship is primarily a premium for
the special skills that farm management requires. Consequently, it has
been assumed that the "management fee" is equal to 10% of the net returns.

INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
Criteria for IDA-Financed Medium Irrigation Projects
General
1.        The lending operation involves an appraisal of GOMP's Medium Irri-
gation Program for the next five years, with the main focus on agreed planning,
design, implementation and economic criteria for individual MIPs, thereby
ensuring technical and economic viability of the operation.
2.        Based on a review of existing MIPs in Madhya Pradesh and of present
design standards, a number of specific criteria for the planning, design and
construction and operation of MIPs to be financed under the project have been
developed. The key to successful irrigation development is to provide a
reliable water supply at the farmgate with a minimum of transit losses between
the dam and the plant. If the farmer has faith in the irrigation supply, he
will be keen to develop his land and buy the inputs that are required for
successful cultivation of high yielding crops, and will take advantage of the
irrigation system that has been provided for his use.
3.        The principal criteria for approval are that each MIP would:
(a) irrigate a CCA of between 2,000 and 15,000 ha;
(b) be completed within a period not exceeding 5 years fol-
lowing the award of the initial construction contract;
(c) would yield an economic rate of return of at least 12%;
and
(d) would be planned, designed, constructed and operated to
standards that would permit a timely and equitable dis-
tribution of water (e.g., lining, smaller chak sizes,
more regulation, etc.).
The AC of CWC would appraise and approve MIPs costing less than Rs 100 M
(excluding price contingencies). Any project exceeding this limit would be
submitted to IDA for approval. IDA would participate in the field appraisal
of projects with CCA above 10,000 ha.
4.        The planning, design, construction and operational criteria are
summarized below:
(a) An agricultural development plan would be prepared, based on
a soil and land irrigability survey and an agro-economic
(benchmark) survey;



66
ANNEX 1
Page 2
(b) Estimates of water supply would be based on recorded data to
the extent possible. Additional instrumentation would be
installed wherever necessary to supplement available records;
(c) Fortnightly crop water requirements would be developed for
a 20-year period using recorded rainfall applicable to the
command area and mean ETO values computed from a nearby IMD
station. Monthly reservoir operation study for the 20-year
period would be used to develop operating rules and to compute
average quantities of water released for rabi irrigation
(necessary for the economic evaluation);
(d) The Irrigation Department (ID) would layout, design and con-
struct lined distribution system from the dam to 5-8 ha out-
lets (para 15(a)) and unlined field channels to individual
farm or 2 ha operating units; provision should be made for
structures to regulate, distribute and measure deliveries;
(e) A groundwater survey would be carried out to identify present
use and future potential for groundwater development; the
survey should also identify potential drainage problems;
(f) drainage plan would be prepared and implemented, and its
cost included in the project estimates;
(g) GOMP's Dam Review Panel would review the plans, design and
construction of the dams in accordance with the terms of
reference agreed with IDA;
(h) Water deliveries to farmers would be on a rotational basis;
(i) The irrigation and drainage system and roads would be con-
structed concurrently with the dam;
(j) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project performance would
be carried out in the project area by the project management
staff, and also by the ID Project Preparation and Monitoring
(PPM) Cell; and
(k) Oustees from the areas to be submerged would be provided with
land suitable for cultivation, and as far as possible irrigated
land. They should be compensated at replacement value for the
loss of household and community assets where these are not
already provided in the new location. Also those owning land,
but not living in the submergence area, would be similarly
compensated.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
A. Planning Criteria
General
5.        Planning of irrigation projects should be a continuous process into
which there is a systematic feedback of experience. To make this possible,
a continuous monitoring and evaluation program is required to provide informa-
tion to the planners from experience on the construction and operation of the
project under implementation and from other projects. For this purpose the
project preparation and monitoring cells in the ID and the AD would be suit-
ably strengthened.
6.        The soil survey and land irrigability classification should be con-
ducted following the standard procedures outlined in the 1970 Soil Survey
Manual, IARI, New Delhi. In addition to the standard laboratory analysis,
measurements should be made of field capacity, wilting point and infiltration
and soil permeability rates in the main soil series. The present pattern of
land use and distribution of principal crops should be shown on the map (paddy,
non-paddy kharif, rabi and perennials) together with existing irrigated areas.
Areas with severe limitations in irrigability or drainability should not be
considered for irrigation development without a positive program for correcting
deficiencies. In all cases, particular attention should be given to identifying
and mapping areas where drainage problems can be expected to develop so that
appropriate groundwater monitoring and drainage plans can be established.
7.        A socio-economic survey should be carried out by the Directorate of
Economics and Statistics for each MIP to provide the background for an agricul-
tural development plan and to provide a benchmark against which future improve-
ments in the economic welfare of the population resulting from the project can
be measured. The survey should cover the following aspects:
(a) Demographic and social characteristics (i.e., population,
average family size, labor force, etc.);
(b) Employment (farm, non-farm) and income;
(c) Land use, ownership and farm size distribution;
(d) Existing cropping pattern and yields (distinguish between
rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and sources of irrigation);
(e) Agricultural production and marketable surplus;
(f) Use of agricultural inputs under both rainfed and irrigated
conditions (i.e., fertilizer, labour, draft, power, etc.)
expressed in physical units;
(g) Prevailing wage rates by season and by major agricultural
operations;



68
ANNEX 1
Page 4
(h) Marketing channels and prices; and
(i) Agricultural supporting services (i.e., extension services,
research, storage and processing facilities, credit, transport,
etc.).
Agricultural Development Plan
8.        The AD's PPM Cell would prepare an agricultural development plan for
each MIP after consultation with local opinion and other concerned agencies.
The plan should cover the following aspects:
(a) Background information on climate, topography, soil and
distribution of land ownership, drawing attention to any
particular factors which may affect choice of crops, drain-
age requirements, the need for land development and the
rate at which irrigation will be taken up, and production
increased (e.g., prevalence of exceptionally large holdings);
(b) The present cropping pattern and yields together with exist-
ing irrigation, use of agricultural inputs and high yielding
varieties;
(c) Projected cropping patterns taking into account, where necessary,
the different soil types in the area. Irrigation intensities of
about 120-140% should be planned. A guideline for cropping pat-
terns has been prepared for each agro-ecological zone.
(d) As a necessary condition for the successful development of the
project, adequate provision should be made for the supply of
inputs and marketing of products. The AD PPM Cell would be
responsible for including in the project report an analysis of
the present credit arrangements in the command area (for this
purpose a survey should be conducted by ARDC and the Cooperative
Department) and the proposed arrangements for the future. Sur-
veys of other input requirements (seed, fertilizer, pesticides,
etc.) and the adequacy of marketing and processing facilities
should also be made and future requirements identified. In
addition, the adequacy of supporting services, including exten-
sion, demonstration farms and research facilities should be
examined, and proposals made for catering to the needs of the
project area.
9.        Water Supply.  The following hydrological data would be required for
each MIP:
(a) A stream gauging network should be established at suitable
locations at or below the dam site to develop basic hydro-
logical data for the planning, design and operation of the
project. Initial emphasis should be on obtaining frequent



69
ANNEX I
Page 5
gauge readings to establish a stage-discharge rating curve
for each location so that stream run-off can be recorded or
generated on a daily, monthly and annual basis. The gauge-
discharge relationship should be verified by current meter
measurements; however, until such time as measurements by
current meter become available, it may be necessary to rely
on the float method now commonly used;
(b) At least one year of assured stream gauging records for each
sub-project should be used. Stream gauging work should begin
immediately on all projects proposed for financing under the
credit, so that for.projects planned in the fourth year of
the credit, four years' records should be used. The measure-
ments obtained from properly installed and maintained stream
gauging stations would provide an immediate check on inflow
estimates obtained by other means and, in the long term, will
assist in reservoir operation and monitoring of project use.
It is necessary to stress the importance of establishing the
river gauges and then reading water levels as frequently as
necessary to record fluctuations during flood events. With
these observations recorded the conversion to volume of
water flowing past the site can be made later. The monsoon
or annual run-off estimates thus obtained for each year
should be distributed by months on the basis of actual
recorded flows at nearby stream gauging stations or existing
reservoirs. In the event that less than three years of
stream gauging records are available for the dam site under
review, AC will prepare a special hydrology annex to the
project summary.
(c)  Sediment estimates should be developed at each dam site
by a sediment sampling program. In the absence of actual
measurements, an estimate could be based on measured sedi-
ment deposition at existing reservoirs in surrounding areas.
It would be desirable to eszablish sediment ranges for new
reservoirs so the measurements of silt deposition can be
made in the future.
(d)  All available rainfall data should be collected in order
to improve the estimate of rainfall in each catchment.
Temporary gauges should be installed as soon as possible
within the catchment itself if there are no reliable
stations presently in operation within the catchment area
above the dam. It would be preferable that this gauge be
automatic recording gauges so that data can be used to
develop unit hydrographs and infiltration rates for design
flood computations.

ANNEX 1
Page 6
Water Demand 1/
10.       General planning criteria to be followed in determining water
requirements are:
(a) Crop water requirements should be calculated according to
FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24 2/ on the basis
of a design cropping pattern. A fortnightly irrigation
water requirement should be developed for the study period
using actual recorded rainfall in the project command area
(as measured at a centrally located station or as an average
of two or more representative stations);
(b) For planning purposes, efficiencies and requirements for
land preparation, etc., in a system fully lined from head
of canal to the lowest Government-controlled outlet, should
be in accordance with the values given in Table 1. The use
of the higher value of efficiencies would require full
justification.
(c) Early seeding of kharif crops, particularly cotton, should
be encouraged; to the extent possible, water should be
carried over for pre-monsoon irrigation;
(d) Project water supplies would normally not be sufficient
for irrigation of hot weather crops. Perennials, such as
sugarcane, bananas and fruit should not be supplied with
project water unless the fields served have established
wells for meeting the irrigation needs in the hot weather
season and scheduled closure periods; and
(e) A full kharif water supply including a provision for pre-
monsoon irrigation should be the first objective in the
reservoir operation study. The water supply for kharif
sown crops should be such that the cropping pattern be
satisfied in no less than three years out of four; however,
under-irrigation of up to 10% in any month could be tolera-
ted. The area to be cropped in the rabi season would be
determined by the storage available prior to the rabi plan-
ting season. For the economic evaluation, the average
quantities of water released for kharif and rabi irrigation
during the 20-year study period should be shown.
1/   Any inter-state implications of the siting of an MIP should be discussed
in the report. However, as the projects are so small compared with MP's
surface resources, the impact of any one project is not likely to be sig-
nificant.
2/   ETO as computed by modified Penman method have been computed for most
IND stations in MP.



71
ANNEX 1
Page 7
11.        Reservoir operating studies should be prepared for the selected
size of reservoir. Stream flow should be reconstructed on a monthly basis
for a minimum of 20-year period using established rainfall run-off correla-
tions and recorded run off patterns at nearby stream gauging or existing
reservoir projects. Evaporation should be based upon the reservoir surface
area each month and the corresponding evaporation rate for the month. The
water demand should be obtained in the manner described in previous para-
graphs, bearing in mind that the water available for rabi irrigation beginning
October 15 will be the water in storage at the end of September plus antici-
pated post-monsoon inflows less anticipated evaporation, less any amounts to
be used in maturing the kharif sown crops, and to carry over for pre-monsoon
irrigation, and any other priority use such as domestic water supply.
12.       The drainage plan should provide the necessary works to prevent water
logging and salinity problems from developing with irrigation for the grading
and shaping of natural drainage ways that are to be utilized as main project
drains and for the construction of additional intermediate drains necessary.
Project drains should be included in the cost estimates and implementation
schedules.
B. Design Criteria
Surveys
13.       Standard procedures should be adopted for reservoir and dam site
surveys. Strips surveys, superimposed on village maps, which are at an appro-
ximate scale of 1:4000, are required for the L-sections of the main and branch
canals and distributaries. A representative area or sample areas covering one
or more minors and accounting for about 10% of the command area (and in any
case not less than 500 ha) should be selected initially and surveyed to a scale
of not less than 1:4000 and with contour intervals not greater than 0.5 m. A
detailed layout of the distribution system down to the project outlets and to
the field levels will be made on this sample area to determine the plan,
designs and cost estimates to be applied to the entire project area. During
the first year of implementation the remainder of the command area will be
surveyed to the same scale and contour interval.
Drainage System
14.       Field and collector drains would be sized for rainfall intensities
of a 5-year return interval occurring simultaneously with irrigation in
progress, and with sufficient capacity to evacuate water from the fields
quickly enough to avoid crop damage. These drains would discharge into carrier
and effluent drains which have been identified as the main project drainage
system in the drainage plan.



72
ANNEX 1
Page 8
Irrigation System
15.       The following minimum design standards should be met:
(a) The ID would layout, design and construct facilities (i.e.,
main canals, branches, distributaries, minors, sub-minors and
water courses) down to regulated outlets serving 5 to 8 ha (as
an average) size blocks. The entire system from dam to the
5-8 ha blocks would be lined unless it can be demonstrated
that such lining is not economically justified.   (Implied in
this general criterion is the objective that no field should
be further away from a lined channel than 300 m.) In addition,
the ID would construct field channels down to each individual
holding. If the holdings are less than 2 ha, the water would
be supplied to outlets serving 2 ha operating units;
(b) The distribution system should be designed to deliver at least
1 cusec of water at the 8 ha outlet on a rotational basis (see
Appendix 1 for definition of the components of the distribution
system). Outlets from the main supply channels and turnouts
serving 5-8 ha blocks should be gated;
(c) Main and branch canals should be designed and constructed to
permit full irrigation deliveries at offtakes when flowing at
50% design capacity. Distributaries, minors, sub-minors and
watercourses should be provided with sufficient control
structures to make the required diversions throughout the full
operating range of the channel;
(d)  The head capacity of the supply channels should be designed to
deliver:
0.7 litres per second per hectare for non-rice projects
1.2 litres per second per hectare for rice projects
Up to 20% of the rice can be included predominantly non-rice
projects without increasing the main canal capacity above 0.7
litres/sec/ha, but if rice is to be concentrated in a defined
area as indicated in the land use map, channels serving this
area will have to be increased in capacity accordingly. Where
rice exceeds 20% in the command as a whole or in any part of
the command the head capacity of the supply channels should be
calculated with the formula:
q = 0.7 +    0.5x p
Where q = head capacity in 1/sec/ha of net CCA
p = proportion of the area under paddy in excess of 20%



73
ANNEX 1
Page 9
The above capacities assume a 24-hour operation, and planting
periods extending over one month. This should not preclude
consideration of day light irrigation only, by provision of
night storage at suitable sites along the canal or in small
systems within the reservoir,
(e) Escapes (wasteways) should be provided as needed at the end
of canals and at various points along the canal alignment.
Wherever possible, wasteway gates should be combined with
side channel overflow sections so as to provide both an
automatic control feature and capacity to empty the canal;
(f) Drain inlets or other design alternatives for cross drainage
structures should be provided whenever flood or erosion
risks establish that protection would be beneficial to culti-
vated lands below the main canal. A reduction in number and
magnitude of cross-drainage flows might reduce the structures
needed in minors and sub-minors, it might also facilitate
farming operations by the cultivators and permit an increase
in CCA by reclaiming land which would otherwise be lost to
drainage channels. Project Managers should record high water
marks on existing structures so that slope-area determinations
of flood occurrences could be used to check the validity of
empirical run-off formulae and, thus provide data for improv-
ing future designs.
(g) Small regulating ("balancing") reservoirs within the CCA along
the canal alignment or above the canal would increase project
water supplies for the irrigation scheme, add flexibility for
project operation and reduce main canal capacity needed during
peak periods;
(h) Measurement devices should be provided at the head of main
supply channels, at each off-taking channel, and at each
1 cusec outlet;
(i) An all weather access road should be provided to the dam site.
Main canals would be provided with a murrum service road on
the top of the bank; a 10' wide murrum road would be provided
along distributaries at the toe of the bank; all minors and
sub-minors would be provided with an all weather service path
on the bank; and
(j) A telephone and radio communication system would be provided
between the dam and the divisional headquarters and through-
out the command area at key canal locations.
16.       Masonry dams are checked for stability under various loading condi-
tions, as outlined in Indian Standards (I.S.) 6512-1972 "Criteria for Design
of Solid Gravity Dams." The design of earth dams is generally based on I.S.

meet basic requirements for: (a) safety against overtopping; (b) stability;
(c) safety against internal erosion; and (iv) safety against surface erosion.
17.       A study for the distribution of sediment deposit in the live storage
and dead storage would be carried out by standard methods. The head regulator
sill level fixed after this study provides the requisite silt pocket in the
dead storage for a period of 50 years.
18.       Sufficient freeboard should be provided for preventing overtopping
by waves with reservoir water surface level at top of the full reservoir level--
FRL. The wave height should normally be computed with a 50-year return interval
wind velocity (and by using the T. Saville method).
19.       As far as possible, preliminary dam layouts, designs and cost
estimates should be produced for alternative dam sites, designs and alignment
before finally deciding on the one proposed for construction.
20.       Dicken's formula or the Synthetic Unit Hydrograph method would be
used in the design of the spillway. The co-efficient selected should give a
design flood value at least equivalent to or greater than a 100-year return
interval. This will be followed by a check routing using a probable maximum
flood (PMF) derived preferably from probable maximum precipitation values
suggested by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) or if time does not allow,
by using a co-efficient of 4,000 in the Dicken's formula. This latter co-
efficient is indicated by enveloping points 3, 4, 5A, 12, 13, 17 and 20 in Map
23 of the GOMP Hydrological atlas. In the routing of the PMF as a check
flood, the concern should be primarily to ensure that the earth dam sections
will not be overtopped, that the spillway gates, if any, are properly designed
and operable and that the dam is not vulnerable to failure from any other
reason. (Because of the extreme length of the return interval assignable to
the PMF, and the short duration of a maximum water surface during the PMF
flood routing, wave action should, if it occurs, not be expected to constitute
a failure risk.) An auxillary spillway (overflow section) used in conjunction
with the main service spillway wherever topographical and geological condi-
tions are favorable is an ideal means of reducing spillway costs and decreas-
ing the free board requirements on the dam section. 1/ Fuse plugs and parapet
walls are other acceptable low-cost alternatives. However, the probable
causes for failure and the appropriate correcting measures to be taken are
peculiar to each individual site and therefore can best be considered by the
Dam Review Panel convened to advise GOMP on safety, economy in design and
improvement to be made in investigation and construction procedures.
1/   During the initial site reconnaissance of all dam sites, the location of
possible sites for auxillary spillways should be undertaken and the essen-
tial preliminary topographical and geological data collected.

C. Implementation Criteria
21.       Construction Practices.  The construction of MIPs should follow sound
engineering practices, and adequate quality control should follow laid-down
standards. To ensure that:
(a) Methods of field testing are accurate;
(b) Frequency of testing is adequate; and
Staff from the Directorate of Research of ID shall conduct random checks.
In addition:
(a) Embankments of canals, distributaries and earthfill around
structures should be compacted; and
(b) To ensure proper settlement of earthwork in minor channels,
the sections should be thoroughly saturated by ponding or
exposing to one season of monsoon rains before lining ope-
rations are undertaken.
22.       Construction Scheduling.  Construction should be scheduled for
completion within five years or less. The irrigation, drainage system and
road networks would be constructed concurrently with the dam, so that irri-
gation water can be released to the entire command areas in the same season.
23.       A commissioning period of at least one year would be introduced,
to facilitate an efficient transition from the construction phase to the
operational phase. During this period required adjustments in the system
would be done, and a budgetary provision would be made for this purpose.
D. Operational Criteria
24.       The projects would be operated in accordance with the following
criteria:
(a) Water deliveries to the farmers would initially be on a strict
rotational basis in accordance with predetermined schedules
established for the rabi and hot weather seasons. GOMP would
examine how rotational deliveries can be introduced during the
kharif season when rainfall is subject to significant variations;
(b) Before the start of each irrigation season, each farmer would
be notified of his allocation for water for the forthcoming
season and when the supply would be made available to him.
The allocation would be based on: (i) the seasonal availabil-
ity of water; (ii) cropping pattern and the calculated water



76
ANNEX 1
Page 12
demand for this pattern for the minor/distributary under
which he is located; (iii) the size of his holding; and
(iv) soil conditions;
(c) The canal would be closed for maintenance for an appropriate
period which would be determined with reference to the
cropping pattern and publicized well in advance;
(d) Adequate financial provisions would be made for efficient
operation, maintenance and management of each sub-project;
these provisions would be subject to continuous review; and
(e) GOMP would ensure that adequate supply provision has been
made for the supply of inputs (credit, seed, fertilizer, etc.)
for marketing and processing of products and for the provi-
sion of supporting services).
E. Maintenance and Management of the System
25.       Each MIP would be managed by one full-time project manager.   The
Irrigation Department would retain responsibility for the physical mainte-
nance of the irrigation system, from the dam down to the 5-8 ha outlet.
26.       After the completion of the construction and during the initial
period of project development, the project manager would be of at least
assistant engineer grade with a minimum of 3 months training in water manage-
ment provided by the Irrigation Department. Subordinate staff would also
receive training in water management. The Project Manager would be respons-
ible for ensuring timely, reliable and equitable deliveries of water to the
5-8 ha outlets. In assessing the scheduling of water deliveries he would be
assisted by the AD's extension (T&V) staff including subject matter specialist
(SMS) in water management. The AD officers would also coordinate with the
Project Manager to ensure the timely provision of inputs and credit, and would
advise farmers on water management. The existing District Water Utilization
Committee (WUC) chaired by the Collector would act as a review body.
27.       After the project has been fully developed, a new Project Manager
could be appointed from either the ID or the AD; in either case he will have
received suitable training in water management.
28.       From the time of first water deliveries, the Project Manager, in
cooperation with his AD or ID equivalent would submit a seasonal report--which
would focus on the agricultural production aspects of project performance--to
the WUC and to the PPM Cells of the ID and AD. CWC would use this report as
part of its progress performance review submitted to IDA.



77
ANNEX 1
Page 13
F. Cost Estimates
29,       Cost estimates for the project should be based on bid prices prevail-
ing in the region in which the project is located, at the time of submission
of the project to CWC. The estimate of project cost should include the cost
of land acquisition and resettlement of farmers displaced due to the project.
To account for variations in estimated quantities and any change in design of
the project, a physical contingency factor of 15% of the construction cost
should be included in the project estimate. Where work has reached the tender-
ing on construction phase a lower contingency of 10% would be used. Establish-
ment charges at the rate of 15% of the cost, including physical contingencies
but excluding the cost of land and equipment, should be provided in the
estimates. In April of each year (1982-85), IDA will compare the appraisal
estimates with the actual cost of construction, and, if necessary, will adjust
the cost estimates of further MIPs being submitted for CWC's appraisal, even
if they fall within CWC's "free limit" for appraisal.
G. Economic Criteria (see Annex 6)
30.       Each of the projects approved should yield an economic rate of return
of at least 12%. 1/   Indicative project benefits are based on the expected
value of water in each agro-ecological zone, and adjusted to include the
effects of discounting, and of different construction periods and benefit
build-up rates. For this analysis, project costs should include the cost of
on-farm development. From these calculations, maximum permissible costs (in
financial terms) per m3 of water released for irrigation have been developed
for each zone, and for different construction periods. The CWC would use
these as a guide in evaluating the economic viability of each sub-project.
31.       AC should consult IDA in April of each year (1982-85) to ascertain
what escalation factor should be applied to the benefit factors used in the
economic analysis, to take account of inflation in the period after 1981/82.
At this time, IDA may also make two other adjustments to the benefit factors.
First, any significant divergence between the zonal and project-specific
cropping pattern will be closely monitored by IDA during the review of the
first five MIPs, and subsequently during regular supervision of the project;
IDA may, if necessary, change the assumptions on projected cropping patterns.
Second, the assumptions underlying the estimate of benefits are conservative,
and IDA will monitor the results of farmer and yield response to irrigation
in similar agro-ecological zones in India to determine whether, even though
the assumptions appear conservative today, some downward adjustment may be
necessary to the benefits, and thus to the maximum permissible costs. Adjust-
ments to the benefits, if any, will be made in April of each year, simul-
taneously with the inflation-adjustment to benefits.
1/   The estimated opportunity cost of capital in India.

Definition of Channel
(a) Main Canal (including its identified branches)
The principal channel of a canal system off-taking from a river
or reservoir is called the main canal.
(b) Distributary. Channel taking off from a main canal or branch
canal with head discharge of more than 40 cusecs is called a
distributary.
(c) Minor. Channel taking off from the main canal or distributary
with head discharge of less than 40 cusecs is called a minor.
(d) Sub-Minor. Channel taking off from a minor is called a sub-minor.
(e) Watercourses. Watercourses is a channel taking off from a branch
canal, distributary, a minor or sub-minor which conveys water to
the Government outlet serving 5 to 8 ha sub-chaks.
(f) Field Channel. Field channel is a channel taking off from the
Government outlet and connecting the farm gate.
(g) Farm Channel. Farm channel is a channel to carry water from the
farm gate to the field.
Component of Drainage System
The drainage system is divided into the following categories:
(a) Field Drains. These are the farm drains at the end of graded
contour strips or at the end of property bunds running perpen-
dicular to the strips and parallel to the field irrigation chan-
nels. These would draw the surplus irrigation water during the
irrigation season and would also help in the quick disposal of
storm water for the fields in the monsoon period.
(b) Collector Drains. Theses drains collect the water from the field
drains and are intermediary drains between the field drains and
the carrier drains. These drains would ensure quick disposal of
the water received from the field drains.



80
ANNEX 1
Appendix 1
Page 2
(c) Carrier Drains. These are located in the natural depressions or
valleys. The collecting drains lead water into these drains.
Based on the topography, field drains may in some cases, directly
lead the water into these drains without the intermediary collec-
ting drains.
(d) Effluent Drains. They are the natural main drains already in
existence. The carrier drains will lead water into these drains.
These are the final natural nallas which carry the discharge to
the main drainage (river) of the area.

MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
Performance Review of Existing Medium Irrigation Projects
1.        Based on a series of field visits and data collected by the Irriga-
tion Department in response to questionnaires, a review has been made of
selected existing medium irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh. This review
encompasses the agricultural, irrigation, hydrological and economic perfor-
mance of these projects. The data on which this analysis was based is, how-
ever, somewhat incomplete, particularly with regard to yields and increases
in production achieved: as it was necessary to supplement the data-with a
large number of assumptions, the results of the review (particularly the
economic analysis) should be considered as no more than indicative.
Agricultural Performance
2.        The MIPs studied by the mission can be classified broadly into
three groups:
(a) Rice Projects in the eastern part of MP;
(b) Projects in kharif non-rice rainfed cropping areas; and
(c) Projects in rainfed rabi cropping areas.
There are marked differences in performance between these groups.
The Rice Projects
3.        Uptake of irrigation by farmers was rapid since for the most part
land was already bunded and water had merely to be channeled into the paddy
fields adjoining the outlets from which it could spread by field-to-field
irrigation. Areas not previously bunded were quickly converted to paddy
fields. The area irrigated has generally corresponded with that projected
in the design but tailend farmers suffer considerable delay in receiving
water and often only get a single irrigation. Since these projects were
mainly designed to provide a supplementary or crop saving irrigation there
has been little change in practices as compared with those under rainfed
conditions. Average yields of paddy have increased to 1.5-1.8 t/ha, compared
with average rainfed yield of 0.8-1.0 t/ha. This may be compared with pro-
jected yields of 2.5-3.0 t/ha in the project reports. In favorable years,
limited areas have also been provided with irrigation for rabi crops.



82
ANNEX 2
Page 2
Projects in Kharif Non-Rice Cropping Zones
4.        The projects are in the southern and western parts of IP with
rainfall from 800 to 1,200 mm. Before irrigation, the main crops grown
were sorghum, cotton, groundnuts and pulses.
5.        The proposed irrigation in some of the MIPs provided for supple-
mentary irrigation of a considerable area of kharif crops varying from 65%
to 80% of the proposed irrigation. In most projects, emphasis was placed
on irrigation for rabi crops. Uptake of irrigation by farmers has, in
general, been satisfactory especially in the lower rainfall areas and where
farms were of small to medium size. In practice, irrigation of kharif crops
has been small except where hybrid cotton is grown which is irrigated in
the post monsoon season. Appreciable areas of perennial crops (sugarcane
and bananas) have been irrigated where canal irrigation can be supplemented
by groundwater. In general, irrigation has been used to grow a second crop
in the rabi season, especially Mexican wheat so that double cropping is
practiced on a substantial proportion of the cropped area. Since Mexican
wheat has a higher water requirement than that projected for kharif crops
or local tall wheat varieties, the areas irrigated have been substantially
smaller than those projected. Irrigation techniques of farmers range from fair
to good.
Projects in Rainfed Rabi Cropping Areas
6.        The projects are in the central and northern parts of MP with
a rainfall of 800 to 1,000 mm. The main crops are local tall wheat, gram,
lentils and linseed. The projects were designed to provide irrigation
mainly for rabi crops, especially local and Mexican wheats; provision for
irrigation of paddy was made in some cases though these are not paddy growing
areas.
7.        Uptake of irrigation by farmers has been slow and even after 20
years the targeted irrigated area in Mula project was not reached nor was the
full irrigation supply utilized.
8.        Irrigation techniques by farmers are rudimentary with wild flooding
of the fields. Double cropping has not been attempted and the bulk of the
supply has been used to give a supplementary irrigation to local tall wheats
and gram. The very large size of farm holdings in this area is undoubtedly a
major reason for poor uptake and practices. Targeted yields were four tons
per ha for Mexican wheats and 2 tons per ha for irrigated local wheat as
against achieved averages of 1.5 t/ha and 1.0 t/ha, respectively.

Irrigaition Performance, Design Standards and Management
Analysis of Performance
9.        To obtain a detailed picture of factors affecting the irrigation
performance of MIPs, 10 projects were visited and an analysis of five
representative projects has been undertaken. The analysis has been based
on original project documents and records taken in three successive years
1975/76 to 1977/78.
10.       Saroda is a rice project in eastern MP designed to provide supple-
mentary irrigation to the rice crop. The actual area irrigated has been only
75% of that originally designed and 54% of the net CCA (Table 1). With an
assumed efficiency of 48% (distribution system 64%, below the outlet 75%),
actual releases on an annual basis have just met theoretical calculated
requirements although monthly adjustment of releases to requirements has
often been poor. Enquiries in the field showed that while farmers in the
head reaches obtained ample supplies, those at the tail received only a single
irrigation.
11.       Sampna is in a kharif cropping area and the project was designed
to provide irrigation for rabi and some garden crops. The area actually irri-
gated is only 65% of that anticipated and 39% of the net CCA while water
released has been 99% of the total live storage capacity. With assumed overall
project efficiencies of 45% and 35%, respectively, actual releases were only
57% and 35% of the calculated requirement for the actual cropped area showing
a serious shortage of the available water in storage and severe underirrigation
of the crops. Canal density down to the government outlet is only 7 m per ha
and canal capacity is only adequate for 78% of the actual irrigated area if
operated 24 hours out of 24.
12.       Satak project in a kharif cropping zone was designed for irrigation
of cotton, wheat during rabi, and perennial crops. The actual area irrigated
is 64% of that planned and actual water releases match calculated requirements
if overall efficiency of 45% is assumed. However, data for selected outlets
showed that 80% of released water is received by the head and middle reaches,
but only 20% by the tail reaches.
13.       Chillar project also in a kharif cropping zone was designed to
irrigate rabi crops, especially Mexican wheat, and 24% of kharif crops includ-
ing rice. The present area of kharif crops is 73% of that proposed. Actual
water releases on average meet 96% and 73% of calculated requirements assuming
45% and 35% overall efficiencies, respectively. More specifically, actual
releases in 1966/77 were higher than requirements, while in 1977/78 a year in
which the tank only half filled releases, met only 69% of calculated require-
ments. Canal density of the distribution system is 10 m per ha.
14.       Khetan is in a rabi cropping zone and was designed to irrigate the
wheat crop (80% tall local, 20% Mexican). The fact that the area irrigated was
only 32% of that proposed is a reflection of a lack of interest by the farmers
in this area.



84
ANNEX 2
Page 4
15.       Shortfalls in the performance of the projects studied are mainly
due to an underestimation of:
(a) crop water requirements;
(b) water conveyance losses;
(c) losses below the government outlet;
(d) canal distribution capacities; and
(e) required storage capacity.
Planning and Design of Canal Systems
16.       The distribution systems have been designed without taking sufficient
account of basic planning standards. Studies of present and future cropping
patterns, crop water requirements, extent of irrigable command area, desired
irrigation cropping intensity, level of canal seepage, conveyance and field
efficiency, proposed system of canal operation and possibility of supplement-
ing water supply from groundwater, have been dealt with insufficiently during
the preparation of the project documents. Topography and type of soil have
not been taken into consideration.
17.       In all the project areas visited, shortage of water to irrigate
the designed command area is a common problem. This is due mainly to the
optimistic planning assumptions of crop water requirements and water losses
which have both resulted in an over-estimation of the irrigation potential.
This, together with low planned irrigation intensities, has resulted in canal
systems being laid out and constructed over a much larger area than can effec-
tively be served. As a result, distribution of water to farmers has been both
inequitable and unreliable.
18.       Deficiencies commonly encountered with existing headwork structures
and canal distribution systems include:
-    Excessive seepage loss.  This may be due to inadequate
compaction of embankment during original construction and
poor maintenance.
-    Deterioration and loss of capacity by siltation, erosion,
weed growth, and general lack of maintenance.
-    Insufficient control structures, particularly cross-regulators,
to permit full command at reduced flows.
-    No provision for regulation or measurement of flows at off-
takes from distributors or minor canals.
-    Improper alignment of the channels and incorrect position of
outlets.

ANNEX 2
Page 5
Supply to an excessively large area from a single outlet
(40 ha). Field channels built by farmers cannot effec-
tively convey water for a distance more than 300-400 m.
Inadequate density of delivery systems ranging from 4 m/ha
in Khetan to 19 m/ha in Satak, compared with a norm of
30-40 m per ha.
Lack of organization of cultivators in command area.
Inadequate number of bridges and roads.
Inadequate road access for canal inspection, operation and
maintenance.
Project Operation and Maintenance
19.       Project operation and management are the responsibility of ID
engineering and technical staff. The ID is organized in circles headed by
a Superintending Engineer. Each circle covers six divisions, each headed
by an Executive Engineer who in turn is responsible for five to six subdivi-
sions headed by Assistant Engineers. Each subdivision may have from five
to six medium and minor irrigation projects, giving a total of around 150
projects in each circle. Since the ID staff are also responsible for plan-
ning and construction of new projects, operation and management of existing
projects receives little attention and, at best, is the responsibility of
Junior Engineers who lack training for the task.
20.       In the absence of adequate control structures, and adequate field
channels below the outlet and of any planned schedule of irrigation, water
distribution has been very inequitable with farmers on the upper reaches
and close to the government outlets receiving more than their share of the
available water. Most of the canal systems are operating at very low levels
of efficiency due to this lack of operational control.
21.       Unattended or overdue maintenance of canals and structures is one
of the major problems in the project areas. Current budgetary allocations for
operation and maintenance (Rs 25 per ha) are inadequate for the purpose.
Hydrological Review
General
22.       A review was undertaken of the hydrological data of the selected
existing medium projects and replies to the World Bank Questionnaire. (Refe-
rence was also made to the information given in the Hydrological Atlas 1/.)

of Madhya Pradesh, Volume I, 1973.

ANNEX 2
Page 6
Reservoir Inflow Estimation
23.       In the absence of actual gauging data, runoff from catchments of
the majority of existing medium projects are estimated from the empirical
relationship, derived by Alexander Binnie, which relates annual runoff to
annual rainfall. Strange's table which derives annual runoff from monsoon
rainfall was used for some existing projects. The table is subdivided into
"good", "average" and "bad" conditions. Strange's "good" corresponds fairly
closely with the Binnie values.
24.       As part of the review, results from seven reservoir operating tables,
supplied in response to the World Bank's questionnaire, were used to examine
the validity of the Binnie's table. In five out of 33 cases the runoff was
significantly less than that predicted from the Binnie relationship.
25.       The accuracy of the Binnie Table is no better than the accuracy of
the estimate of the rainfall within the actual catchment being considered.
Individual catchments occasionally produce a yield considerably less than might
be expected from the rainfall recorded in the vicinity. This is ascribed to
local rain shadow conditions wherever ridges lie across the path of the South-
west monsoon. Rain gauges are therefore needed within each individual catch-
ment if runoff is to be estimated with any accuracy.
26.       A significant number of years of record is also needed to estimate
probabilities with any degree of reliability. The Central Water Commission
recommends a period of 35 years for representing average conditions. It
should be acknowledged that estimates of inflow obtained from empirical formula
are unlikely to be accurate to within +10%. Much depends upon the distribution
of rainfall within the year and the intensity of major storms, apart from the
characteristics of individual catchments.
27.       Planning of projects for irrigation of kharif crops and the prepara-
tion of reservoir operating tables are dependent upon the use of monthly
inflows. This information cannot be obtained from Binnie's or Strange's
tables. In the absence of river gauging, the distribution of monthly inflows
during the year could be estimated by correlation with available gauging results
on adjacent streams or existing reservoirs.
Reservoir Evaporation
28.       Evaporation losses from medium projects form a significant proportion
of the available yields from the catchment areas and vary from 10% to 25% of
the live storage capacity of the respective reservoirs. This fact must be taken
into account when selecting the size of the area to be commanded.
Siltation
29.       Existing projects have been designed assuming an average silt load
of 0.75 acre ft per year per square mile of catchment area. It has then erron-
eously been assumed that the dead storage capacities of individual reservoirs



87
ANNEX 2
Page 7
would silt load at this rate for a selected period--usually 50 years for MIPs.
Average silt loads in excess of the assumed figure have been measured at some
actual gauge discharge and silt observation sites in the State. Additional
measurements should be of the rate of silt deposition in existing medium
projects with particular reference to the location within the reservoirs that
the silt is being deposited. Sediment accumulation throughout the reservoir
must be studied by the area reduction method to determine if the dead storage
levels are set properly.
Floodflow Estimation
30.       Existing medium projects under review estimate flood inflows by
the empirical formula of Dicken's Q = CM 3/4 with the value of 'C' taken as
1,400 (where Q is discharge in cusecs and M the area in square miles). only
in the case of the Chillar Project was a greater value of 'C' = 2,514 used,
as a flood equivalent to that magnitude was experienced in the basin prior
to construction. The Hydrological Atlas plots the values of 'C' for previous
floods in the State and indicates a higher average value for 'C' of 3,000
for catchment areas between 10 and 500 square miles.
31.       Although a 'C' value of 1,400 is in common use for all catchments,
the available flood history points to the need for a larger 'C' factor.
Reservoir Sizing
32.       Storage of water forms some 60%-70% of the cost of existing medium
projects. Live storage provided in existing projects under review varies from
64% to 100% of the assumed average yield from the catchments. Reservoirs are
commonly sized, under present procedures, on the basis of a 75% dependable
runoff year. It can be anticipated that additional storage in excess of that
normally provided could be obtained for a comparatively small increase in
total cost for some projects, while in others, this would not be the case.
In the preparation of new project reports, consideration should be given to
alternative reservoir sizes.
Economic Performance Review
33.        The data on which this analysis was based is incomplete, parti-
cularly with regard to the data on gross cropping intensity--i.e., how much
of the command area continues to support rainfed crops after the introduction
of irrigation. The data provided by the Irrigation Department relates almost
entirely to the irrigated areas only, but the question of how much of the area
continues to support rainfed crops is significant in determining the total
benefits derived from irrigation in that area. For example, in one project



88
ANNEX 2
Page 8
the farmers may continue to cultivate the same area of, say, kharif rainfed
crops as before irrigation, as well as double cropping the same areas in
rabi (which were previously fallow but can now be irrigated); whereas in
another project, the farmers may stop growing rainfed kharif crops and switch
their activities to the irrigated crops in one season only. This means that
in the second project, the primary benefits are from increased yields and
possibly a change in the cropping pattern towards more high value crops,
whereas in the first project there were additional benefits from the increase
in the cropped area. Thus, the results described below are necessarily based
on some assumptions about cropping intensities under the project which could
be subject to review. The costs and benefits have both been expressed in
1980/81 prices and the economic rates of return have been calculated for a
project life of 50 years.
34.        The main factors which influence the rate of return of a project
are the following:
(a) The construction period: because construction costs are
discounted through time, the longer it takes to build a
project, the higher the discounted costs are. The five
projects reviewed have all been spread over significantly
more than the ideal 5-year recommended construction period.
The two principal causes of delay appear to have been the
financial constraints imposed on the Irrigation Department
and the technical difficulties encountered during construction.
(b) The cost per ha of CCA and of actually irrigated area ranges
from Rs 3,950 to Rs 8,374 and from Rs 7,235 to Rs 17,337,
respectively (see Table 1). As 60%-70% of the cost of irri-
gation projects is in the dam, the selection of a site which
will minimize the cost of construction, therefore, has a
significant impact on the rate of return.
(c) The cropping intensity: As indicated above, this variable
is also important in determining the total benefits arising
from a project. The extent to which an area can be double
cropped depends partly on the sowing date of the kharif crops,
partly on the duration of the kharif crops and partly on the
suitability of the soils for rabi crops.
(d) The extent of the yield increases is another major factor in
determining the total benefits and this, in turn, depends on
the quantity and the timing of the water made available for
the crops.
35.       The following is a summary of the economic analysis of each project:
(a) Saroda: a rice project in eastern MP, this has been one
of the least successful of the medium irrigation projects
reviewed, showing a rate of return of 6.4%. It went through
a relatively long construction period and it was ten years



89
ANNEX 2
Page 9
before the first irrigation water was released. Since
the project has been operating, the distribution of water
through the command area has been fairly poor, with most
of the water going to the sandy soils and the head reaches
and very little reaching the heavy soils and the tail end.
Consequently, yields have been relatively low. There has
not been much increase in the cropping intensity or change
in the cropping pattern; most of the benefits have been
based on the increase in paddy yields due to irrigation.
Surprisingly, it has the lowest ratio of cost per ha of
actual irrigation compared with the cost per ha of CCA.
(b) Sampna: a project in the kharif/rabi cropping zone, has a
rate of return of 8.2% which is very close to the average
for the five projects. However, it has one of the highest
ratios between the cost per ha of actual irrigation and
the cost per ha of CCA. The former is nearly three times
the latter. Although the project was completed fairly
rapidly--the first year of irrigation was about six years
after the beginning of construction--the cost of construc-
tion was much higher than anticipated because the dam slipped
twice after irrigation had begun. The costs involved in
repairing the slips made a significant contribution to the
discounted cost of the project as they were incurred fairly
late in the project life. The benefits stem partly from an
increase in the cropping intensity and yields and partly
from an increase in the proportion of the area under higher
value crops--in this case, particularly wheat. There was
no one dominant factor among these which accounted for the
benefits. This project would have been fairly successful
if there had not been problems with the construction of the
dam.
(c) Satak. With a rate of return of 10.8%, this was the most
successful of the projects reviewed. Like Sampna, it is
also in the kharif rabi cropping zone. Although the major
construction works were not completed until about 12 years
after the beginning of construction, water was released
after seven years which permitted benefits to be accrued
from that time onwards. This is an important factor in
determining the rate of return. Although there was some
increase in the cropping intensity, the main benefits seem
to stem from the diversification of the cropping pattern
towards high value crops, such as wheat, chillies, vege-
tables, hybrid cotton, sugarcane and bananas, and the
increase in yields permitted by the provision of irrigation
water. This project is in one of the most profitable
agricultural areas of the State and the rate of return
would have been higher had it been in a less successful
area where the "without project" situation would have been



90
ANNEX 2
Page 10
relatively poor. As it is, the "without project" situation
in Satak would still involve some proportion of high value
crops and relatively high yields.
(d) Chillar. Another project in the kharif cropping zone, this
has also been relatively successful, with a rate of return
of 10%. Although the project developed slowly--the first
year of irrigation being ten years after the beginning of
construction--the benefits were significant, with an
increase in the cropping intensity combined with a shift
from kharif to rabi crops and a change in the proportion
of high value crops, particularly wheat (both Mexican and
local). Although there was some irrigated groundnut and
gram, the cropping pattern did not diversify nearly as
much as in the case of Satak. This project also showed a
relatively high ratio of the cost per actually irrigated
ha compared with the cost per ha of CCA, unlike Satak
which was one of the lowest.
(e) Mola. This project, in the rabi cropping zone, was selected
to substitute Kethan, for which data was insufficient for
the economic analysis. This was the least successful of the
projects reviewed, partly because of the slow development
(the first year of irrigation was eight years after the
beginning of construction) and partly because on the benefit
side there was little increase in the cropping intensity and
the yields. There was some shift from rainfed kharif jowar
to irrigated rabi wheat, but this was not as marked as expec-
ted or as possible. Under rainfed conditions, a large propor-
tion of the area was already under wheat, but this area could
have been increased, as could the area under HYV wheat.
Conclusion
36.       None of these projects show a 12% rate of return to equal the oppor-
tunity cost of capital in India, and they are thus disappointing in their
performance. Given the climatic conditions, it would be feasible to exceed
the 12% rate of return if two important conditions are met:
(a) The period of construction be reduced to five or six years,
with irrigation water delivered as soon as it is stored and
an irrigation block is completed; and
(b) The irrigation deliveries be timely and reliable: only with
this assurance would the farmers shift towards a more intensive
use of inputs, higher value crops and more double cropping.

MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agricultural Development under the Project
1.        The likely agricultural developments under the project are described
zone-by-zone; projected cropping patterns are given in Volume I, Table T-9,
and the zones are shown on Map IBRD 15151.
2.        The Rice Zone (Zone 1).  First priority will be given to the rice
crop. Under existing projects, irrigation is provided normally only at the
end of the growing season. With more emphasis being given at the beginning
of the monsoon to the timely preparation of the land for transplanting, it is
expected that farmers will be encouraged to transplant rice and to switch from
broadcast medium to late maturing, low yielding local varieties to high yield-
ing varieties maturing in 120 to 135 days on about 70% of the area. Due to
earlier maturity, less irrigation water will be required than is now needed
under existing projects to mature the crop after the end of the monsoon.
Yields of transplanted high yielding varieties are expected to average 3.5
tons per ha. On the remaining 30% of the area, it is expected that farmers
will continue to grow late maturing, improved broadcast varieties preferred
for home consumption, but these will also benefit by a more reliable and timely
provision of water for completion of the biasi operation (crossploughing and
puddling followed by weeding) with yields thus increasing from 1.1 t/ha under
rainfed conditions to 2.3 t/ha.
3.       Water will also be provided to irrigate some 30% of rabi crops, mainly
wheat and gram. Due to the short rabi growing season in this zone (Zone la),
yields of wheat are not expected to be very high (1.8 t/ha), but the supply
of water for a second crop is considered important for the provision of addi-
tional employment.
4.        Rice/Wheat Zone (Zone 2).  The area sown with rice is expected to
expand to 70% as compared with 30%-35% under rainfed conditions. The strategy
for improving the rice production will be as in Zone 1, with similar projected
yields. Kharif irrigation would also be provided, when required, for maize
and soyabean, with expected yields of 3.5 and 1.5 t/ha, respectively. During
rabi, Mexican wheat and gram would be the main crops; yields are expected to
reach 2.5-2.7 t/ha and 1.0 t/ha, respectively. Small areas of vegetables and
berseem for green fodder are also expected to be grown.
5.        Wheat Zone (Zone 3).  The provision of drainage and, when necessary,
of irrigation should make possible an increase in the kharif cropped area from
25% to 45%. Soyabean and high yielding jowar are the main crops, with projec-
ted yields of 1.5 and 3.0 t/ha, respectively. Present jowar hybrids are not
very well suited to this zone, but new high yielding varieties are being
developed, which should be suitable. Cropping intensity in rabi will increase



94
ANNEX 3
Page 2
from 70% to 95% with Mexican wheat partly replacing local wheat. Yields should
increase to 2.5-2.7 t/ha for Mexican wheat and 1.8 t/ha for improved hard
wheats compared with 0.8 t at present. Supplementary irrigation of gram
should increase yields by 0.5 t/ha to 1.0 t/ha. Small areas of oilseeds and
fodder would also be irrigated.
6.        Jowar/Wheat Zone (Zone 4).  Irrigation of kharif crops (maize, jowar,
groundnut and soyabean) would enable farmers to increase their investment in
inputs with confidence. Yields of 3.5, 3.0, 1.5 t/ha, respectively, are pro-
jected. During rabi, cropping intensity would increase from 30% to 65% with
emphasis on Mexican wheat, improved hard wheats and gram, with yields as in
Zone 3. Small areas of chillies, vegetables and fodder would also be grown.
7.        Cotton/Jowar Zone (Zone 5).  Being the lowest rainfall zone, pro-
vision would be made for a high proportion of irrigated kharif crops and
biseasonal crops from about 70% in Zones 5a and 5b to 80% in 5c which has
soils of poor moisture retaining capacity. Under irrigation, long staple
cotton would replace very low yielding medium staple varieties grown -under
rainfed conditions. A yield of 1.6 t/ha is projected with effective planlt
protection. High yielding jowar, already becoming popular in this zone, would
replace local varieties. Mexican wheat and gram would be the main rabi crops
with small areas under vegetables, fodder and perennials (sugarcane, bananas)
which would be irrigated from wells in the dry season. Due to the carry over
of cotton, chillies and perennials, almost 100% of land would be occupied in
the overlapping period. Yields would be similar to those in Zone 3.
8.        Wheat/Jowar Zone (Zone 6).  Kharif cropping intensity would increase
from 35% at present to around 70% (including about 20% of unirrigated crops)
with irrigation of HYV jowar, soyabean and maize. In rabi, local wheats would
largely be replaced by Mexican wheat, with gram occupying 20% of the cropped
area. Yields of gram in this zone are expected to reach 1.2 to 1.4 t/ha.
Yields of other crops would be as in Zone 3. Smaller areas are also expected
to be cropped with vegetables, berseem for fodder and sugarcane which has a
projected yield of 55 t/ha.
9.        Wheat/Bajra Zone (Zone 7).  This would have similar cropping patterns
and yields to Zone 6, except that in rabi 15% of the cropped area would be
sown with Indian mustard which is well suited to this zone, with a projected
yield of 1 t/ha.
Agricultural Research
10.       Many of the most popular modern varieties of rice now grown on 50%
of the rice area in the Chhatisgarh region were the result of the plant
breeding programs including Safri 17, a very popular variety, Anupama, Garima,
Kranti and Pragati. Present programs aim at producing early to medium matur-
ing (120-135 days) high yielding varieties. The university has also produced
a number of hard grained wheat varieties which are now rapidly replacing older
varieties under rainfed and semi-irrigated conditions. The early maturing
variety Shera is suited for growing after paddy as an irrigated crop.

11.       At Indore, the university is continuing work on cotton improvement
which was initiated in 1924. Khandwa-2, released in 1971 and recommended
for dry land conditions in the Nimar plain, covers 250,000 ha and has spread
to areas in neighboring states, especially Gujarat (100,000 ha). Two recently
released hybrids suited to irrigated conditions are higher yielding and more
tolerant to jassid and blackarm attacks than hybrid 4 and Varalasemi, respec-
tively, earlier developed in Gujarat and Karnataka. Also at Indore, research
on dryland farming has progressed well in association with the Indo/British
Dry Farming Project.

MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
Suggested Guidelines for Establishing
Water Management Areas
1.        Under the project, two experimental Water Management Areas (WMAs)
for improved water management activities in each of four representative exis-
ting MIPs will be identified and developed. Each WMA will include one minor
canal, serving approximately 200 ha. For each project, the two WMAs will
be located to represent average or typical conditions in the project. One of
those WMAs will be developed fully, including all structures, water measuring
devices in the minor and at every outlet, cross regulators in the minor at
every outlet, and full lining down to 8 ha blocks with earthen field channels
to the farmgate. The other typical WMA in each project area would be deve-
loped on a basic necessities basis, with essential structures, water measuring
devices in the minor and at each outlet, and selective lining (e.g., near
structures). All WMAs would be reasonably easily accessible.
2.        In all WMAs, Rotational Water Supply (RWS) among farmers on each
outlet would be established by modifying the existing demand-sanction system
to limit the amount of water delivery time for each farmer during each rotation
period (with the optimum period rotation to be determined by the ID). The
amount of time for each farmer may be determined on the basis of landholding
size in the CCA, irrigated landholding size, or number of farms (i.e., each
farmer receiving an equal share), or any variation of the above to be decided
on a project basis by the ID prior to calculating time allocations for each
farmer.
3.        The ID would make arrangements in the WMAs to waive penalties for
farmers who are able to irrigate more than their sanctioned amount of land
with their allocated water supply, permit irrigation of non-sanctioned crops
according to farmer decisions, and enable water trading (e.g., of rotational
turns in a season) among farmers on the same outlet. ID would further make
arrangements to organize farmers on each outlet and minor into Water User
Associations (WUAs) which would be registered with the ID. Initially, the
WUA would be responsible for proper allocation of water under RWS and feedback
of information on problems and performance to ID. Possibilities would be
explored to make WUA financially viable (e.g., through bulk water sales to
a WUA acting as a retailer of water to farmers), responsible for payment
for water and watercourse maintenance, and a component in decision making
for canal system management and water deliveries into the WMA.



101
ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        ID would arrange for full monitoring of progress of improvements
in WMAs (and a comparable typical area in each project developed to normal
project standards) establishment of WUAs, and the impact of these develop-
ments, starting with a benchmark survey to define existing conditions. The
benchmark survey should include for each outlet a detailed physical descrip-
tion, its discharge, agricultural performance and attitude of farmers. ID
would further undertake or contract a local social-organizational study in
each WMA to provide a local social profile which would be considered at the
stage of design for minor level improvements, and in the development of the
WUA and its bylaws.
5.        ID would make arrangements to provide adequate field staff for
each WMA for efficient and controlled water delivery, advising and organizing
farmers and undertaking the required studies and surveys. Costs of all ID
inputs into each WMA, including additional staff, would be fully monitored
and analyzed comparatively on a three month basis. ID would establish tech-
nical guidelines and draw up a step-by-step timetable for development of
each WMA. Responsibility for each WMA (in all respects) would lie directly
with the ID officer-in-charge of the relevant irrigation system. An WMA
Coordinating Committee would be established in the PPM Cell with members to
include managers of the four projects where WMAs are located and relevant
officers from other Departments including, as needed, Agriculture, Revenue,
Cooperation and Panchayati Raj. The WMA Coordinating Committe would meet
quarterly to provide overall planning, coordination and oversight for WMA
activities.

MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
Flow Monitoring
1.        Operation of any irrigation project requires a good accounting and
monitoring of the water available for use. Accordingly, streamflow gauging
stations are proposed at or slightly downstream of the site of the storage
outlet works for 25 medium irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh.
2.        The streamflow stations will include a recorder shelter and stilling
well placed on the stream bank or bridge to keep a continuous record of river
stage at each site. Periodic current-meter discharge measurements will be
made at each site and related to the existing stage (or gauge-height) of the
river. Curves of relation will be established (stage-discharge rating curves)
to cover the entire flow range-in-stage for the operating period. Accordingly,
the continuous record of stage can be transformed into values of mean daily
discharge, instantaneous discharge, etc. Datum control will be maintained on
the base gauges, recorder settings, auxiliary staff gauges and benchmarks to
assure continuity and quality of the recorded data.
3.        Provision for the measurement of extremely large flows by current
meter (velocity-area method) requires a bridge or cableway installation across
the river in the vicinity of the gauge site. It is assumed that all but about
40% (i.e., 10 stations) will have bridges available for the measurement of high
flow; whereas the 10 stations will require cableway installations. Cost esti-
mates for permanent installations and measuring equipment for the 25 overall
sites are made accordingly.
4.        Other hydrometric and/or supplemental equipment which relates to
the flow monitoring of the 25 medium irrigation projects is kept to a minimum.
These items are primarily for associated surveying, drafting and the rain
gauges in the catchment area. Major supplemental equipment for reservoir
surveys (i.e. motor boats, echo sounders, theodolites and telerometers),
laboratory analysis, seismic, soil moisture and ground water measurement,
which require additional personnel (operators) with specialized training,
should be maintained and operated from a centralized locacion (basin head-
quarters) and in conjunction with major project operation. This centraliza-
tion of costly equipment which receives only periodic use will tend to elimi-
nate misuse, overly large investment costs, and the need for a large number of
specially trained people. This approach would be in keeping with the recom-
mendations made by the Madhya Pradesh Irrigation Department in the August
1980 publication, "Hydrometeorology of Madhya Pradesh."
5.        Personnel requirements are in accordance with those outlined in
Hydrometeorology of Madhya Pradesh.

MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
A. Economic Analysis of Medium Irrigation Projects
General (See Table T-20 for a sample economic analysis of three typical MIPs)
1.        The medium irrigation projects (MIPs) would be appraised and
approved by the AC of CWC within a free limit of Rs 100 M. Any MIP which
shows a benefit-cost ratio equal to or greater than 1.0 would be acceptable
for financing under the credit.
2.        In order to standardize the assumptions made in calculating project
benefits, IDA has developed estimates of the incremental value of water (IVW)
for each of the 11 agro-climatic zones in the State. When adjusted for the
effects of discounting and different build-up rates, these give a maximum
permissible cost of water released for irrigation in each zone. When compared
with the actual cost of water released in a proposed project (also adjusted
for the effects of discounting and different construction periods), the
benefit-cost ratio, or economic viability of the project, is derived.
Benefits
3.        General.  The estimates of IVW are based on the value of incremental
production resulting from the application of a unit of water released from the
dam to a unit of land in the command area; this was calculated by taking a
weighted average (weighted by the "future with" zonal cropping pattern) of
the value of production per net cropped ha of all crops in the "future with"
project situation, and subtracting from it the weighted average value of
production of all crops per net cropped ha in the "without" project situation.
This net incremental value of production per ha of net CCA was then divided by
the weighted average water requirement (at the dam) per ha of net CCA for that
cropping pattern in that zone, and the IVW per m3 of irrigation water was thus
derived. This can be expressed as follows:

I =    WRiA x  PiA x CIA)                   WRiB  x  PiBx CIB)
where     IVW      =  incremental value of water
NVP     =  net value of production
'A' nA  -  crops in the "future with" situation
'B' nB  -  crops in the "future without" situation
A  nA =  weight of each crop in the "future with" cropping
pattern, expressed as a % of the gross CCA
PiB  nB =  weight of each crop in the "future without" cropping
pattern, expressed as a % of the cropped area.
WRiA    =  water requirement of each crop in the "future with"
situation
WRiB    =  water requirement of each crop in the "future
without" situation
CIA     =  cropping intensity "with" the project
CIB     =  cropping intensity "without" the project
4.        An increase (or decrease) in the quantity of water available for
irrigation can thus be translated directly into an increase (or decrease) in
the benefits associated with the project. 1/
5.        Cropping Patterns.  These differ widely between agro-climatic zones,
in both the "future with" and the "future without" situations. The indicative
zonal cropping patterns are shown in Table T-9
6.        Yields and Inputs:
(a) "Future with" Project Situation: under irrigated conditions,
the yields and inputs of most crops have been assumed to
vary little between zones. However, variations have been
introduced for wheat, gram and sugarcane.
(b) "Future without" Project Situation: under rainfed conditions,
the yields and inputs of most crops have been assumed to vary
significantly between zones.
1/   Although strictly speaking, an increase (or decrease) in the quantity of
water available would probably result in a change in the cropping pattern,
this is within the margin of error of the estimates of value of water,
and therefore, not necessary to introduce into the analysis.

Prices for Economic Analysis
7.        General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs
and inputs are derived from the IBRD projected 1990 world market prices ex-
pressed in 1981 currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, hand-
ling and processing. The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains,
on the other hand, are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor (FCF)
to the financial price. The financial prices of various crops are projected
on the basis of their historical price trends. Present and projected finan-
cial and economic prices are given in Tables T-16. The detailed assumptions
behind the estimates are described below.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
8.        Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially valued at a fixed
Pound Sterling rate. Since then, it has been fixed against a "basket" of cur-
rencies. As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/Rupee exchange rate
is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made at US$1
to Rs 8.40.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
9.        The benefits of the MIPs are evaluated at world market prices, i.e.,
they measure what India would have to pay for imports or receive for exports.
Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not traded on the world
market. Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a distortion in the price
relationship between traded goods--valued at world markets--and non-traded
goods--valued at local prices. Thus, the costs are not directly comparable
with the benefits. In order to make them comparable, an SCF is applied to
the price of non-traded goods and consumption. In the absence of trade
restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated using the formula:
SCF  =       X+M
X + S  + M + T
x        m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restric-
tions, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning
Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of
conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that implicitly
give a SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this estimate,
a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
Prices of Agricultural Outputs (Table T-16)
10.       The economic prices for traded goods such as rice, wheat, cotton,
groundnuts, and sugarcane are based on their border prices at the official
exchange rate (OER). The domestic cost components (i.e., local transport and
marketing charges) are adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for



112
ANNEX 6
Page 4
non-traded foodgrains (sorghum, maize and pulses are assumed to be non-traded)
are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor (FCF) to the financial
price. The FCF of 1.215 can be estimated with the following formula:
FCF =   (Q rice x PE rice) + (Q wheat x PE wheat)
(Q rice x PF rice) + (Q wheat x PF wheat)
where  Q: Madhya Pradesh Production
PE: Economic Price
PF: Financial Price
The projected financial prices for various crops are based on the estimated
historical price trends 1/ in Madhya Pradesh.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs (Table T-16)
11.       Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world market price.
Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded; to make allowance
for taxes and subsidies and the total cost of transport and marketing, a
conversion factor of 0.95 has been applied to their financial prices. The
economic price of seed and miscellaneous charges has been assumed to approxi-
mate the financial price: a conservative assumption has been made that
farmers may have to purchase seed at market prices. The financial price of
bullocks has been multiplied by the SCF to express it in economic terms.
Analyses of farm labor supply and demand in various Indian irrigation projects
typically give an economic shadow wage rate for farm labor in the range of 1/2
to 2/3 of the average financial wage rate. For the analysis of this project,
a shadow wage rate of 65% of the market wage has been assumed. The financial
wage and bullock rates have been assumed to vary between zones.
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
12.       The schemes would be constructed using a mixture of equipment,
skilled and unskilled labor. For the economic analysis, the CCF is estimated
as follows:
(a)  Traded Component . This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials. Since it is traded,
the conversion factor is 1.00. It is estimated that about
15% of the construction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-Traded Component.  This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 30% of the construction costs are included in
this category.

FAQ/World Bank Cooperative Program, Rome, April 1980.

ANNEX 6
Page 5
(c) Unskilled Labor. A minimum wage is in force in Madhya Pradesh.
Since daily workers virtually never are paid above the minimum
wage, it is likely that this wage is higher than the wage at
which the workers would be willing to work (i.e., their supply
price). Civil works construction is harder physical work than
farming, and experience from similar areas in India indicates
that the laborers require a premium of 25-30% to shift from
agriculture to construction work. By comparison with agricul-
tural wages in the State, it is estimated that the construction
laborers' supply price is about 15% to 20% below the minimum
wage. This gives a shadow wage factor which is 10% to 20%
below the SCF, or approximately equal to 0.65. It is estimated
that unskilled labor constitutes about 55% of the construction
costs.
Conversion Factor
Traded Items                                1.00
Non-Traded Items                            0.80
Unskilled Labor                             0.65
Construction Costs                          0.75
(weighted average)
13.       Discounting Factor.  A 12% interest has been chosen for the analysis,
as this rate approximately represents the opportunity cost of capital in India.
The final year of the construction period is chosen as the base year for dis-
counting purposes.
14.       Build-up Rates.  In order to take account of the time perspective
of yield and area development, building-up rates have been estimated separately
for rice and non-rice projects as follows:
Rice Projects                  Non-Rice Projects
Year      Yield Only       Yield x Area      Yield Only    Yield x Area
0           46                 23              60              30
1           55                 55              75              75
2            70                70              80              80
3           82                 82              90              90
4            90                90              96              96
5            96                96             100             100
6          100                100
Year 0 is taken as the last year of construction, when half the CCA is expected
to receive water.

Costs
15.       For the economic analysis, project costs should exclude the cost of
land acquisition, but include the cost of on-farm development; the economic
cost of production foregone on the land submerged by the reservoir and canals;
and the costs of O&M. The last two categories (land acquisition and O&M) are
assumed to be incurred annually over the life of the project. An adjustment
factor is provided so that their net present value can be calculated (Table
T-19).
16. (a) Construction Costs. The annual rate of implementation of MIPs has
been assumed as follows:
5 Years        4 Years        3 Years
Year    Percent of Construction Costs Incurred Each Year (%)
-4               6

The discounted end value of the construction costs (K ) can be
0
K      Pi x C x CCF                 (1)

i = year
Pi = percent of construction cost spent in year i

4-year construction period:        k    = 1.173
o4
3-year construction period:        ko3  = 1.111
(b)  O&M Costs.  These are taken at Rs 100 per ha of CCA, and are
assumed to be incurred from the last year of construction
through the life of the project. The discounted end value
of O&M costs (OMo) can be expressed as:
50          OM
OM  = om  x OM               (1+r)

(c)  Economic Cost of Land Acquisition.  The real cost to society
is the opportunity cost, that is, the production foregone by
the submersion of the land in the reservoirs and the loss of
lands acquired for the construction of the distribution system.
The per ha value of production in the future "without project"
situation is taken to represent this opportunity cost and is
added to the cost of the project. The discounted end value
of the costs of production foregone (LA ) can be expressed as:

LAo = la  x LA =              Lr)

They are expected to be incurred from the penultimate
year of construction through the life of the project.
(d)  Economic Cost of On-Farm Development (OFD).  These are assumed
to be incurred during the last year of construction. The dis-
counted end value of the cost of OFD can be expressed as:
OFD          OFD
0       (1 + r)
where i = 0.
17.       The discounted end value of all costs (construction, O&M and land
acquisition and OFD) (already adjusted by the CCF of 0.75) are then summed.
This adjusted cost is divided by the average quantity of irrigation water
released to give an annual economic cost of water--this figure is then com-
pared with the discounted end value of the benefits to give the B/C ratio.
18.       Benefits.  The discounted end value of the benefits can be
expressed as:
50     biz
B   -           _ _ _
where  B   =  discounted end value of the IVW

B.  Economic Justification of Canal Lining
General
19         The Project provides lining for all channels extending down to out-
lets serving 8 ha irrigation blocks instead of the traditional unlined chan-
nels serving 40 ha irrigation blocks. This Annex provides justification for
these improved design standards.
Basic Assumptions
20.       Conveyance Losses.  For a typical unlined irrigation system serving
about 10,000 ha, the wetted perimeter averages about 30 m2/ha. For a corres-
ponding lined system, the equivalent wetted perimeter is estimated at 25 m2/ha.
The seepage rates are assumed to be 8 cusecs per M ft2 in an unlined system 1/
and 3 cusecs per M ft2 in a lined system. Thus, the seepa e losses, when the
canal system is running full, are 0.731 m3/sec and 0.228 m /sec for unlined and
lined systems, respectively. When the releases are less than what corresponds
to the full capacity of the canal system, the wetted perimeter is reduced and
the seepage rate and losses are thus lower. However, when the canal deliveries
are rotated, the seepage losses are lower than if no rotation takes place. It
is estimated that the average seepage losses are about three-quarters of the
losses when the system is running full. For a ten-month irrigation season, the
total seepage losses would be about 14.2 Mm3 and 4.4 Mm3 for unlined and lined
systems, respectively.
21.       Operational Losses.  Operational losses occur when the releases from
the canal system are not properly controlled, that is when water deliveries are
made either at times when the farmer does not require water or in amounts that
are larger than what he requires to effectively irrigate his crops. In addition,
there are wastages at the time of canal closings, breaches, etc., which are
generally higher in an unlined system than in a lined system. Operational
losses are also much higher in the kharif than in the rabi because of the erra-
tic distribution of rainfall. For simplicity, it is assumed that the operational
losses are about 20% of the diversion in an unlined system and 15% in a lined
system.
22.      Field Irrigation Losses.  These are the losses within the 8 ha blocks.
They are the same for both unlined and lined systems and the assumptions are
as follows:
Field Ditch Losses (Unlined)    10%
Field Application Losses         20%
l/ The seepage rate in an unlined system has been consisteptly measured at
more than the normally assumed rate of 8 cusec per M ft (see Appendix 1).
To be conservative, the analysis has assumed 8 cusecs per M ft2.



117
ANNEX 6
Page 9
With the above assumptions and in a typical operational situation for MP
schemes, the water losses in an unlined system and in a corresponding
lined system serving 10,000 ha are estimated as follows:
Unlined    Lined
Mm3------  
1.  Total Water Releases                            70.0 a/    70.0 a/
2. Water Losses (from dam to 8 ha outlets):
Conveyance Losses                             14.2        4.4
Operational Losses                            14.0       10.5
Sub-total                                     28.2       14.9
3. Field Irrigation Losses:
Field Channel Losses                           4.2        5.5 b/
Farm Application Losses                        7.5        8.4
Sub-total                                     11.7       13.9
Total Water Losses as % of Total
Water Releases                                57.0       41.0
a/ From the dams.
b/ These losses are greater in lined systems than in unlined systems
because more water reaches the 8 ha outlets.
23.       Value of Water.  The returns to water at the dam has been calculated
for various zones (see Table T-19), ranging from Rs 0.4045 to Rs 0.5474 per m3
of water. For the purpose of this analysis, a value of Rs 0.44 per m3 at the dam
dam or Rs 0.75 at plants is assumed 1/. Since the water saved from lining
will be used to increase irrigation intensity, the marginal returns to water
saved is equal to the average return to water.
24.       Cost.  The total financial cost (including physical contingencies
and establishment costs) of an unlined system is estimated at Rs 9,000 per
ha and of an equivalent lined system, Rs 12,000 per ha. In economic terms,
the costs are about Rs 6,750 and Rs 9,000 per ha for an unlined system and
lined system, respectively.
1/ This assumes, on average, the overall efficiency of about 59% (para. 22).

25.       Build-up Rates.  The following patterns are assumed for costs and
benefits:
Year                        1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11-50

Benefits (% of Ultimate)                    35  60  75  85  92  97    100
26.       Recharge of Groundwater.  It is commonly assumed that most of the
water losses in an irrigation project recharge the groundwater and that some
portion is recoverable and can be withdrawn from wells. However, the evi-
dence available at present, indicates that only about 50% of the losses can
be utilized through groundwater pumping. The rest is lost through evapora-
tion or regenerates elsewhere where it may not be useable. Lining would
reduce seepage and operational losses from channels and thus reduce recharge
to groundwater. However, water saved by lining canals down to 8 ha outlets
would increase the amount of water used at the field and thus increase the
recharge at the field location. The net effect of lining on groundwater at
field level can be taken as follows:
Unlined System            Lined System
Water  Groundwater       Water  Groundwater
Losses  Recharge         Losses  Recharge
Utilized                 Utilized

Field Channels                       11.7       5.9            13.9      7.0
Total                              39.9      20.0            28.8     14.5
Reduction of groundwater recharge due to lining:  20.0 Mm3 - 14.5 Mm3 = 5.5 Mm3
Economic Evaluation of Lining
27.       In areas with surplus or saline groundwater, additional recharge to
groundwater has no value. In this case, the economic evaluation of lining does
not take into account the net effect of lining on groundwater. The incremental
benefits due to lining are estimated at Rs 8.32 M at full development. The
incremental cost due to lining of an unlined system is about Rs 3,000 per ha.
Using the assumed build-up rates for costs and benefits stated in para. 25 the
economic rate of return of lining is about 20%.
28.       In areas with limited groundwater and where farmers would utilize it
when available, a reduction of groundwater caused by lining will result in a
decrease in potential agricultural production from groundwater. Conservatively,
the value of groundwater irrigation is assumed to be the same as the value of
surface irrigation. The cost of pumping groundwater in India ranges between



119
ANNEX 6
Page 11
Rs 0.15/m3 for deep tubewells and Rs 0.30/M 3 for cd'allow tubewells.  A
value of Rs 0.25/mr is assumed for the analysis. The benefits from lining
in the limited groundwater situation is the difference between the value
of water savings and the value of the production foregone from a reduction
in groundwater recharge minus the pumping cost. The economic rate of return
in this case is estimated a. 15%.

DAM REVIEW PANEL - TERMS OF REFERENCE
General
The Panel will undertake periodic and comprehensive reviews of the
plans, designs and construction of the dams and related structures included
in each MIP, with the objective of ascertaining and reporting on their general
safety and performance, including consideration of geological, hydraulic and
structural aspects as well as soil mechanics.
Specific Actions
(i) To review all drilling and boring data and samples to
indicate any additional investigations and/or improve-
ments that may be required in connection with foundation
treatment, design parameters, borrow areas and potential
reservoir leakage;
(ii)  To review design parameters being used for the selected
construction materials;
(iii) To examine the design of filters and review their location;
(iv)  To review proposed construction plans, procedures and
schedules;
(v) To examine the adequacy of treatment given or proposed for
the foundations and abutments;
(vi)  To advise on instrumentation to be installed in embankment/
non-overflow spillway sections and to ensure that a program
of monitoring is provided for;
(vii) To review the hydrological data and computations used in
sizing the reservoir;
(viii)  To review the flood hydrology used in sizing and designing
the spillway;
(ix)  To examine the structural integrity of gravity dams/spillways;
(x) To compare the design parameters with those realized in the
field, and suggest modifications, if any, required in the
design parameters;



122
ANNEX 7
Page 2
(xi) To review the quality control procedures being followed in
the construction of the dam;
(xii) To review the proposed filling and operating criteria from
the standpoint of dam safety;
(xiii)  To review operation, maintenance and safety criteria and
procedures proposed to be used after initial filling; and
(xiv) To advise on flood warning systems in catchment area of
dams.
2.        All the necessary data and information required by the panel, for
review of the various items listed above will be furnished by the Irrigation
Department. Additional investigation studies, laboratory testing, model
experiments, etc., which in the opinion of the panel are necessary will also
be undertaken by the Irrigation Department.
3.        The panel will submit a written report containing their review
comments and recommendations within sixty days following each convening of
the panel. This report should be made available to IDA for review and to
such bodies within the Government of India which may be assigned safety-of-
dam responsibilities.

RESETTLEMENT
1.        GOMP is in the process of formulating new guidelines for the reset-
tlement of displaced persons. Financial compensation for acquired lands and
property is made in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act of 1894 and the Land Acquisition Manual. The principles and procedures
for resettlement and rehabilitation are, however, not yet covered by clear
guidelines. Recognizing the need for a more definitive policy, in September
1979, GOMP established a Committee of Secretaries under the chairmanship of
the Cnief Secretary to establish policies and guidelines. Two working groups
have been set u= c'-r'= for drafting a "Resettlement of Project-displaced
Persons Act"; and the second for establishing organizational requirements.
2.        The first group has drafted an act which is designed to:
(a) ensure, as a minimum, fair compensation to the displaced
for their losses;
(b) elicit a participatory response of both displaced and host
populations for minimizing hardship and rebuilding viable
communities; and
(c)  promote further economic and social development in the
newly resettled communities.
The principal intention in the proposed act is that persons displaced due to
a project would not only be compensated for their losses, but also receive a
share of the benefits from the project. Displaced persons would be provided
with irrigated land in or near the command area, or with land immediately
adjacent to the reservoir (if they prefer to stay near their previous resi-
dence); they would be compensated at replacement value for the loss of
household and community assets where these are not already provided in the
new location. Also, those owning land, but not living in the submergence
area, would be similarly compensated.
3.        It is proposed that the rehabilitation of the displaced persons
be organized by the Department of Rehabilitation. This Department would be
strengthened at the State level and units would be created in the field
under project resettlement officers to carry out the work, which until
recently, was handled by the District Collectors under the Revenue Department.
Rehabilitation Committees at the Divisional Commissioner's level have been
set up, and would include Members of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly
representing the affected area. It is proposed that this Committee would
advise the project resettlement officers, and would ensure that:



124
ANNEX 8
Page 2
(a) the affected people are informed and educated, with a review
to obtaining their cooperation;
(b) the affected people participate directly in the planning
and implementation of resettlement;
(c) the hosts are also involved in the resettlement procedures
so that equitable treatment is accorded as far as possible
to both hosts and settlers;
(d) the emergence of recognized community leaders is encouraged,
to increase participation, stimulate local initiative and
facilitate the task of resettlement;
(e) visits are arranged to the new sites in advance of at least
some members of the settler families; and
(f) a workable plan for resettlement is prepared, providing
for departure areas, arrival areas and transportation.
4.        As a part of the preparation report of each MIP, GOMP would provide
a detailed resettlement and rehabilitation plan following the principles and
guidelines outlined above. This plan would be based on the findings of the
Rehabilitation Committees, and backed up by a socio-economic survey of the
affected population. The socio-economic survey is likely to be entrusted to
local consultants, while a separate planning unit is being set up in the
office of the ID's Engineer-in-Chief, under a Senior Forest Officer. This
unit would have the responsibility for preparing the resettlement and rehabi-
litation plans for each MIP submitted for funding under the project.
