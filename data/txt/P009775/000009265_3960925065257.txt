MADHYA PRADESH MEDIUM IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1108-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Madhya Pradesh
Medium Irrigation Project in India for which Credit 1108-IN in the amount of SDRs
112.6 million was approved on March 17, 1981. The credit was closed on March 31,
1988, one year behind schedule. The last disbursement was made on November 22,
1988 and the undisbursed balance of SDRs 5.979 million was cancelled.
The project was co-financed by an IFAD loan (IFAD Loan No. 81) for SDRs
21.9 million which was fully disbursed on March 31, 1988, one year behind
schedule.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III of the PCR were
prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the Asia Regional Office. The
Borrower prepared Part II and contributed comments on Parts I and III.  IFAD
comments on the PCR were invited on February 12, 1990, but none was received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's project
completion mission in May 1988, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The project's objectives were to increase irrigation potential in the
cultivable command area, improve water management practices through field trials
and demonstrations, improve yield/flood estimates for medium irrigation projects
(MIPs), and establish a central sediment studies laboratory (para. 4).
Implementation Experience
2.    Central Water Commission's (CWC) appraisal of MIPs was methodical but not
always up to Bank's standards. CWC's method of determining projects' economic
viability were not consistent with that of the Bank's (para. 13). Appraisal by
CWC of the project consultants were inadequate; (para. 17). While construction
was weak, quality control by the Irrigation Department (ID) for larger MIPs was
satisfactory, but deficient for the more remote and smaller ones. The Irrigation
Department undcrutilized the services of the Dam Review Panel (DRP) and DRP's
compliance reporting was weak. Close Bank supervision brought about significant
improvements in these areas (para 19). Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R)
of oustees was unsatisfactory and land acquisition for canal works was delayed
(para. 20).   Implementation problems could have been minimized by a strong
project management (para. 21).
Results
3.    The project did not achieve its physical target of creating irrigation
potential (para 23).  The installation of rainfall and river flow recording
gauges had achieved its revised targets (para. 24). The estimated economic rate
of return fell from 18Z at appraisal to 5.1Z at completion (para. 25) due to cost
escalation, increase in land prices, and delays. Under present criteria, MIPs
are not viable development options, even though they may serve social and poverty
reduction interests (para. 26).
Sustainability
4.    Updated designs and improved construction and quality control standards
should be able to sustain the MIPs over their accepted life expectancy. However,
close attention should be paid to efficient water management, maintenance and
improved agricultural practices (para. 27).



iii
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.    The main lessons learned are:
(i)   More preparation work in establishing institutional capability,
responsibility, coordination and accountability, could have avoided project
delays (para 12a and b);
(ii) Dam Safety requirements should have been more rigorous and DRP review
panel staff more independent (para. 12d);
(iii) R&R administration and management should have been staffed by a more
senior official (para. 12e).
(iv) There should have been a more careful selection process for project
consultants (para 12f).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I
PROJECT REIVEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Name:          Madhya Pradesh Medium Irrigation Project
Credit Number: 1108-IN
RVP Unit:      Asia Region
Country:       India
Sector:        Agriculture
Subsector:     Irrigation
Background
1.        Madhya Pradesh is the largest State in India geographically, and in 1981
had a population of 52 M, giving it a much lower population density than most other
Indian States.   The  State is rich in minerals and  forests,  and agriculture
contributed some 552 of State Domestic Product.   MP has a high hydro-electric
generation capacity, and is one of the few states in India without power constraints.
Its population was about 84? rural, with 20? comprising tribals and backward classes.
In 1979, some 66Z of the population was below the poverty line.
2.        In order to increase agricultural production and to make it less dependent
on the variable rainfall, the State has since Independence given the highest priority
to irrigation development. In 1980, only 2.2 M ha had been provided with irrigation
facilities out of an estimated potential of about 12.9 H ha.  Medium irrigation
projects play a particularly important role in areas of limited surface water
resources, in that they exploit small rivers in backward areas.
3.        In the 1970's, GOI developed the concept of Command Area Development (CAD)
in response to the slow gestation rate of newly developed irLigation projects, and
low production generally. Authorities were created, which were intended to focus
on the lower echelons of irrigation systems to carry out on farm development (OFD),
to organize and train farmers, and to facilitate supplies of inputs.   In MP, a
separate CAD (Ayacut) Department exists, whereas certain other States have evolved
a structure where the CAD element is the operating wing of the Irrigation Department
(ID).

Proiect Objectives and Description
4.        The principal project objectives were:
a)   To finance a five year time slice of MIP development over between 25 and
30 MIP's, and create an irrigation potential of about 107,000 ha CCA;
b)   to establish four water management pilot areas of about 200 ha each in
representative agro-climatic zones to demonstrate improved water management
practices;
c)   to establish four demonstration farms of about 40 ha each in representative
agro-climatic zones in order to conduct trials and demonstrations of on
farm irrigation and husbandry practices; and
d)   to instal river and rain gauging stations on MIP's in representative hydro-
meteorological zones in MP to assist in improved yield/flood estimations
for MIP's, and to establish a central sediment studies laboratory.
5.        Project physical  indicators are given in Table 4, and project cost
estimates in Table 5A, Part III.  Both pertain to time slice targets only.  From
these, it is noted that at appraisal, the project cost estimate was Rs. 1950 M (USS
232.1 M). Only three MIP's were formally appraised by the Bank, based on which the
procedures and criteria for selection, appraisal by CWC, and approval by the Bank
for the remaining MIP's to be included were prescribed. A number of studies was
defined under the project, which are listed and described in Table 6D, Part III.
The financing plan for the project, indicating both IDA Credit and IFAD Loan, is
shown in Table SB, Part III.
Project Design and Organization
6.        The project was very thoroughly prepared by the Bank, in that many Bank
staff and consultants visited MP prior to appraisal to carry out in depth studies
and assessments of GOMP's preparation activities. The procedures for MIP selection
and CWC appraisal of MIP's were clearly prescribed, which included the requirement
that the Bank should take part in appraisal should the MIP exceed 10,000 ha CCA.
Design procedures, including investigations (engineering, soil, socio-economic etc.),
irrigation systems,  and dams and their safety were laid down.   Operation and
maintenance procedures were indicated. The appraisal was thorough, but the SAR was
excessively brief and lacking in technical detail in the absence of a technical
Supplementary Data Volume (SDV). Throughout preparation and appraisal, GOMP gave
the fullest cooperation and support.
7.        The project was to be executed entirely by the Irrigation Department of
MP. No specific manager was appointed to control and direct it, and all selection,
preparation, construction and operation/maintenance was under the chief engineer of
the zone in which the HIP was located. All designs except those for dams and major
structures were the responsibility of the respective chief engineers.   The only
central unit was the creation of a Project Preparation and Monitoring (PPM) cell
which was to scrutinise all preparation documents before being passed for MIP
appraisal by CWC. The dams and major structures were to be designed by BODHI (the
central design, hydrology, and investigations wing of the ID).   The Agriculture



3
Department  (AD) was  allotted  only a minor  role  in project preparation,  the
establishment of demonstration farms, and in provision of extensv'n services under
the normal state system.
8.        Dam safety requirements and specifications were particularly inadequately
defined.  Specifications for spillway design in Annex 1 are contrary to those laid
down by the Indian Standards I.-titute (ISI), in that the SAR suggests that empirical
methods may be used instead of accepted analytical methods based on storm estimates.
The terms of reference for the Dam Review ?anel (DRP) given in Annex 7 were however
adequate.
9.        A further serious weakness in the SAR was the requirements for planning
and executing R & R activities. Only one paragraph was included in the SAR on the
subject. However, at Credit negotiations, GOMP assured the Bank that legislation was
to be introduced for application to project related oustees (displaced persons),
which the Bank accepted in good faith.
10.       As the project micronet systems (below 40 ha) were to be designed and
installed by ID instead of Ayacut Department, the Bank considered that ID did not
have adequate trained and experienced staff to design such a large command area
(107,000 ha) during the project period.  It therefore specified that GOMP should
retain private consulting firms to assist ID. It was not appreciated that irrigation
consultancy was (and still is) very weak in India, and the serious delays experienced
by the project in micronet development are largely due to the failure of the majority
of these consultants.
11.       The project was not innovative in design with resp  ; to dam and canal
system, and was based on standard engineering practices. However, below the 40 ha
level, the structured layout, area proportional supply controlled irrigation system
was specified to improve equity and reliability. The descriptions and specifications
of each project component given in the SAR are inadequate in general to be used by
project engineers as detailed design criteria, but they are nevertheless useful
guidelines and should have been adequate guidance with supplemental information.
The scope of the project is however well defined, as are the various procedures.
12.       In retrospect, perceived weaknesses in project formulation and organisation
are:
a)   The project should have been placed under the direct responsibility of a
Special Chief Engineer, answerable only to the Engineer in Chief, ID,
rather than being placed under zonal chief engineers. This would have
ensured consistency of designs and procedures.
b)   Under such Special Chief Engineer should have been placed the following
units:
- PPM cell
- R & R Planning and Monitoring cell
- Quality Control division
- Hydrology and Dam Safety division
- Canal System Design division
- Microsystem and OFD Design division



4
These specialist units would have scrutinised and moderated plans and
designs carried out by the field circlea to ensure correctness and
consistency.
c)   The project should have been located in specified districts instead of
being scattered over the whole State.   This would have significantly
improved ID management and st .ervision, and would have reduced Bank
supervision inputs.
d)   Dam Safety requirements should have been considerably more rigorous, with
specified minimum periods between site inspections, critical stage
inspections, design scrutiny, and ID compliance. The zonal chief engineers
should have had no position of influence on the DRP recommendations.
e)   R & R should have been placed under State administration and management,
with a senior IAS officer of Secretary status with overall responsibility
channelling implementation of relocation, compensation etc. through the
District Collectors. The R & R cell proposed in (b) above would have acted
as a design and monitoring unit only.
f)   More enquiry should have been made into the competence and capacity of the
irrigation consulting industry in India before making the development of
irrigation potential dependent upon it..
Project Impleme-.--ation
13.       The appraisal process by CWC was methodical,  but not always to the
standards required by the Bank. In many cases, the Bank required additional surveys,
data and analysis.   A major point of dispute was the practice of CWC to use
benefit:cost ratio format of economic viability, whereas the Bank required economic
rate of return format.   In certain cases, the Bank could not approve the MIP's
following reworking of the economic analysis. In R & R aspects, the appraisals were
particularly weak.
14.       It is recalled that projects in excess of 10,000 ha were to be also
appraised by the Bank.  This by GOI norms makes them major projects.  Several of
these we-e submitted to the Bank, but only Kolar MIP (45,07 ha) was accepted into
the pro -amme. The remainder were all 10,000 ha or less. Reference to Table 4, Part
III gives the command area for each MIP.
15.       Only three MIP's were appraised by the Bank at project appraisal, namely
Dejla Dewada, Chhirpani and Gomukh. Following effectiveness, a further nine MIP's
were submitted by CWC, and were eventually approved, namely Kolar, Hatiyari,
Chandora, Bundala, Kaliasote, Choral, Tillar, Matiamoti and Gunghutta. These were
reviewed by  an  early Bank  supervision mission  in March  1982.   After much
correspondence and Bank consideration, a further four, namely Budhna, Kanhargaon,
Dudhi and Barnai were accepted into the pro6ramme up to August 1984. Thereafter no
additional MIP's above the sixteen were accepted.



5
16.       Both GOI and GOMP pressed the Bank to accept a further six HIP's.  This
the Bank declined to do, for the following reasons:
a)   The area commanded by the approved 16 HIP's amounted to 127.597 ha,
compared w.lth a target of 107,000 ha under the project.
b)   The R & R plans for the further six were found to be inadequate in spite
of numerous attempts by GOMP to improve them. It should be noted that the
Bank itself, following increasing awareness of the inadequacies of R & R
in India generally, was applying progressively more stringent criteria.
c)   An analysis of costs in 1985 by the Bank is not shown in this report
produced specific costs far in excess of those derived at appraisal. The
latter was estimated to be about Rs. 16,600/ha on average. but revised
analysis indicated more than double this amount. Thus the adoption of the
further six HIP's would have resulted, had the original prograrme of
development been followed, in a large number of partly developed HIP's with
inadequate funds to provide sufficient disnet, micronet and OFD works
completion to create the required productive potential.
17.       Project designs were variable.  In general, as is customary in India, dam
designs were appropriate and competent, with two exceptions:
-    yield hydrology was very tenuous, affecting the dam sizing (really an
economic indicator); and
-    flood hydrology, in that spillway design and capacity were based largely
on the empirical Dicken's Formula with a coefficient considered adequate
to represent a 1000 year flood.
Main canal and disnet designs were also adequate, but in cases their structures were
incorrectly sited and dev'gned hydraulically. The micronet/OFD designs carried out
by consultants were with Xwo exceptions of very poor standard, demonstrating a lack
of understanding of the principles of warabundi/RWS and structured, ungated,
proportional layouts. Subsequently, ID took over the survey and design and to assist
it, the Bank provided, under technical assistance, its consultants to train and
advise ID staff. As all designs except dams were by zonal chief engineers' staff,
these lacked consistency, and this has been referred to in para 10 above.
18.       Construction standards were also variable.   Again, the dams and large
structures were in general acceptable, with certain notable exceptions positively
reported in Bank supervision reports. These instances were due mainly to weak site
supervision. Main canal and disnet construction quality was moderate, again with
exceptions. What little micronet/OFD construction in progress during the project
period was in general of poor quality and durability. Quality control by ID was again
variable between HIP's.   On the larger HIP's, QC staff and laboratories were
satisfactory. On the more remote, smaller HIP's, they were seriotsly deficient.
The Bank throughout the project period kept quality under close review, and through
its reports and ID cooperation standards improved significantly.



6
19.       Dam safety was a major concern throughout the project period.  Although
the DRP was constituted by competent experts in their disciplines, ID seriously
under-utilized their services. Designs were not generally submitted for review prior
to finalisation, and site visits were at unacceptably long intervals, and did not
always coincide with critical construction stages such as foundation exposure. A
major weakness in DRP reporting was the inclusion of the zonal chief engineers as
conveners, which it is suspected reduced the incisiveness of panel observations and
criticism. Compliance reports by ID field circles were invariably very delayed and
not  always  appropriate.    Following consistent  Bank  representations,  a marked
improvement was brought about. In particular, ID carried out a complete review of
flood hydrology using modern analytical techniques at the insistence of the Bank as
a condition for Credit extension. Emanating from this, the DRP made recommendations
for improved safety measures where these were indicated to the satisfaction of the
Bank.
20.       By far the most unsatisfactory aspect of the project implementation was
R & R of dam oustees. This may be considered to be due to the following:
-    very limited reference in the SAR;
-    the absence of a senior IAS official at state level to be responsible;
-    the lack of involvement by district administrations;
-    the lack of a project R & R cell;
-    the remote nature of MIP sites;
-    the lack of clear State policy on R&R;
-    the inability to proceed according to the MP Resettlement Act 1985 as rules
to apply the Act had never been promulgated.
The last point is of particular importance, as GOMP had assured the Bank at Credit
negotiations that the Act was being introduced and would be the vehicle for R & R
activities under the project. In the event, it was never applied. Bank supervision
of R & R were nany and intense, as Table 8B indicates in Part III.  In spite of
repeated representations to GOMP, especially with respect to the physical relocation
of oustees, little perceptible improvement resulted.  As a consequence, the Bank
declined to grant a second Credit extension beyond March 31, 1988.
21.       Mention should be made of the very tardy processing of land acquisition
for canal works by Revenue Department staff.  In many cases, payments were made
several years after the lands had been released, causing hardship to the farmers.
In addition, on many HIP's forest land (whether it carried trees or not) was not
released by Ministry of Forests and Environment, in spite of frequent GOMP requests.
These significantly affected the progress of main canal, disnet, and microsystem
installation.   In retrospect, most of the shortcomings in project implementation
could have been minimized by a strong project specific management, working within
the additiornal organisational/technical parameters referred to in para 15 above.
22.       The schedule of disbursements under the Credit is shown in Table 3, Part
III. This demonstrates the slow project mobilization. Status of covenants is shown
in Table 7, Part III.  In general, with the exceptions of R & R, dam safety, and
quality of construction. the covenants were in full or satisfactory partial
compliance. A very positive aspect of the project was the staffing and operation
of the PPM cell.  Its production of complete and high quality periodic progress
reports was exemplary.

Project Results
23.       The project did not achieve its targets with respect to creation of
irrigation potential, in that only about 3200 ha had been installed at the revised
closure date, compared with a target of 107,000 ha at appraisal. Reference to Table
10, Part III indicates that only one MIP will be fully operational by mid 1990, and
that most will not achieve this until mid 1993. Reference to Table 4, Part III shows
the stage of completion of MIP components vis-a-vis appraisal targets. From this,
it is noted that out of 16 MIP's, 11 dams are more than 80Z completed, which is most
satisfactory.   The achievements in canal and OFD construction by contrast are
seriously in arrears.
24.       The four Water Management Areas (WMA) and the four Demonstration Farmis (DF)
are completed or nearing completion, but no results have been published to date on
trials carried out on them. The installation of rainfall and river flow recording
gauges has substantially achieved the revised targets.   Other aspects of hydro-
meteorology have been absorbed under MP Major Irrigation Project Credit 1177-IN.
These and other studies are described in Table 6D, Part III.
25.       Project direct benefits are indicated in Table 6A, Part III.   Due to
serious delays in project implementation and modification to components since
appraised, the analysis has been based on full development potential of 172,617 ha
instead of the time-slice project target of 107,000 ha. Thus the two situations are
not fully comparable. However, if proportional correction is applied, it is see n
that for every parameter the revised "with project" benefits much exceed appraised
estimates. Economic rates of return estimated at appraised. at mid-term review in
1987, and in September 1989 are given in Table 6B, Part III. From this, it is noted
that a marked deterioration has occurred with a reduction in overall ERR from 182
at appraisal to 5.1Z in 1989. This is due mainly to increased in costs overall, to
the emphasis placed on heavy expenditure items such as dams, and to the very delayed
buildings in production.
26.       Estimated HIP overall costs at full development are listed in Table 9, Part
III.  Of great concern is the large rise in cost per hectare estimate from Rs.
16,600/ha in 1982 to Rs. 37,900/ha in 1989.  Even with coat escalation of 7Z per
annum, this should not have exceeded Rs. 27,000/ha based on appraisal estimates.
It is now known that at appraisal, unit construction rates some three years out of
date were used by ID in price estimates, partially explaining the exceptional
increase. A further factor is the large isicrease in land compensation prices. Thus,
it would appear that MIP's are not with present criteria viable development options,
even though they undoubtedly serve social and poverty reduction interests.
Project Sustainability
27.       Following completion of the MIP's,  incorporating updated design and
construction practices, they should be sustainable over the normally accepted project
life expectancy for projects of this type. It will be important to ensure efficient
water management both from dam/system and on farm aspects, and it is essential that
the agricultural extension services focus on improved husbandry/water application
techniques.

Bank Performance
28.       Throughout the project cycle, the Bank has supplied an exceptionally large
technical assistance/supervision input to the project, as demonstrated by Table 8B,
Part III.   At preparation,  Bank technical  staff and consultants  assisted ID
significantly in design, hydrology and agricultural aspects, and CWC with appraisal
criteria.  During supervision, Bank technical assistance in the fields of system
design, dam safety, OFD/RWS, and quality control has helped to raise the standard
of these components. Only in R & R has the Bank failed, in spite of substantial
staff inputs, to improve the poor performance of ..OMP. It has already been noted
above that due to the very wide dispersion of HIP's within the state, it was very
difficult within staffing constraints to give adequate Bank supervision to each HIP.
Borrower Performance
29.       In the aspects of dam design and construction, studies, and monitoring,
ID demonstrated acceptable standards and diligence.  The standards of design and
construction j$ main canals and distribution systems were variable depending on the
skills and managements of the local circles. Quality control and dam safety aspects,
so inadequate initially, showed improvement following Bank representation. ID also
demonstrated  its  commitment  to hydro-meteorology  improvements.    Due  to GOMP
restrictions throughout, ID was severely constrained in its supervision activities,
especially on canal works, by very inadequate transport facilities for its staff.
In spite of repeated Bank representations, this did not improve.
30.       The ID demonstrated strong management at State level, which invariably
ronsidered Bank supervision recommendations and observations.   As the chain of
command reached to divisional level in the zonal administration, so quality and
dedication declined. GOMP has overall a sound cadre of irrigation engineers, but
their effectiveness was suppressed in many instances by lack of consistent standards,
wide dispersion, lack of facilities, and political interference at site level.
31.       CWC carried out appralsal of MIP's in an overly proforma manner, without
applying subjective judgement in many instances.   Bank reviewers were generally
obliged to request additional data and analysis before being in a position to
consider MIP's for inclusion. Invariably, R & R aspects were treated superficially.
CWC also had a supervision and monitoring role, defined in Schedule 3 of the DCA.
Although its engineers carried out site visits, reporting was tardy and very
proforma, with little incisiveness or critical comment, and overly positive. Many
technical and institutional issues, such as dam safety weaknesses or R & R
inadequacies, were not addressed.  As a result, the bank was obliged to increase
its supervision inputs to the high levels indicated in Table 8B of Part III in order
to adequately monitor progress and to identify salient issues and problems.
Project Relationships
32.       Throughout,  GOMP agencies  and the Bank maintained the most cordial
relationships, which enabled frank presentation by each side of matters of concern.
In technical aspects, ID and CWC invariably considered Bank observations fully, and
ensured that their concerned engineers took the appropriate actions. This created
an atmosphere of professional association which was one of the strengths of the
project.



9
Consultancy and ContractinR Services
33.       Consultants were only utilized, at Bank insistence, on microsystem/OFD
layout and design. Only two of the numerous firms retained were able to demonstrate
competence and diligence, and the remainder were terminated by GOMP.
34.       Contractors were utilized for all project works, except where ID took
departmental action on abandoned contracts. In general, the contractors for dams
and larger canal components were competent and diligent, with one major exception
on Kanhargaon spillway contract.  Contractors utilized on microsystem works were
invariably of inadequate capability, producing low quality works.
Project Documentation and Data
35.       In general the legal covenants were appropriate and adequate.  The SAR
provided a good framework for project execution, but it lacked technical detail.
36.       ID was requested to prepare a PCR to the previous format at Credit closure
in April 1988, and the Bank provided guidelines and examples. To date, no action
appears to have been taken on this. The PPM cell provided assistance to the Bank
team preparing the PCR to the revised format, but this was somewhat tardy.

BARLTIS
PROECT  RRVIEW  FROM  BORROWER'S  PERSPECTI
(a)   Confirm the adequacy and accuracy of the factual information contained
in Part III of the PCR.
Please refer observations under Part III.
(b)   Comments on the analysis contained in Part I of the PCR.
Please refer observations under Part III.
(c)   Evaluate the Bank's performance during the evaluation and implementation
of the Project, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
relevant for the future.
Bank personnel were recognized as professional experts.   The Mission
Members were highly qualified in respective fields and visited site
often during implementation. The Dam Review Panel visited project sites
and held field discussions practically every year.   The works were
executed according to suggestions/recommendations of the Mission experts
and Dam Review Panel.   It is further suggested that communications
between the Bank and the borrower  including the  accounting and
reimbursement of loan procedure should be sufficiently well documented
so that the changes in the project officer or Mission personnel will not
effect the continuity of work.
(d)   Evaluate the Borrower's  ,wn performance during the evolution and
implementation of the pro   ', with special emphasis on lessons learned
that may be relevant for t... future.
The performance of participating institutions in overall project
planning  was  quite  good.    The  implementation  of  specialist
assistance/management for improvement in planning were carried out with
little or no problem.   However,  it was observed that in some sub-
projects the head work was completed wi rn the time schedule but there
was delay in execution of canal system. Dela- was mainly due to delay
in acquisition of land required for canal L stem and time taken in
clearance of forest land cases by Government of India.



11
In some cases, contract agencies also failed to complete tha work as per
schedule which delayed the completion of canal works.   To avoid
recurrence, future works should be awarded to consultants with proven
competence and dependability.
Progress on some of these sub-projects suffered due to frequent transfer
of staff and shortage of inspection vehicle.
(e)   Assess the effectiveness of the relationship between the Bank and the
Borrower during the evaluation and implementation of the project.
Relationship between the Bank and Borrower during evaluation and
implementation was very effective.  Whenever, clarification, guidance
from the Mission was sought it was promptly received.   The Appraisal
Team laid down design criteria and broad specifications to be adopted in
the sub-projects included in the M.P. Med'um Project loan scheme after
detailed discussion in the meetings with officers of M.P. Irrigation
Department. The criteria thus evolved was adopted in the preparation of
Appraisal report and in the implementation of the project.   The Bank
Mission visited several sub-projects to assess the performance during
construction.   This was very effective in achieving high standards of
construction.
(f)   Evaluation the performance of co-financiers and assess the effectiveness
of their relationship with the borrower during the evaluation and
implementation of the project.
In M.P. Medium Project, the co-financing was available from IFAD to the
extent of 21.9 M.SDR vide their loan Credit No. 81-IN.  The IFAD loan
credit has been fully utilized.   The relationship with the IFAD and
State Government during evaluation and implementation was very cordial
and effective.

Para 29      12.    The. project could not be completed in time slics agree
with the bank due to the reasons stated above. The
delay coused due to certain adminiatrative and
construction difficulties *.g. forest clearance from
Oovt. of India. additional requirement of bank on JR6&
issue# increase in cost of land compensatLon. failure
of. consultants and construction agencies etc. Thus the
price escalation resulted in the hither rate of cost
per ha. The project* will undoubtedly proved boon to
the beneficiaries and soCaO economic interests.

which started irrigation.
Para 31       14.    Bank Mrformaglost
We recognile contribution of the Bank as demonstrated
by Table 8..E, Part Ill. We do not agree that the Bank
bas failedl In regard to R&R. Their effort had been
significantly responsible to improve the implementatic
of R&R measures by ID G00W. It is true that Medium
irrigation Projects are widely dispersed within the
State but due to the owareness ia inculcated in the
Project Xanagers due to the Bank's effort and
continuous monitoring by it-v it did help in bringing
about satisfactory implementation of A&R within the
limitetions/constrains faced by the Department.
Para 32.       15.   ,orrower serformances
In the normal circumstances Govt. of M.P. X.D. would
have likejS to provide the inspection vehicle as per
