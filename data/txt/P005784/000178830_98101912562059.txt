STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
YENEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SANA'A URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Urban Development in the Yemen Arab Republic
Urbanization Trends
1.01     Urban growth in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) is a relatively
recent phenomenon beginning in the early 1970s. Whereas the total resident
population of the YAR, estimated at about 5.3 million in 1975 has grown at
about 2.9% per year over the last decade to about 6.0 million in 1980, the
total urban population 11 estimated at about 365,000 in 1975 has grown at
about 7.7% per year over the same period, to about 530,000 in 1980.
1.02     Urban population is fairly evenly distributed.  A widely dispersed
rural population, rugged topography and deeply rooted traditions of
regional autonomy have combined to avoid the overwhelming primacy of any
one city. Three cities, Sana'a, the capital, Hodeida, the country's main
port, and Taiz, the principal southern trading city had 1980 populations of
210,000, 120,000 and 110,000 respectively, and accounted for more than 80%
of the total 1980 urban population.
1.03     The main factor explaining the growth of urbanization in Yemen is
the migration to cities of single males who leave their families in the
country. This trend has been triggered by the rapid development of urban-
based modern sector activities mostly financed by cash income from workers'
remittances.  These remittances increased steeply after the oil boom of
1974 as an increasing number of Yemenis, mostly male workers, went abroad
for jobs. In 1975, 8-14% of the population lived abroad as short-term
migrants and at least 19% of the country's labor force of 1.4 million
worked abroad.
1.04     The rate of future urbanization in the YAR is determined by the
national rate of population growth, industrial sector policies pursued by
the national government, the rate of short-term international migration of
Yemeni labor, and the willingness of single males in cities to stay sep-
arated from their families for long periods of time. Higher population
growth, lower international emigration rates, and migration of entire
families to cities are all distinct possibilities and point to increasing
urban growth pressures. Currently about 8.5% of the population live in
urban areas but this percentage is likely to increase to 21% by the year
2000, if present trends continue. At that time YAR resident population is
expected to reach 10.6 million of which 2.2 million will be urban.
1/ Defined as population living in settlements of 10,000 inhabitants or
more.



-2-
Administration
1.05     The Yemen Arab Republic is divided into 11 governorates, each of
which is administered by a governor who is a political appointee. Govern-
orates are local authorities and constitute administrative subdivisions of
the country. Major urban areas are organized into municipalities which are
essentially local representatives of the Ministry of Municipalities and
Housing. Municipalities are headed by "director generals" who are admi-
nistratively under the governor and are appointed by the central government.
1.06     At the central level, responsibility for managing urban develop-
ment is divided among four entities: (a) the Central Planning Organization
(CPO) responsible for coordinating sectoral development policies with
broader national development strategies; (b) the Ministry of Municipalities
and Housing (MMH) responsible for the formulation of national urban policy;
(c the Ministry of Electricity, Water and Sewerage (MEWS) responsible for
the provision of (i) electricity through the Yemen General Electricity
Corporation (YGEC) and (ii) water supply and sewerage facilities through
the National Water and Sewerage Authority (NWSA); and (d) the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) responsible for surveying, mapping, roads, construction
of public buildings, and rural water supply.
1.07     At the local level, responsibility for managing urban services is
vested in the municipalities. The scope of these responsibilities,
however, is not clearly defined and varies widely from city to city. As a
rule, municipalities depend almost entirely on the central levels of
government for providing urban services including routine maintenance of
streets, and solid waste collection. Their funding is almost entirely
through central government (investment as well as operating budgets) and
their tax base is virtually nonexistent.
1.08     The functioning of this administrative structure is seriously con-
strained by the shortage of qualified personnel at all levels of government
and especially in urban sector agencies.  Although the number of government
employees increased from about 4,000 in 1962 to 31,300 in 1975, there is
still an extreme shortage of qualified personnel. Only about 2% of govern-
ment employees are university educated. Moreover, public sector salaries
have not kept pace with inflation, especially with the cost of housing,
which has made it difficult for government to compete with the private
sector for qualified personnel.
Urban Employment and Income
1.09     Recent developments have considerably changed the level of income
in the YAR. Since the quadrupling of international oil prices at the
beginning of 1974, there has been an unprecedented increase in personal
cash incomes based mainly on remittances from Yemenis working in the oil-
rich countries. Net remittances are estimated to have risen from US$4O
million in 1969-70 to more than US$1.0 billion in 1977-78. This large
influx of remittances combined with a vigorous expansion of public develop-
ment expenditures has (i) resulted in an annual increase of real GDP of



-3-
about 8.5% from 1969-70 to 1976-77 and an even higher increase in the
growth rate of GNP, and (ii) generated massive employment opportuni-
ties 1/ particularly in the construction sector, and created an intense
demand for labor.
1.10     The high level of prosperity and full employment even among un-
skilled workers, has resulted in high levels of income. The absolute urban
povertv threshold as computed in accordance with Bank methodology was
estimated at about YRls 1,650 (IJS$366) per household per month in 1980.
About 33% of the total 1980 urban population had incomes below the absolute
poverty threshold.
Infrastructure
1.11     The most striking feature of the urban setting in YAR is the lack
of infrastructure. Almost non-existent until the early 1970s, the develop-
ment of infrastructure is now receiving increasing attention.  However,
only about 30% of the urban population has access to potable water. There
are no sewer systems yet in operation in the country and major cities lack
adequate vehicular and pedestrian access as well as stormwater drainage
facilities. Solid waste collection is poor and city streets are usually
littered with a substantial amount of uncollected garbage. Health care and
education services, although better in urban areas than rural areas, are
inadequate. As a result of these shortages of facilities, low income
groups must rely on private undertakings (such as water vendors) to get
access to urban services, generally at a cost three to five times higher
than that charged by utility companies.
1.12     A number of factors impairs the efficiency of the infrastructure
sector. Government has still to set up adequate recovery mechanisms
either direct, through appropriate tariffs, or indirect, through taxation.
Lack of administrative planning has led to a lack of coordination in
planning urban development and providing infrastructure, and shortage of
qualified personnel has been the cause of inefficient utilization of the
health and school facilities.
Housing Conditions and Policies
1.13     The housing delivery system in YAR is seriously constrained by;
(a) the absence of a formal land registration system; (b) the rising cost
of housing and building materials and (c) the scarcity of mortgage money.
Rapid political change in YAR has hardly altered the basis of property law,
which remains based on tribal-based customs.  No sales or transfers are
formally surveyed and property locations are identified against other
1/ Open national unemployment was measured at only 5% of the labor force
in the 1975 census.

existing properties. The lack of cadaster and modern ownership registry
has substantially increased the uncertainty of tenure in rapidly expanding
urban areas. There is often a proliferation of conflicting deeds for the
same or overlapping properties involving different groups, agencies or
individuals. Deeds are of various legal status, some traditional, some
delivered by Municipalities or Ministries. The respective legal weight
carried by these various deeds is uncertain.
1.14     Lack of clear ownership of urban land has created a number of
problems. It has undermined the urban planning effort of MMH and the
establishment of an effective real estate taxation system. It has not
prevented the development of land since the absence of a well established
legal title has provided urban dwellers with the certainty that their deeds
(whatever their legal status) could not be seriously challenged. Land
development, however, has occurred in a very haphazard way, complicating
the task of providing infrastructure.
1.15     Housing in YAR has been traditionally of good quality in compari-
son with other developing countries. Materials and workmanship are good
and space standards are high. Traditionally Yemeni have built 4-6 story
houses usually on hill tops largely for security reasons; wall construction
consists of cut stone to the lower three stories with brickwalls for the
upper stories. In recent years the tradition was continued, but wall con-
struction has frequently involved an outer skin of stone backed by cement
blocks.  In addition, a reinforced concrete frame has been provided to
carry the upper floors. This method involves considerable redundancy as
the double wall skin is load bearing in itself.  Because of this, the high
cost of labor, the poor efficiency of local building contractors and the
high demand for housing, the cost of housing and building materials has
escalated sharply since 1975 and particularly between 1975 and 1978.  The
cost of typical houses of smoothly cut stone has increased almost four-fold
from YR 800/m2 in 1975 to YR 3,000/m2 by mid-1978.  The rising cost of
housing has syphoned off the inflated income of the urban population and
has driven the lowest income groups virtually out of the housing market.
1.16     Access to housing, particularly for low income groups, has been
further constrained by the absence of a well developed housing finance
system. Despite the recent large increase in cash income (para. 1.09),
existing financial institutions have failed to capture these funds partly
due to their limited outreach, the traditional saving behavior of the popu-
lation and the absence of organized saving schemes. A Housing Credit Bank
(HCB) was created in 1977 with an equity of YRls 100 million to provide
mortgage money. To date, only about 900 households, mostly medium to high
income, have benefited from HCB loans. Low income groups rely on informal
sources of finance to gain access to housing. Little is known, however, on
the mechanism which channels available liquid- ity to these groups. The
lowest income groups are usually renters and spend up to 50% of their
income on rent.



Government Shelter Policies and Programs
1.17     The Government of YAR has not yet developed a comprehensive urban
policy partly since the emergence of urban issues is relatively recent. So
far, much government intervention in the urban sector has been on an ad hoc
basis, with various ministries and agencies being involved in the pre-pa-
ation, promotion and implementation of urban related schemes. The Ministry
of Public Works has prepared master plans for five cities including
Sana'a. These master plans concentrate heavily on the physical planning
aspects of urban development and propose standards that are not related to
the financial capacities of the urban institutions nor to their implement-
ation capacity. Furthermore, the absence of adequate laws for land acquis-
ition and registration is impairing the implementation of the plans. The
Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Labor, Sana'a University, the
Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the first Cooperative
Housing Society, all have launched large housing programs with mixed
success. These consist mostly of clusters of 4-5 story walk-up apartments
for a total number of about 5,300 units, of which about half are now
completed. These programs have been plagued with numerous problems
including implementation delays, poor infrastructure planning and cost
overruns. The cost of these units (excluding land and infrastructure)
average about YRls 160,000 and these programs are affordable by only medium
and high income families. The government has also undertaken to stimulate
housing cost reduction by encouraging importation of foreign technologies.
This move however has given rise to a growing concern regarding the ability
of domestic firms to adopt new technologies and to remain competitive with
foreign firms. The government is therefore trying to overcome this problem
by fostering (a) joint ventures of local and foreign firms, (b) the devel-
opment of local contracting industries, and (c) the efficient production of
local building materials.
1.18     The Government has been concerned at the lack of coordination
between these various activities and decided in 1979 to vest all authority
regarding urban development including housing into the Ministry of Munici-
palities and Housing. This ministry has therefore become the focal point
of all govenment decisions in the field of urban development, and its
capacity to implement urban policies and programs would be strengthened
through the proposed project.
IDA Strategy in the Sector
1.19     IDA lending to YAR for the urban infrastructure sector commenced
in 1974 when a Credit (464-YAR) was made to help the Government finance
the first public water supply system for Sana'a. In June 1975 a Credit
(559-YAR) was approved for the financing of the water supply component of
the Hodeida Water Supply and Sewerage Project. This project included the
financing of the Hodeida master plan and the preparation of master plans
for four other cities including Sana'a.  Three additional credits were
granted to YAR in this sector, the latest being for the financing of the
Water Supply and Sewerage Project for Ibb and Dhamar. This involvement was
expanded in 1979 when the Government requested Bank assistance to carry out



a. urban sector review identifying major issues in the urban field.  The
review. concluded inter alia thatn
ka)  the focus of public urban development programs should be on the
develoDment of urban land rather than on the delivery of housing
units, an activity which should be left to private initiative;
(b)  Government's programs should be targeted to the lowest income
groups, including in the field of housing finance;
(c)  the Government should take a leading role in sponsoring programs
aiming at strengthening local building contractors and encouraging
the use of low-cost builtiing materials and techniques; and
(d)  the above activities would require the development of an institu-
tional capacity to acquire and register land and to implement
integrated urban developyient projects.
The findings of this review, whichi was completed in December 1980 (Yemen
Arab Republic; Urban Sector Report - No. 2699 YAR), were thoroughly
discussed with the Yemeni authorities. A review of the construction
indu stry has also been initiated in 1980 under the Unido/World Bank coop-
erative program. Both reviews forim the basis for the proposed project.
These reviews are also being used as an input in the drafting of the
1982-1986 developmlent plan for whi.ch government has requested IDA assist-
arnc e.
1.20     Sana'a, the capital city and seat of government was chosen as the
site for the proposed project for essentially two reasons; (a) as one of
the fastest growing cities in YAR, Sana'a is experiencing a range of urban
problems which are typical of other cities in the country, and (b) the
exiscence of all major decision centers in the project city will ensure
close monitoring of the project by all agencies concerned and therefore
facilitate future urban policy fonmulation as a result of the experience
gained under this first proiect.
B. The Project City; Sana'a
1X21     Sana'a has developed as the political and administrative center of
the YAR,  Although Taiz was the principal capital of the Iman until 1962,
Sana'a was the center of the revolutionary conflict in the 1960s and became
the capital after the revolution. It is the largest city in YAR with a
980 population of about 210,000 and grew at a rate of about 8% over the
1975-80 period. The city's population is expected to grow at the same rate
during the next five years. This implies an annual increase of about
17,000 people (3,000 households) of whom about 25% would be below the urban
poverty threshold.
'1,212   Government administration remains the economic base of the city.
About 50% of Sana'a's jobs are generated in this sector. Trade comes next
Xn importance (20% of Sana'a's jobs) followed by building and construction



- 7 -
(17% of Sana'a's jobs). Industry only occupies fourth place with 7% of the
jobs. This structure points to an economic base heavily skewed in favor of
services, particularly government services. The efforts of the government
to generate industrial jobs have been frustrated by the high cost of labor
and the scarcity of skills necessary to operate capital intensive plants.
1.23     Housing and infrastructure conditions in Sana'a vary widely in
quality among the various neighborhoods.  The old city of Sana'a with
buildings of five to six story high, dating back to the fifteenth century
is poorly serviced. Water is drawn from private wells and there is no
sewer or garbage collection service. Roads are narrow and unsurfaced. The
north and southwest parts of the city are usually well developed with the
best buildings clustered along the main infrastructure network. The rising
cost of land in these areas has pushed low income groups to the northeast
and southeast part of the city which extends over the gently rising slope
of the Jebel Nugum. About 40% of the total population of Sana'a is
presently living in these areas which are deprived of basic infrastructure,
particularly sewerage and surfaced roads.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01     The proposed project is conceived as a demonstration project
including components which are tailored to the implementing capacity of the
executing agencies. Its main objectives are to assist the government in;
(a) focusing its intervention on the development of urban land and the
provision of infrastructure for the lowest income groups;
(b) strengthening and encouraging local contractors and individual
home builders to use cost effective building materials and con-
struction techniques; and
(c) reinforcing the existing institutional framework in order to
implement this approach more systematically in the long-run.

2.03       US$1.9 million (7.2% of total project cost) for project prepar-
ation and administration should be added to the above elements, bringing
the total project cost to US$26 million. Summary cost estimates are given
in Table 3.1 and discussed in Chapter III.

C. Detailed Description
Upgrading and Site and Services Component
2.04     The main objective of this component is to assist government in
focusing its intervention in the urban sector on the cost effective devel-
opment of land, and on the provision of infrastructure in low income
settlements.
Muzaik Upgrading
2.05     The area of Muzaik comprises a population of 19,800 people
presently living in 2,360 dwellings. As pressures on land are increasing,
the area is continuously expanding and will contain about 2,600 buildings
and a population of about 22,000 people by 1985. The site covers 68
hectares and is very poorly serviced. About 40% of the inhabitants have
incomes below the absolute poverty threshold and the median monthly house-
hold income is about YRls 1,800 (US$400). Land is privately owned. A
socio-economic survey undertaken in 1981 as part of the feasibility study
(on a 10% sample basis) has shown that 75% of the inhabitants of Muzaik
claim ownership to land and buildings, though only 80% of those who claim
ownership could produce some sort of evidence. The remaining one fourth
are tenants.
2.06     Location and Topography.  The site has several locational advan-
tages. It is about one km to the northeast of the old city, one of the
major sources of employment. It is well served by access roads and near
major trunk infrastructure (Map IBRD 16031). The ground is undulating and
drains in the direction of the Wadi Saila. Slopes are relatively steep in
the eastern portion of the area, some grades exceeding 10%. Approximately
two meters of sandy soil overlay the bedrock.
2.07     Existing Conditions.  The three existing access roads are paved
but need resurfacing. All interior streets are unpaved and badly rutted.
A well defined system of blocks exists in the western portion, thus allow-
ing for easy circulation, but as land becomes steeper to the east, roads
become narrower and access increasingly difficult. No drainage system
exists in the area and run-off from the steeply sloping areas causes
considerable erosion and surface damage. A new water distribution system
has been recently completed and NWSA has engaged in a house connection
program aimed at ensuring that all houses in the project area will have
individual connections by 1984. Approximately 70% of the dwellings possess
cesspits which are generally not maintained and overflow into the streets.
The remainder of the population disposes of wastes and waste waters
directly to the streets. About 90% of the households have individual
electricity connections. Most of these connections are illegal. They were
installed prior to the setting up of the electricity company (YGEC) which
now strictly controls these connections. No street lighting exists. In
the absence of a solid waste collection service except in some main
streets, interior streets and alleys are littered with garbage, thus

increasing public health risks. Existing housing is of mixed quality con-
struction making use of locally produced building materials such as mud
bricks and cut stones.  Buildings are one to three story high and occupied
by single families. Extensions and improvements of houses are evident and
new construction on infill plots are developing in the eastern portion of
the area.
2.08     Proposed Improvements.  The following improvements will be im-
plemented under the project, with minimum destruction of buildings or dis-
placement of families (Further details on design standards are given in
Annex I).
(a) delivery of land titles through the land registration program
(para. 2.24);
(b) improving the level of infrastructure (Map IBRD 16032). The road
system will include 2,480m of primary and 2,530m of secondary
local roads which will be surfaced with a 7.5 and 5.0 cm layer of
asphalt, respectively. Sidewalks would be provided with a 10cm
gravel surface. All service roads and footpaths will be graded
and compacted with gravel only. Storm water drainage will be
provided through lined open canals. A water-borne sewerage system
designed to serve the entire area will be built. Alternative
system of sanitation would not be feasible because of the high
risk of contamination of the water table which provides water to
the whole city of Sana'a. Design standards and materials for the
system will be compatible with those recommended under the Sana'a
Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 464 YAR). Once
connected to water (para. 2.07) houses will have individual sewer
connections. Off-site sewerage works would only include the
construction of 1,300 m of a main collector to the Wadi Saila
sewer interceptor. The construction of this interceptor is
included under Phase I of the Sana'a Second Water Supply and
Sewerage Project. Tendering of Phase I of the project is being
carried out. Contracts would be awarded by the end of 1981 and it
is anticipated that the interceptor and treatment works should be
operational by 1984. Street lighting will be provided in primary,
secondary and off-site access streets only. The on-going Sana'a
solid waste collection scheme (Annex VI) is scheduled to cover the
Muzaik area.  No garbage collection equipment will be provided
under the project since this equipment has been already procured
by MMH. During negotiations the Government provided assurances
that the solid waste collection scheme will be extended to the
area of Muzaik by December 31, 1982.
(c) provision of credit facilities (construction loans) from HCB for
home improvement and/or extension (para. 2.20).



Sawad Sawan Site and Services
2.09     A site and services scheme would be developed at Sawad Sawan.  The
site is about 1.5 km to the north of Muzaik and one km from the Mareb road
(Map IBRD 16031). Land is owned by the Government and was officially
transferred from the Land Department to MMH during project preparation.
Evidence of land transfer is satisfactory to IDA. Access is along unpaved
tracks. Of a total area of about 43 hectares, 25 hectares will be devel-
oped under the project to accommodate approximately 1,980 low-income house-
holds, or 11,100 people. This would leave about 18 hectares of adjacent
land and approximately 60 hectares of other public owned land, excluding
the vast waqf holdings, on which replication of the project would be
possible. The 25 hectares site has been selected on the basis of proxi-
mity of suitable employment, accessibility to existing asphalted roads and
efficient use of existing or planned off-site infrastructure. Several
on-going and planned improvement projects will directly benefit the site.
As in Muzaik, sewage will be discharged to the Wadi Saila interceptor sewer
to be constructed under Phase I of the Sana'a Second Water Supply and
Sewerage Project. A 40mnm main along the northern boundary of Muzaik is
now being installed with provision in the form of blanked off tees, for
supply of water to future developments. This will provide adequate water
pressure and capacity to meet the demand in Sawad Sawan when the site would
be fully developed. With respect to power supply, a contract for the con-
struction of a 33KV power transmission line from the Rawdah substation to a
substation to be located south of Sawad Sawan, has already been awarded.
Construction is expected to be completed by mid-1982. This will provide an
adequate source of high voltage supply for the site.
2.10     Site Layout and Land Use.  The site layout has been designed so as
to ensure a cost effective use of land and infrastructure (Map IBRD 16033).
Most residential plots would be provided with pedestrian access only.
Primary and secondary roads network will provide vehicular access to within
50 meters of every plot, with larger plots having direct vehicular access.
Areas will be reserved for community facilities (primary schools and
mosques) and for commercial development. Land use distribution is as
follows:
(ha)       %
A. Marketable Area (to which costs are allocated)
- Residential area                                      15.84      62.2
- Commercial area                                         1.64      6.5
- Community facilities                                    0.42      1.7
Sub-Total A;                                           17.90     70.4
B. Non-Marketable Area (to which costs are not allocated)
- Circulation and parking                                 6.86     27.0
- Parks and open space                                   0.64       2.6
Sub-Total B.                                             7.50     29.6
C.  Grand Total (A+B)                                        25.40    100.0



- 12 -
2.11     Levels of Infrastructure Provision.  All primary (615m) and
secondary (1,240m) roads will be surfaced with one layer of asphalt and
provided with compacted sidewalks. All service roads and pedestrian paths
will be compacted. All plots will have individual water and sewerage
connections. One inspection chamber will serve two plots. Stormwater
drainage will be provided through open lined canals. An electricity system
will be built and individual electricity connections provided.  Six new
500kVA transformer stations will serve this system.  All streets and
pedestrian paths will have street lighting supported on the same poles
carrying the electricity system.  Since the on-going Sana'a solid waste
collection scheme does not cover the area, equipment has been included for
garbage collection. Garbage bins located at a maximum walking distance of
lOOm from each plot would be procured as well as one compacting truck with
a capacity of 15m3. The Government has agreed that MMH will operate and
maintain the solid waste collection and street cleaning scheme in Sawad
Sawan. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotia-
tions.
2.12     Off-site infrastructure requirements will include;
-    1,350n of a 250mm water transmission line from the 400mm water
supply main North of Muzaik and construction of a ground reservoir
of 700m3 capacity.
-    2,800m of a 30Omm trunk sewer to the Wadi Saila interceptor.
-    880m of llkV underground cables.
Further details on design standards are given in Annex I.
2.13     About 1,980 plots would be developed and three plot sizes
provided; 72 m2, 80 m2 and 96 m2. With the exception of the demonstration
houses (para 2.16), no superstructure would be provided on the plots. On
entering into contract with MMH, to purchase a plot, the plot beneficiaries
will be provided with a choice of standard house plans. Plot beneficiaries
will be given a maximum period of two years to start construction after
plot allocation.
2.14     About 925 beneficiaries are expected to take up a loan for con-
structing their dwelling (para. 2.20).
Pilot Shelter and Housing Finance Scheme
2.15     This project component aims at (a) reducing the cost of housing by
strengthening the executing capacity of local contractors and encouraging
local contractors and individual home builders to use low cost locally
produced building materials and construction techniques; and (b) improving
access to formal mortgage financing for low income groups.  To achieve the
above objectives, the project includes:



- 13 -
2.16     Demonstration Houses.  One hundred and forty-two demonstration
houses would be built in the site and services area on two basic standard
layout modules, each including 71 plots and adjacent to the commercial area
(see Map IBRD 16033). The full development of two basic modules would
provide (a) an example of the internal space organization within and
between basic modules, (b) a core of construction which would help stim-
ulate further site development, (c) a large spectrum of house types demon-
strating the feasibility of building a single skin load bearing wall
capable of vertical extension to two stories without jeopardizing secu-
rity and comfort (para 1.15) and (d) a building component of a size large
enough to influence through appropriate contract packaging and technical
assistance the productivity of local contractors (para 3.10).
2.17     Two types of demonstration houses would be built, each at four
different stages of development. The smallest unit would be 25.7 m2 and
would include two rooms and a sanitary core. The largest unit would be
87 m2, two story high (each story with two rooms), a sanitary core and a
kitchen. All structural components would be built to support a second
story. The house design would respect local traditions and custom for
privacy.
2.18     In order to achieve cost reduction, houses would be erected using
low cost locally produced building materials such as burned bricks and
hollow cement blocks, and will conform to low-cost building techniques.
Further cost reduction would be achieved through appropriate contract
packaging of this component in order to attract srmall contractors (para.
3.10) and through the provision of technical assistance to the successful
bidders to increase their productivity (para. 2.19). Typical construction
costs of the proposed demonstration houses would be about YRls 1,300 per
square meter, i.e. between 30% to 50% below the current market price (para.
1.15). Cost per housing unit (including contingencies) will range from
US$10,500 for the smallest type to US$34,000 for the largest type. These
houses would be auctioned off by MMH after completion. Project benefi-
ciaries are expected to build over time and in stages similar
cost-efficient houses. Further details on house sizes, types and costs are
given in Annex II.
2.19     Building Advisory Services to Project Beneficiaries and Small
Contractors. A building construction specialist will be financed under the
project for a period of two years. He will join the Project Unit (para.
5.03) in January 1983. Assurances to this effect were obtained at nego-
tiations. This expert will design procurement packages attractive to local
contractors and give advice to project beneficiaries and to contractors on
the appropriate use of low-cost building materials and construction tech-
niques, and on on-site construction management. He will be thoroughly
briefed on the findings of IDA supported studies on the construction
industry (para. 1.19) and will consult with IDA on its proposals to assist
local contractors and individual home builders. Terms of reference for
this position were agreed upon at negotiations.



- 14 -
2.20     Credit Facilities to Beneficiaries.  The project includes a line
of credit of YRIs 22.5 million (US$5 million) for construction loans to
project beneficiaries. The size of this sub-component takes into account
(a) the potential demand for home extension, improvement, and construction
in Muzaik and Sawad Sawan (b) the existing administrative capacity of HCB
to process loans and (c) the ability of the beneficiaries to pay. Con-
struction loans would be optional and the maximum amount that beneficiaries
will be allowed to borrow would be YRls 30,000 in Sawad Sawan and YRls
20,000 in Muzaik. These amounts correspond to the cost (labor and
materials) required for building two to three rooms of lOm2 each, using
low-cost building materials and construction techniques. Credit facilities
would be earmarked for those beneficiaries whose incomes are below the 35th
percentile of the income distribution curve in Sana'a. It is expected that
350 and 925 beneficiaries will take up this option in Muzaik and Sawad
Sawan, respectively.
2.21     Housing Finance Advisory Services.  HCB will be responsible for
administering the line of credit for construction loans (para 5.08). In
order to assist HCB in processing such loans and to strengthen its capabi-
lities in providing mortgage financing to low-income groups, the project
includes the financing of one housing finance expert for two years. This
expert who will be recruited by the Project Unit will join HCB in July
1983. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. Terms
of reference for this position were agreed upon at negotiations.
Institutional Development Component
2.22     In order to provide MMH with the capability to execute and expand
the above programs, consultancy and advisory services for a total of 18
man-years would be provided to the MMH for the following purposes:
2.23     Land Registration.  The project includes 3.5 man-years of technical
assistance in the area of land registration. Two phases have been identi-
fied in the provision of this assistance.
2.24     Phase I, initiated with PPF funds, would (i) focus on the identi-
fication of all plot owners in Muzaik, on the delineation of their respect-
ive property, and on the establishment of the land tenure pattern in the
area; and (ii) identify land registration procedures including the design
of title deeds, which would meet the requirements of a modern land regis-
tration system, while at the same time respecting some features of the
current customary system (e.g. identification of property through both
coordinates and adjacent properties). Land registration procedures would
likely be similar to those established under the Torrens system. This
system is suited to the limited implementation capacity of MMH and can be
extended to other areas without requiring immediate ground surveying of
such areas. Under this system, land titles benefit from public guarantee
and compensation for title registered under it is granted if such titles
are successfully challenged in court. Property rights in Sawad Sawan and
Muzaik would be recorded according to the newly proposed system and new
title deeds would be delivered to plot owners once they have paid off the
improvement charge (para 4.08).



- 15 -
2.25     Phase I is expected to take about 1.5 years, exclusive of the work
already done under project preparation. One full-time land registration
expert to join the Project Unit in July 1982 would be provided during
phases I and II (3 man-years). A team of 5 surveyors including a chief
surveyor would be made available in July 1982 by the Physical Planning
Department of MMH to the project unit for the identification and
delineation of properties in Muzaik. In addition, two vehicles and field
equipment would be acquired. A public information campaign financed under
the project (0.5 man-year of Public Relations Expert) will be launched in
early 1983 to reach landowners in Muzaik.
2.26     Phase II would take about 1.5 years and would consist of the moni-
toring of Phase I and the preparation of legislation necessary to expand
the land registration scheme developed under Phase I on a national basis.
The responsibility of the various government agencies for the delivery of
land title would be established. Once agreement is reached on the agency
ultimately responsible for land registration, a core of legislation aiming
at acquiring, registering and recording land on a unified basis would be
prepared. A similar core of legislation would be proposed to convert
traditional deeds into new deeds. An insurance fund might be established
to provide the new deeds with a public guarantee. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Government will recruit by March 1982 a
land registration expert and will implement in accordance with procedures
and regulations satisfactory to IDA a formal land registration system.
Terms of reference for this position were agreed upon at negotiations.
Assurances were also obtained that the Government will exchange views
regularly with the Association on the progress of implementation of such
system.
2.27     Project Execution.  The project includes the provision of 14.5
man-years of consultant and advisory services to assist MMH in executing
the proposed project. The amount of technical assistance has been tailored
specifically to the needs of MMH taking into account its limited implement-
ation capacity. Technical assistance will be provided as follows:
Length of                      Expected Date
Expert         Number      Assignment    Man-years         of Assignment
Project Manager    1         4 years          4           Already in place
Engineer            2        3 years          6           March 1982
Financial Analyst  1         2.5 years        2.5        March 1982
Socio-Economist    1         2 years          2          March 1982
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the above
experts will be recruited by the dates mentioned above. Terms of reference
for the above experts were agreed upon during negotiations.
2.28     Training and Preparation of Future Projects.  Funds (US$37,000)
are earmarked for training the counterpart staff of the Project Implement-
ation Unit. Training opportunities under the form of short training
sessions abroad will be offered in procurement and disbursement procedures,
use of low cost building materials and construction techniques, and



- 16 -
land registration. Training courses and places have been identified. In
addition, on the job training will be provided by the technical assistance
team. US$600,000 is included for financing the preparation of a possible
second urban development project.
III   PROJECT COSTS EXECUTION AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01     Total project cost, including contingencies (Government projects
are exempted from duties and taxes) is estimated at YR 117.0 million
(US$26.0 million) with a foreign exchange component of YR 65.5 million
(US414.6 million) or 56% of project costs. This high percentage of foreign
exchange is explained by the large amount of technical assistance provided
under the project and the high cost of imported materials for infra-
structure works. Summary cost estimates are given in Table 3-1 and
detailed cost estimates in Tables 1 to 6, Annex III. The base cost
estimates are in November 1981 prices, forecasted from June 1981 prices.
Cost estimates are based on.
(a) detailed design for the sewerage component in Muzaik and advanced
engineering design for all other components;
(b) unit costs for similar infrastructure works currently under
execution in Sana'a; and
(c) prices obtained from the Ministry of Public Works, NWSA, and civil
works contractors.
3.02     Consultant services to be provided under the project amount to
US35.13 million (see Annex III, Table 3) including; (a) 2.99 million for
project management and execution; (b) 0.64 million for building construc-
tion advisory services and assistance to HCB; and (c) 1.5 million for
project preparation including PPF. The average man-month cost of expa-
triate consultants, including salary, fees, insurance, international travel
and subsistence, is expected to be about US$12,200 including contingencies.
3.03     Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of infra-
structure costs for site and services and upgrading, and 15% for the
demonstration houses. No physical contingencies have been included for
construction loans and technical assistance. Price contingencies take into
account the projected implementation schedule and likely increase in
services, construction costs, materials and equipment during the execution
of the project. For domestically procured civil works, a price increase of
25% has been estimated for 1981, 22% for 1982, 20% for 1983 and 1984 and
17% per annum thereafter. These increases are based on detailed price

studies for civil works construction and materials carried out by the IDA
Project Implementation Unit established under the First Education Project
(Credit 421-YAR) and an analysis of price increase trends in Sana'a. They
are consistent with those used for IDA supported projects in YAR. For
internationally procured equipment, materials and civil works, a price
increase of 9% has been estimated for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, and 7.5% per
annum thereafter. These increases follow guideline rates. Total
contingencies represent 29.7% of the base costs and 22.9% of the total
project costs.
B. Execution and Maintenance
3.04     Detailed engineering for both sites are completed and tender
documents are expected to be ready by March 1982. Tenders would be invited
in April 1982. Works are expected to commence by January 1983. The
project would be implemented in about 26 months.  The expected completion
date for the project is March 31, 1985 with an additional eight-month
period for completion of payments and withdrawal of the credit proceeds.
An exception would be the construction loans component of the project for
which the completion date is June 1987. The closing date would be December
31, 1987. The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex IV.
3.05     The Housing Department within MMH and the Housing Credit Bank
would be the executing agencies with overall project responsibility (see
Chapter V).  All contracts (civil works, equipment and advisory services)
will be let by MMH and supervised by MMH in collaboration with NWSA and
YGEC when warranted. After project completion, the infrastructure will be
transferred to the respective utility agencies (NWSA and YGEC) which will
be responsible for operation and maintenance. Annual maintenance costs are
expected to total about US$643,000 for infrastructure representing 4-5% of
capital costs.  These would be borne by MMH for roads, drainage, solid
waste collection and street lighting (US$360,000), NWSA for water and
sewerage (US$230,000), and YGEC for electricity (US$50,000). MMH mainte-
nance activities would be carried out by its implementation office within
its Physical Planning Department. The department is well staffed and has
the financial means to maintain project infrastructure. As for NWSA and
YGEC, additional maintenance costs under the project represent only 4% and
0.2% respectively of their 1980 operating budget.  Therefore, this
maintenance activity is well within the current maintenance capacity of the
concerned agencies. Agreements between MMH and NWSA, and MMH and YGEC on
the administrative arrangements for (i) providing technical supervision
during project execution, and (ii) operating and maintaining the relevant
infrastructure provided under the project were submitted to IDA for review
during negotiations, and are satisfactory to IDA.

C. Financing
3.06     An IDA credit of US$15.0 million is proposed to finance (i) the
entire foreign exchange cost (US$14.55 million) of the project, and (ii)
the local cost (US$0.45 million) of the technical assistance component.
The balance of the project cost (US$11.0 million) would be financed by the
Government. The project financing plan is as follows;
US$ Million Equivalent    YRls  Million Equivalent
Sources of Finance        Local   Foreign   Total       Local  Foreign  Total
Government of YAR        11.0         -        11.0      49.5       -     49.5
IDA                       0.4         14.6    15.0        2.0    65.5    67.5
Total                11.4         14.6    26.0       51.5    65.5   117.0
3.07     The IDA credit would be made to the YAR Government under standard
IDA terms and conditions. The Government would pass on part of the
proceeds of the credit (US$12.5 million) and part of its own contribution
(US$8.5 million) to the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing for the
implementation of the upgrading, sites and services, demonstration houses
and related technical assistance components of the project 1/.
1/ To simplify financial matters the Housing finance expert would be on
the payroll of MMH.



20 -
The Government would onlend the balance (US$2.5 million IDA credit and
US$2.5 million counterpart funds) at 8% per annum (plus 1% service fee)
over 10 years to the Housing Credit Bank for the provision of construction
loans. The Government will be requested to make an advance of US$250,000
to HCB, as soon as needed but not later than June 30, 1984, and the
Association will disburse an amount equivalent to 50% of the loans made
under the project. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
3.08     Counterpart funds needed to finance the project will not exceed
YRIs 19.6 million in any one year. However, lags between payments to con-
tractors and repayments by IDA would create a maximum treasury need of YRls
30.1 million in 1984. This maximum treasury need represents 0.7% of the
1981 government budgeted revenues.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.09     Civil works for the upgrading and site and services components of
the project, totaling YRls 52.2 million (US$11.6 million) and consisting of
roads, footpaths, water supply, sewers, stormwater drainage, electricity
and street lighting, and preparation and servicing of plots at Sawad Sawan,
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with guidelines for procurement under IDA credits. These would be procured
through a general contractor for both sites, or one for each site, who
would be responsible for hiring specialized contractors for the installa-
tion of water supply, sewerage and electricity. Prequalification would be
required. For materials and equipment procured separately through ICB, for
bid evaluation purposes, a 15 percent margin of preference or an amount
equal to custom duties, whichever is lower, would be applied to bids
offering locally manufactured goods.
3.10     Contracts for demonstration houses, amounting to YRls 13.5 million
(US$3 million), would be procured on the basis of locally advertised
competitive bidding in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA.
International competitive bidding has not been proposed for those contracts
since the size and nature of the work, i.e. use of low cost construction
techniques and utilization of low cost building materials, are not likely
to attract foreign contractors including those currently active in Yemen.
However, foreign bidders will have the opportunity to participate.
Local competitive bidding would thus support one of the objectives of the
project: the development of the productivity of local contracting firms
and of their capability to execute low cost housing projects.  In order to
attract a wide range of local contractors, the contracts for this
component would be broken down in small packages ranging from US$100,000 to
US$500,000.  Civil works for demonstration houses are subject to public
tenders in accordance with Law 3 of 1975 and any contract exceeding
YRIs 300,000 (US$67,000) in value (i.e. all contracts under this component)



- 21 -
will be decided upon by the Supreme Procurement Committee. This procedure
is satisfactory to IDA.
3.11     Procurement of goods costing less than YRIs 900,000 (US$200,000)
each, whose aggregate value will not exceed YRls 2.2 million (US$500,000)
(i.e. equivalent to all equipment to be procured under the project), would
be permitted in accordance with international limited tendering by inviting
quotations from at least three international suppliers. Such goods (mainly
solid waste collection equipment and electrical transformers) would be
procured as part of on-going programs. Limited tendering will therefore
ensure conformity in standards while maintaining price competition.
3.12     Construction loans for a total of YRls 22.5 million (US$5 million)
would be awarded to project beneficiaries by the Housing Credit Bank (para.
2.20). Consultant services amounting to YRls 23.1 million (US$5.13
million) would be procured by the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing.
MMH will employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment will be satisfactory to IDA, and such employment
will be made in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA.
3.13     Retroactive financing for a total of YRls 3 million (US4670,000)
was approved to cover the cost of detailed engineering and miscellaneous
expenses of the Project Unit. A PPF advance of US$480,000 has been made
already to cover project preparation costs and start up expenditures for
the project unit.
Disbursement
3.14     Disbursement from the IDA credit proceeds would be made on the
following terms:
(a)  50% of total expenditures for civil work contracts;
(b) 40% of total expenditure for demonstration houses;
(c) 50% for the line of credit for construction loans disbursed
against statement of expenditures;
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment, or 100% of
local expenditures ex-factory or 70% of local expenditures for
other goods locally purchased; and
(e) 100% of expenditure for consultants' services including PPF
advance.
3.15     The estimated disbursement schedule based on the estimated
schedule of expenditure is shown in Table 3.3. The disbursement schedule
takes into account the disbursement profile of IDA supported projects in
YAR which involve a large amount of civil work construction.  The profile
reflects a disbursement period of 7 years.  Delays experienced in the past
were often due to delays in provision of counterpart funds. Recent
discussions between government and IDA have resulted in the establishment
by Government of a revolving fund to insure an adequate and timely
provision of counterpart funds. Therefore, the disbursement profile has
been adjusted accordingly. In particular, the disbursement period has been



- 22 -
shortened to five and a half years.  A provision of 6 months for project
effectiveness and a provision of 6 months for credit withdrawal processing
have been included. Disbursements will be fully documented except for
expenditures made under statement of expenditures. Documentation for
expenditures under statement of expenditures will be retained by HCB for
review by IDA representatives. Any undisbursed balance at the end of the
project implementation period would, with prior approval of the
Association, be disbursed through the Housing Credit Bank to provide
further construction loans, if the demand warrants. Otherwise, any surplus
arising at the completion of the project would be cancelled.

E. Accounts and Audits
3.16     Accounting standards within MMI are not suited to the financial
monitoring of the proposed project. Namely, income and expenditure cate-
gories are too broad and accounting is done on a cash basis.  To remedy
this, separate project accounts would be established within MMH to record
all project related financial transactions (for which MMH is directly
responsible (para. 3.05)). The project accounts would also include all
operations related to the proposed revolving fund (para. 4.14). Accounting
procedures for the project accounts would be set up by the expatriate
financial analyst proposed under the project (para. 2.27). Expenditures



- 2 3 -
now being incurred through PPF are being recorded in an analytical cash
book kept by the accountant of the Project Implementation Unit. An
independent auditor satisfactory to IDA would audit the project accounts.
He will submit his report to IDA through the Project Unit not later than
eight months after the close of each financial year. Assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiations. The Government also provided
assurances that a separate set of project accounts and accounting
procedures satisfactory to IDA will be set up by December 31, 1982.
3.17     The internal accounting system of the HCB has recently been
amended to confonm to standardized procedures which are appropriate and are
now required of all financial institutions by the Ministry of Economy. HCB
accounts are up to date, mainly because a private auditing company which
has been appointed to audit HCB accounts is helping HCB staff to keep HCB
accounts in order. A separate project account would be set up within HCB
to record all financial transactions related to the construction loans com-
ponent. The housing finance expert (para. 2.21) will help HCB to set up
this account. An independent auditor acceptable to IDA will audit the
account. The auditor's opinion would also cover reimbursement claims by
HCB against statements of expenditures. The auditor will submit his report
to IDA through the Project Unit not later than eight months after the close
of each financial year. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
negotiations.  The Government provided assurances that a separate set of
project accounts and accounting procedures satisfactory to IDA will be set
up by December 31, 1983
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.18     In view of the innovative nature of some of the project compo-
nents, the impact of the project upon beneficiaries would be monitored to
test the response to the various options available under the upgrading and
site and services schemes. Monitoring and evaluation would be the respon-
sibility of the Project Unit which will prepare semi-annual progress
reports for submission to IDA not later than two months after the end of
each semester.  Progress reports would include an evaluation of the
performance of HCB and key indicators of the extent to which the project is
meeting its objectives. Key indicators would include inter alia, infra-
structure maintenance performance, sale of plots, profile of plot benefi-
ciaries and building materials used in project sites, performance of small
contractors and cost recovery impact. The Project Unit would also forward
to IDA the audited project accounts of MMH and HCB (paras. 3.16 and 3.17).
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.



- 24 -
G. Supervision
3.19     IDA supervision of the project would require about 102 man-weeks
over 6 years of project implementation (including the construction loans
component). A large part of the supervision effort (some 54 manweeks)
would be concentrated during the first two years when construction work
will be initiated. The required basic staff would include an engineer, an
architect and a financial analyst.
IV. COST RECOVERY, AFFORDABILITY AND REPLICABILITY
A.  Cost Recovery Principles
4.01     About 79% of total project costs in nominal terms would be
directly recovered from project beneficiaries through improvement charges
(48%), loan repayments (19%) and direct sale (12%).  Of the 21% of project
costs not directly recovered from project beneficiaries, 2% would be
recovered through NWSA and YGEC existing tariffs, and 19% would be borne by
the central government budget.
4.02     Project costs recovered through improvement charges relate to
developing and servicing the residential land. These costs, which would be
fully recovered, include site preparation, land registry survey, on-site
infrastructure, design and supervision, project administration as well as a
provision for default and NWSA coLlection fee (Para 5.07). They will be
computed on a per building basis in the Muzaik area and on a per square
meter basis in the site and services area.  Construction loans would be
recovered through monthly installments paid by those plot allottees
electing to take up this option. Demonstration houses will be auctioned
off.
4.03     Project expenditures not directly recoverable from beneficiaries
but recovered through tariffs include the costs of off-site water supply
and electricity. Other expenditures not recovered but incurred by the
Government include: (a) the cost of technical assistance (except that
related to design and supervision and land registry (para 4.02)); (b)
short-term training and travel, special advisory services and, equipment
and office supplies; and (c) costs of site preparation and on-site infra-
structure required for the areas reserved for primary schools in the site
and services area.
4.04     Particular emphasis has been put on sensitizing the target popula-
tion to the rationale and procedures for cost recovery. A Public Relations
Expert financed under the project (para 2.25) will assist the Project Im-
plementation Unit in organizing information campaigns.
4.05     Cost recovery sources for project components will be as follows:

1] Including downpayments.



- 26 -
B. Lending Conditions to Beneficiaries
4.06     Cost recovery from beneficiaries would entail the following terms
and conditions:
(a)  improvement costs in upgrading and site and services areas;
repayment would be at an interest rate of 11% over a period of 20
years. A downpayment of 20% would be required for all residential
plots in the site and services area.  However, prospective bene-
ficiaries would also be given the option of acquiring plots for
cash or of repaying the cost of improvements within a shorter time
period; and
(b)  construction loans:  repayment would be at an interest rate of 12%
over 10 years.
4.07     The proposed interest rates for residential land and construction
loans (11-12%) are in line with those recently discussed between the Yemen
Arab Republic and IDA for specialized institutions. They represent a sub-
stantial increase as compared to the current rate for housing (7% plus 2%
service charge). As in the case of the other two specialized financial
institutions in YAR, namely the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) and the
Industrial Bank of Yemen (IBY), the Government has agreed that the above
on-lending rates would be periodically reviewed in light of prevailing
market conditions in consultation with IDA.  Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.
C. Cost Recovery Arrangements
4.08     Cost recovery arrangements would be as follows:  On assuming
possession of their plot, prospective owners will enter into an agreement
with MMH under which they will be given a leasehold on their plot.  Upon
full repayment of the improvement costs, beneficiaries would be given a
freehold title. To avoid speculation, plots would not be resold (except to
MM14) before 1990. Installments will be applied to the purchase price which
will be established at the time the agreement is entered into.  In case of
default on payment for three consecutive months, MMH will apply existing
legal remedies to recover the payments, cancel the agreement, and even-
tually evict the plot beneficiary. Repayments from beneficiaries are ex-
pected to start in mid-1984 in Muzaik and in the first quarter of 1985 in
Sawad Sawan.  Collection of payments will be carried out by NWSA staff
according to the procedures described in para 5.07. Terms and conditions
for cost recovery, and arrangements for collection of payments will be
included in the land sale contracts between MMH and the project bene-
ficiaries. Draft contracts for land sale were reviewed during negotiations,
and are satisfactory to IDA.



- 27 -
D. Pricing of Residential Plots
4.09     The pricing policy established for the upgrading and site and
services programs would aim at ensuring: (a) effective overall cost
recovery; and (b) affordability by the existing and intended low-income po-
pulation. In order to achieve these objectives, plots would be differ-
entially priced to reflect location, accessibility, and related levels of
services; plots on prime location bearing a greater share of the infra-
structure cost. In addition, land cost estimated at market value will be
charged to the beneficiaries in the site and services area. Land reserved
for community facilities will be transferred to the relevant Ministry at
development cost whereas land for commercial development will be sold at
market value. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that terms and
conditions for cost recovery from beneficiaries will be as above.
E. Affordability Analysis
4.10     The affordability analysis is based on detailed and reliable
surveys of household incomes and housing expenditures in the project area,
conducted by MMH consultants in 1981 (see income distribution curves in
Annex V).
Muzaik Upgrading. The cost of improvement of the various options would
be affordable to at least 90% of the resident population. This is
based on monthly payments representing between 8% and 10% of the house-
hold incomes depending on their absolute level of income. These
monthly payments correspond to the percentages of income that house-
holds are able and willing to spend for infrastructure improvement over
and above their current housing expenditures. Improvement charges,
monthly repayments and percentiles reached are indicated in Table 4-1.
Sensitivity analysis shows that if household incomes were to increase
by 10% less than costs, the cheapest option would still be affordable
to about 90% of the resident population. During the course of up-
grading particular attention will be given to the lowest 10% of the
resident population (in terms of income level) and appropriate actions
will be taken by MMH to resolve cases of hardship.
Sawad Sawan Site and Services. The household survey indicates that
prospective low-income beneficiaries would be able and willing to spend
about 30% of their income on improvement charges and on repayments for
optional construction loans (para 1.16). The down-payment of 20% would
not exceed 2 months' income equivalent and corresponds to the amount
that households declared they were ready to contribute. The cheapest
plot option inclusive of construction loan repayment would be
affordable to more than 80% of the Sana'a population. It is expected
that the substantial increase in supply of serviced plots will allow
both for internal movement in the housing stock and rental
opportunities, which would also benefit the poorest segments of the
population in Sana'a. Plot options, improvement charges, monthly

repayments and percentiles reached are indicated in Table 4.2. Sensitivity
analysis shows that if household incomes were to increase by 10% less than
costs, the cheapest plot option inclusive of construction loans would be
affordable to about 80% of the population in Sana'a.

F. Beneficiary Selection
4.11     In Muzaik, 40% of the beneficiaries residing in the area have in-
come below the absolute poverty threshold.  Infrastructure improvements
have been tailored to the capacity of the beneficiaries to pay. With
respect to HCB construction loans, priority will be given to households
within the urban poverty group (income less than YRls 1,650/hh/month).
Loan applications will start in June 1984 so that home improvements and/or
extensions run in parallel with infrastructure improvements. Identifica-
tion of beneficiaries for building materials loans will be carried out in
conjunction with Phase I of the land registration exercise from July 1982
to December 1983 (para. 2.25).
4.12     Beneficiary selection criteria for Sawad Sawan site and services
include inter alia the income of beneficiaries. Selection criteria were
agreed upon at negotiations and are satisfactory to IDA. The prime
objective will be to reach a mix of income groups with incomes between the
15th and 50th percentiles of the Sana'a income distribution curve. As in
Muzaik, construction loans will be provided in priority to the urban poor.
G. Replicability
4.13     Financial replicability of the upgrading scheme is feasible for
virtually all the families living in the unserviced areas northeast and
southeast of Sana'a (i.e. 40% of Sana'a 1980 population). Since incomes in
Hodeida and Taiz do not substantially differ from Sana'a's, upgrading could
be repeated in these cities, particularly in Hodeida where large tracts of
land belong to the municipality. Design feature of the Sawad Sawan site
and services are replicable for a wide range of low income urban families,
particularly since government land is available not only in Sana'a but in
other major cities.
4.14     The cost recovery arrangements discussed above will provide
Government with a steady inflow of recovered funds. Since the Government
is encountering difficulties to mobilize funds to finance urban growth
(lack of property tax base, absence of appropriate financial insti-
tutions, etc.), it was agreed that these recovered funds would (i) accrue
to a revolving fund to be administered by MMH and set up within the Central
Bank of Yemen (CBY) before January 1984, and (ii) be made available to
underwrite future similar operations in the urban sector. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations. A cash flow of MMH related
operations is shown in Table 4.3. A year after completion of the physical
components of the project, a cumulative net inflow of YRls 43.8 million
(US49.7 million) would exist, the initial government budget outlays for
project start up having been partly covered by payments from
beneficiaries. This inflow may provide the seed capital for the setting up

of the insurance fund under the Land Registration Program (para. 2.26).
Beginning in 1987 when improvement charge installments are close to the
expected annual yield of about YRls 6.0 million (US$1.3 million), net
annual incremental inflows should reach YRls 2-3 million (US$0.4 to 0.7
million).
4.15     This financial arrangement combined with the strengthening of the
Housing Department would help lay the basis for an expanded and financially
self-supporting urban development program. A prime candidate for this ex-
pansion would be the development of the reserved area of Sawad Sawan (para.
2.09).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01     One objective of the proposed project would be to strengthen the
institutions responsible for urban policy formulation and implementation in
YAR, and lay the institutional basis for expanding low-income urban devel-
opment programs.  To achieve this objective, responsibility for project
execution would be vested in the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
(MMH). An exception to this arrangement would be the administration of the
construction loans component which would be the responsibility of the
Housing Credit Bank (HCB) 1/
A. The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
5.02     The Housing Department of MMH would be primarily responsible for
executing all MMH related project components (para 3.05). This represents
an opportunity to build up the executing capacity of this department and
strengthen that of MMH as a whole, particularly in the field of urban
policy formulation, coordination with other government agencies, and
supervision procedures.
5.03     The Housing Department has been in charge of preparing the pro-
posed project and has been gradually strengthened through the establishment
of a project preparation/implementation unit. This unit currently consists
of an expatriate project manager, three local engineers and an accountant
working closely with an expatriate consulting team in the preparation of
the project. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that
the position of project manager will be filled throughout the project with
an individual whose qualifications are satisfactory to IDA.
1/ Details on MMH and HCB are given in Annex VI.



- 33 -
5.04     To implement the proposed project which will represent a sub-
stantial but manageable increase in the supervision workload of MMH, the
present staff of the Unit would be further strengthened through the pro-
vision of technical assistance (see paras. 2.19, 2.25 and 2.27). Each of
the experts who will join the Unit would be assigned counterparts who would
eventually take over project implementation responsibility. The actual
signature of the technical assistance contract for the two engineers is a
condition for credit effectiveness.
5.05     In close consultation with the Director of the Department of
Housing, the Project Manager will be responsible for directing all aspects
of the execution of the proposed project. Under his direction, the staff
of the project unit will inter alia;
(a)  prepare and supervise, in collaboration with the staff of NWSA and
YGEC when warranted, all infrastructure works including (i)
preparation of bidding documents, (ii) evaluation of bids and
recommendation of awards, and (iii) supervision of construction
and procurement operation, and preparation of procedures for the
receipt of the project components (paras. 2.08 to 2.13);
(b)  prepare, supervise and arrange for the promotion of the demon-
stration houses including (i) bidding documents, (ii) provision of
technical assistance to small building contractors, (iii)
development of an advertising campaign to sensitize project
beneficiaries to the use of low cost building materials and
construction techniques including provision of technical advice to
individual home builders, and (iv) sale of the demonstration
houses (para. 2.18);
(c)  develop a site specific land registration system possibly to be
extended to other areas of Sana'a and to other cities (para. 2.24);
(d)  monitor all physical, financial and administrative aspects of the
project including (i) organization, coordination and control of
any program necessary for the staff training and development
(para. 2.28), (ii) establishment of project accounts (para. 3.16),
and (iii) liaison with IDA, i.e. submission of plans, documents,
progress reports and other material for review and clearance
(para. 3.18)
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the duties and
responsibilities of the project implementation unit will be as above.
5.06     MMH will house a selection committee whose functions would be to
select project beneficiaries. The Minister of MMH will chair the committee
which would include inter alia representatives from the Ministry of Youth
and Social Affairs, and CPO. Each agency member of the selection



- 34 -
committee would make available to MMH an appropriate number of staff to
process beneficiary applications. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that (i) the Selection Committee will be set up six
months before the completion of infrastructure works, and (ii) the staffing
arrangements for processing beneficiary applications will be as above.
5.07     MMH has entrusted NWSA with the collection of the improvement
charges. NWSA was selected as collecting agency since all project
beneficiaries, being connected to water, would have to deal with NWSA. The
selection of another agency to collect the improvement charge would have
required the setting up of a collection unit within this agency and
entailed problems regarding staffing of the collection unit, particularly
in a situation of scarce skilled manpower.  NWSA has the administrative and
staff capacity to collect such charges at minimum additional cost. NWSA
will collect the improvement charge on a monthly basis along with the water
bill. It will keep 3% of the collection proceeds to meet its collection
costs, and remit the balance to MMH. MMH would be responsible for the
enforcement of the payment of such charges and for accountability.
Agreement between MMH and NWSA on the procedures and administrative
arrangements for the collection of the improvement charge was submitted to
IDA for review during negotiations, and is satisfactory to IDA.
B. The Housing Credit Bank
5.08     In close consultation with the Project Implementation Unit, HCB
would be responsible for (i) reviewing loan applications, (ii) determining
applicants' eligibility, and (iii) monitoring and evaluating the
construction loans program. To assist HCB staff in carrying out the above
and to help HCB management design and develop appropriate operating
procedures and policies, the Project Unit will make available to HCB a
housing finance expert for a period of two years, starting in July 1983.
This expert would be responsible for inter alia:
(a) advising HCB's top management on borrowing and lending policies
more responsive to the current financial market conditions,
including the development of savings deposit schemes;
(b) preparing appropriate management reforms to increase staff
productivity including the setting up of in-service training
programs and the preparation of internal system procedures;
(c) participating in the review, monitoring and evaluation of the
construction loans program;
(d) establishing separate project accounts (para. 3.17); and
(e) reviewing internal controls and suggesting methodology for
improving record keeping and collection practices.



- 35 -
5.09     In addition to the expert, two local staff would be necessary to
carry the additional load represented by the processing of the construction
loan component of the project. No special problems are anticipated in
hiring the additional staff since (i) HCB salary scale for local staff is
roughly in line with that of the private sector and (ii) the on-going
recruitment process for the project unit staff has demonstrated the
availability of expatriate financial analysts. Any delay in recruiting
this staff would not seriously hamper project execution since HCB existing
staff could process the construction loans albeit at a slower pace.  During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the expert and the
additional two staff would be recruited by July 1983. Also, assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the Government will consult with IDA on
the new HCB operating policies to be introduced, following the Housing
Finance Expert recommendations.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01     Although the Yemen Arab Republic is not yet faced with
insurmountable urban problems, signs are appearing that the urban situation
is becoming very strained.  The Government has started addressing these
emerging questions as many other governments have done in other developing
countries, i.e. by launching high cost subsidized housing programs not
affordable to the targeted population. The Government, however, is willing
to reconsider its current policies. The time is therefore right for trying
out alternative policies before subsidized housing programs which divert
scarce financial resources from the economy, become a permanent feature of
government intervention in the urban sector.
6.02     The proposed project is designed to make full use of the private
initiative in the housing sector while channelling government intervention
toward removing key bottlenecks in the housing delivery system.
Particularly important in this respect is (a) the development of land in
Sawad Sawan and in the build-up area of Muzaik at very little cost to the
government, (b) the promotion of low-cost materials and cost efficient
building techniques with a view of achieving a 50% reduction in
construction costs, and (c) the strengthening of institutions responsible
for urban policy formulation and implementation. The project is
financially sound.  About 79% of the project costs in nominal terms are
directly recovered, and recovered funds can be used by MMH to promote
similar schemes in other areas.
6.03     The economic rate of return for the upgrading and site and
services component (including demonstration houses and construction loans)
representing 77% of total project cost is estimated at 25%. Rates of
return have not been computed for other components due to the difficulties
in the measurement and quantification of benefits.



- 36 -
Upgrading and Site and Services
6.04     Benefit evaluations in the upgrading and site and services areas
are based on estimates of imputed rental values for housing and market sale
prices for commercial development and demonstration houses. Information
regarding rental values in areas with similar location characteristics was
provided by MMH or obtained through direct survey carried out by the
Project Preparation Unit. The following values were arrived at.
Rental Values in June 1981 Prices

Sawad Sawan Site and Services                  Not applicable            550
6.05     The following project costs were included in the analysis:
(a) site development costs, including land cost at market price, site
preparation and on-site infrastructure costs, (b) the share of off-site
infrastructure allocable to the site, (c) the cost of demonstration houses,
(d) the cost of building materials and related labor, (e) administrative
expenses, design and supervision costs, and physical contingencies, and (f)
annual operation and maintenance costs equivalent to 4-5% of the
infrastructure cost.
6.06     The upgrading and site and services components together would
yield an estimated economic rate of return of 25%. The Upgrading and the
Site and Services schemes would have a return of 24% and 27%,
respectively. Sensitivity analyses of the rates of return gave the
following resultsz

Urban Poverty Impact
6.07     The project would address the needs of the poorest segments of the
population in Sana'a, who have presently little access to serviced land and
mortgage financing. At present, about 25% of households in Sana'a have
incomes below the Bank-defined absolute urban poverty threshold. It is
estimated that 14,350 people falling into this category will directly
benefit from the project, representing 27% of the urban poor in Sana'a.
Improvements provided through slum upgrading would benefit 8,800 people
within this target income group. Under the site and services program,
11,100 people will have access to serviced land. Of these people,
approximately 50% would have income below the absolute urban poverty



- 37 -
threshold.  The line of credit for construction loans would benefit 1,275
households, of which 70% would be urban poor.  Of the total project cost of
US$26 million, 44% or US$11.4 million is attributable to the urban poverty
group (see Annex VII).
Project Risks
6.08     The government commitment to the proposed project and to the
policies it embodies is very strong.  However, since the proposed project
would be the first urban development project initiating alternative
approaches to urban development in YAR, it necessarily faces a number of
risks.
6.09     Because of the institutional weaknesses in the sector including a
serious shortage of qualified administrative and technical staff, the
project could experience delays in execution and important coordination
problems. Such risk has been minimized by (a) basing the implementation
arrangements on existing and staffed institutions which will be
strengthened by advisors and consultants as necessary, and (b) providing
for staff training. Also the signing of the technical assistance contract
for two engineers is a condition for negotiation and the Project Manager,
who participated in the Appraisal of the proposed project, will attend the
negotiations. Moreover, in view of the above risks, the scope of the
project has been kept limited and tailored specifically to the
implementation capacity of the two project implementing agencies, and
disbursement profile accordingly adjusted.
6.10     The current pressures in demand resulting from the shortage of
affordable serviced land in Sana'a could lead to a shift in target
beneficiaries in the site and services area; higher income groups obtaining
urban services targetted to the lower income population. While this risk
cannot be totally eliminated, it has been reduced by (a) establishing
detailed eligibility criteria and procedures for beneficiary selection and
(b) allowing for about 15% of the plots to be allocated to medium income
group, thus releasing partly pressures in demand.
6.11     Cost recovery is politically sensitive and would require
continuing strong government commitment, particularly in Muzaik. Most of
the intended beneficiaries have almost no experience in contracting formal
debt obligations. More importantly, cost recovery performance in Muzaik
will entirely depend on the incentive represented by the conversion of
unsecured land titles into fully registered and secured land titles.
Surveys have indicated that beneficiaries are willing to pay for the
amounts to be recovered in order to obtain secured land titles.  The
socio-economist financed under the project will work closely with the local
community to ensure cost recovery.
6.12     The availability of counterpart funds has been a recurrent problem
in YAR. The counterpart funds required under this project are modest on an
annual basis, but still significant enough to represent a real risk in
project implementation. This risk would be minimized by the recent
creation at the central level of a revolving fund which provides up-front
financing for IDA supported projects (para. 3.15).



- 38 -
6.13     High construction costs in Yemen combined with the difficult
nature of upgrading works could lead to cost overruns under the project.
This risk has been decreased by the particular attention paid to the
estimation of the unit cost for all elements under the project and the
provision of realistic price contingencies for the local cost component of
the project.
Critical Activities and Key Implementation Dates
6.14     The critical activities in the implementation of the project and
the expected dates of completion indicated in the Table 6, will serve as
project implementation and monitoring tool.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
i)    The agreements signed between MMH and NWSA, and MMH and YGEC

Project Executing Agencies
A. The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
1.        MMH was created in March 1979 by separating municipalities from
the former Ministry of Public Works and Municipalities. It is responsible
for urban affairs including planning and administration as well as for the
local municipal offices in each of the governorates (para. 1.05). It is
divided into four departments: Administration and Finance, Physical
Planning, Environmental Health and Housing. (See organization chart on page 2).
2.        Since its creation in 1979, MMH has steadily built up its project
implementation capacity. Through its physical planning department it has
been involved in the implementation of five master plans (para. 1.17) and in
the provision to local municipalities, including that of Sana'a, of a
number of urban services such as drainage, street paving, public markets and
sanitary facilities. Through its Environmental Health Department it has also
been involved in the provision of solid waste collection and disposal services.
A city-wide collection and disposal scheme mostly financed by the Netherlands
and benefiting from Jordanian technical assistance has been launched in Sana'a
and plans have been drawn up for its extension to Hodeida and Taiz. The
annual budget of MMH for construction work is in the range of YRls 40-65 million,
and the Ministry is currently supervising two on-going road construction projects
with a total value of YRls 60 million.
B. The Housing Credit Bank
3.        The Housing Credit Bank (HCB) is a government chartered, specialized
financial institution, created in 1977 to mobilize individual savings and
provide mortgage credit. The bank is under the Ministry of Economy but its
fiscal policy is governed by CBY. The operating policy of HCB is governed by
a ten-man board of directors, seven members of which include ministers and
representatives of CBY, and three public members represent preferred shares
owners. The Board elects a chairman who in turn appoints the general manager
(see organization chart on page 3).  The above organization is under review
by government. HCB has developed during its three years of operation good
experience in mortgage finance directly relevant to the implementation of the
construction loans program.

4.        Since its creation, HCBts loan and investment portfolio has
increased substantially.  At June 30, 19781/there were no loans or invest-
ments in HCB's portfolio. Loans and portfolio amounted to US$6.7 million by
June 30, 1979 and increased to US$10.4 million (up 55%) by June, 1980, and to
US$13.2 million (up 27%) by December of the same year. The increases in loans
and investments, however, have been mostly financed (up to 90%) through capital
contributions from Government (see HCB's balance sheet on page 5). So far HCB
has not made a concerted effort to obtain funds from sources other than Govern-
ment, mostly because its onlending rates (maximum of 11%) cannot cover the
cost of raising money on the capital market (minimum cost of 11%). The heavy
dependence of HCB's operation on free government funds has frustrated HCB's
planning of lending operations and led recently to restricted activity.
5.        Since it started operating, HCB had granted 812 loans through
November 1980. Due to shortage of government money, loan activity for all
of 1981 is programmed at 100 loans for a total of YRls 5 million. HCB makes
two types of loans, personal and commercial. The personal loan is made for
the purchase or construction of a house. The commercial loan is made for home
improvement or enlargement. The current interest rate is 7% (plus 2% adminis-
trative cost) for personal loans plus an additional 1% annual fee on the ori-
ginal amount of the loan for commercial loans. Loan repayment periods do not
exceed 15 years and average 6 years. Under current policy, the maximum loan
is YR 60,000 and a down payment of 30% of the estimated value of the construction
is required. So far most of the loans have benefited public sector employees.
Payment enforcement procedures are adequate and HCB has not had to foreclose on
a borrower.
6.        HCB has a staff of 40, five of whom have educational backgrounds
related to their employment responsibilities. The balance has not achieved
higher level education. As a result, staff productivity is low and HCB profit-
ability is poor as indicated by HCB return on equity of 3.5% in 1980. Govern-
ment recognizes the problems associated with poor staffing and inadequate
financial and operating policies but is reluctant to embark upon major manage-
ment reforms prior to a decision on the new HCB organization. Nevertheless,
government sees the execution of the construction loans program as an opportu-
nity to initiate limited reforms namely on the financial side. The modified
onlending terms and conditions of HCB's loans under the project (para. 4.06)
are a first step in this direction. A cash flow of HCB operations under the
project is shown on page 6.
1/   Until 1980, the Yemeni fiscal year was July 1-June 30.
