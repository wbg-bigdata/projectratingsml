1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     Following the severe 1999 economic and financial crisis, a comprehensive
reform effort let Colombia enter into a sustained period of strong growth, which
supported job creation and poverty reduction. Implementation of sound macro and
microeconomic policy frameworks, improved political stability and security and a
favorable external environment led to sustained economic expansion and moderate
inflation. This period of economic bonanza came to a halt late in 2008 with the advent
of the severe global economic crisis, which is still being felt strongly today worldwide.
2.   The National Development Plans (NDP) formulated by the authorities in
consultation with civil society and supported by the World Bank Country
Partnership Strategies (CPS) guided policy implementation. The NDP 2002-2006,
aimed at four objectives; to improve security; to support sustainable growth; to reduce
income inequality; and to increase the transparency and efficiency of the State. The
2006-2010 NDP added environmental sustainability as a fifth objective. The NDP 2006-
2010 indentified securities market reform as a priority to deepen Colombian financial
markets in order to promote high sustainable growth.
3.    Strengthening the financial sector and developing capital markets had been
at the core of the financial development agenda in the last decade. Such reforms
supported the achievement of the sustainable growth objective. Following the 1999
banking crisis, recovery efforts included addressing insolvent state-owned banks –
through privatization, liquidation or recapitalization–, and deleveraging risk in housing
finance through securitization of the mortgage market. As the situation stabilized, focus
shifted to revamping financial sector regulation and supervision in order to strengthen
financial sector stability. To promote savings and to channel those savings efficiently to
fund private sector investment and foster growth, the NDP 2006-2010 envisioned a
comprehensive reform of the securities market regulatory framework. The government
efforts were extensively supported by the World Bank and other multilaterals through a
number of operations including loans, technical assistance, analytical work and policy
dialogue.
4.    In late 2008, Colombia confronted significant economic challenges deriving
from the severe worldwide financial crisis and requested prompt assistance to the
World Bank. Colombia, as elsewhere in the region, was experiencing a sharp
tightening of financial conditions reflected in lower capital inflows and increased
external borrowing costs1. Therefore, the authorities requested access to fast-disbursing

  In light of the unfavorable global environment and facing a deteriorating fiscal situation, the base
projections were for a mildly negative outlook for GDP growth in 2009 and a weak recovery in 2010 (in
ractice, real GDP actually grew 1.5% in 2009 and 2010 saw a healthy expansion of 4.3%).




                                                  1
budgetary requirements and in this context began the preparation of the reviewed
operation. The intense and sustained dialogue on financial sector issues maintained
with the authorities during the last decade (see Box 1) made possible to quickly prepare
an operation that addressed both with the threats to financial stability posed by the
global environment and the need to continue developing capital markets.
5.     On the domestic front, the growth of financial pyramids schemes posed
financial malaise and social damage. Hundreds of thousands of Colombians had
invested in such schemes, hurting particularly hard those at the lower end of the income
scale 2 . Unregulated investment schemes (UIS) had expanded quickly in Colombia
through a system of referrals by existing members and offered unusually high returns
(up to 300 percent within 6 months). One of the largest schemes, Grupo DMG, had been
in operation for three years, and had over 60 branches in Colombia as well as offices in
Venezuela and Ecuador. DMG operated a sophisticated scheme; it distributed pre-paid
cards which investors could use to buy appliances and consumer electronics from
selected retailers. Customers could also collect points which could be redeemed for cash
after several months. The scheme offered a return of 150–300 percent on this
investment. Customers also became salesmen. It remained current on its obligations for
three years, even after other schemes collapsed. The authorities had been aware of the
existence of such UIS, but taking measures under the existing legal framework proved
difficult3. Even in cases where the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC) was
able to impose precautionary measures, some of the schemes continued to operate by
creating new vehicles different from the ones initially penalized.
6.     Although overall systemic financial stability appeared to be adequate, the
authorities recognized the need to continue to strengthen the foundations of the
Colombian financial system. As highlighted in the Program Document, Colombia’s
financial sector appeared to be sound and well supervised, which had been the result of
a concerted effort in previous years on the part of the government of Colombia (GoC) to
implement far reaching and well structured reforms aimed at strengthening the sector’s
resilience to external and domestic shocks. The authorities promptly took action to
mitigate and contain the negative effects the global crisis by adding to their existing
toolkit by adopting new countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy measures, while
simultaneously increasing funding from multilaterals. In addition, several key measures
supported by the reviewed DPL were implemented to further strengthen the financial
sector.

    The collapse of one pyramid in late 2008 affected over 200 thousand people and led to rioting and
    violent protests in 13 cities in Colombia.

3
    SFC had to extensively document and prove that financial resources were being collected from the
    public over an extended time. Doing so requires accounting information, which is difficult and time
    consuming to collect given the unreliability of the accounting records of the UIS and the intensive use
    of cash that prevailed in such schemes, preventing any traceability of transactions. In addition, in many
    cases sophisticated schemes were designed to resemble legal activities, and this complicated the
    collection of evidence.

Box 1. World Bank Work on Financial Sector Issues in Colombia During the Last
Decade

Several World Bank operations supported the policies of the authorities regarding the financial
sector in the context of a fluid and ongoing policy dialogue with the GoC (2003-2009). Such
dialogue supported and made possible the quick preparation of the reviewed operation.
Some of the key operations in the financial sector area include:

        The Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Series which supported the 2003 Financial
         System Reform Law as well as insurance and pension system reform. The loan series
         also supported the adoption of risk supervision framework, the creation of an
         integrated financial supervisor (the SFC), dismantling of insolvent state banks and
         the approval of the 2005 Securities Law.
        The Business and Productivity and Efficiency DPL series which supported the
         merger between bank and securities supervisors into the SFC, and policies regarding
         (i) access to finance and money market development, (ii) regulations developing
         aspects of the 2005 Securities Law and (iii) the reform of the framework to deal with
         AML/CFT.
        1999 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and the 2005 FSAP
         update.
        Technical Assistance on Financial Competitiveness, which looked at issues of
         financial deepening and competitiveness, including issues related to credit
         information, financial taxation, insolvency procedures and financial sector structure.
        FIRST funded Technical Assistance on Colombia money market development,
         which aimed at strengthening the primary and secondary market for government
         securities. In the context of this project the World Bank provided technical assistance
         in the analysis, design, and implementation and testing of a technological platform
         for the securities borrowing and lending operation.
        FIRST funded Financial Crisis Simulation exercise. The exercise tested how the
         authorities would work together in managing a financial crisis, and provided
         recommendations for follow-up work to strengthen crisis management arrangements
         in Colombia.
        Technical Assistance on Pensions and Financial Sector Deepening which provided
         input regarding (i) the introduction of multifondos schemes for mandatory retirement
         pensions (ii) supervision and regulation of financial conglomerates (iii) consumer
         protection legislation, and (iv) the regulation of OTC markets.


The IFC has also promoted the development of capital markets and access to finance for
underserved sectors. The IFC has sought to increase the efficiency of capital markets and
develop a sound regulatory framework. This has included initiating the first Colombian Peso-
denominated bonds issued by a multilateral financial institution, assisting with the
establishment of Colombia’s first secondary mortgage company, strengthening institutional
investors, and consolidating the domestic capital market with partial credit guarantees for
corporate bonds as well as debt and equity facilities to leading financial groups. Additionally,
the IFC has provided support for housing finance, micro, small and medium enterprise
financing, and the domestic securities market through equity investments and debt facilities.

7.    Besides the renewed focus on financial stability in response to the global
financial crisis, efforts to finalize implementation of the securities market reform
continued. This was a complex multi-stage and multi-year process, which has been
actively supported by the World Bank in all its stages. 4 The 2005 Securities Law
provided a flexible framework capable of accommodating financial innovation by
providing general principles for market operation. To implement the Securities Law, a
substantial body of regulatory decrees was issued from 2005-2009 dealing with
important aspects of securities markets under four big areas: supervision and regulation,
infrastructure, architecture and market operations. The securities market reform allowed
for the creation of standardized derivative markets and the Central Counterparty
Clearing House (CCCH), which provides the platform for the clearing and settlement of
derivatives, which began operating in September 2008.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
8.    The PDO was to support sustainable growth and alleviation of poverty. More
specifically, it focused on (i) strengthening the financial system to prevent disruptive
and costly financial crises, and (ii) consolidating the securities market as a pillar of
economic growth to address the needs of individuals and the productive sector.
9.    Program outcomes were monitored by observing the evolution of nine
medium-term indicators during the period 2009-2011. These indicators were
presented earlier in the PDO Indicators table in page 3. Their evolution over time was
monitored and reported as part of three supervision missions. A more detailed
evaluation was done during the ICR mission.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
10.      The PDO was not revised and the outcome indicators were not changed or revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
11.      The reviewed operation supported reforms in three main areas:
12. Prudential Regulation and Supervision. The operation supported key measures
undertaken by SFC to strengthen financial sector resilience. Those measures bolstered
capitalization and improved liquidity risk management and buffers.
             a. Capitalization of 2008 profits. Capitalized profits were calibrated by
                SFC through stress tests to help banks absorb potential credit losses during
                the next two years while complying with minimum capital requirements.
                At end-2010, the unused portion of the reserve could be used at the
                discretion of the institutions. This special capital reserve amounted to the
                equivalent of US$932 million (COP2.1 billion), or about 45 percent of



4
    See Box 1. A thorough review of the Bank’s contribution to the Colombian financial sector reform up to
    mid-2009 can be found in the Program Document for this DPL (paragraphs 60-61 and Annex 6).



                                                     4
                  their profits during the second half of 2008. The measure increased the
                  aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of credit institutions supervised by
                  the SFC about 70 basis points, thus elevating their CAR to 14.1 percent—
                  well above the regulatory minimum of 9 percent. This measure was
                  voluntarily adopted by all credit institutions and had an important
                  countercyclical impact as the capital buffers accumulated in 2008
                  prevented a more severe credit contraction in 2009.
             b. Comprehensive liquidity regulation. Financial institutions, except for
                insurance companies, were mandated to develop formal policies and
                procedures to deal with the liquidity risk, including the establishment of
                internal limits, remedial actions, and contingency plans. They also had to
                formulate a framework to measure such risk. To increase liquidity buffers
                and prevent reliance in short-term wholesale funding, credit institutions
                had to maintain enough liquid assets to cover liabilities potentially due
                within one week5.
13. Strengthening the Framework for the Intervention and Resolution of
Unauthorized Financial Intermediation Activities. The operation supported decrees
(Decrees 4334 and 4335 of 2008) issued under a state of social emergency to deal with
UIS, in general, and with financial pyramids, in particular. Those decrees (i) allowed
the Superintendence of Companies (―Superintendencia de Sociedades?, SS) to
administratively intervene entities if there are ―notorious and objective facts‖ that the
SS considers proof of unauthorized collection of resources from the public, and (ii)
provided the heads of local governments (Mayors and Governors) with the power to
take certain preventive measures, including closing of premises, in connection with
entities located in their jurisdictions presumed to be conducting unauthorized financial
intermediation activities. The Constitutional Court determined in early 2009 (Rulings
C-135/09, C-136/09 and C-145/09) that the decrees containing the policies supported by
this DPL were in compliance with constitutional requirements. These reforms were
essential to allow for prompt intervention of UIS to prevent that their growth and
proliferation resulted in loss of savings for their investors, especially the poor.
14. Securities Market Reform. In this area, the DPL supported the implementation
of most of the remaining key aspects of securities market reform that had started with
the enactment of the 2005 Securities Law. Supported areas included measures to
upgrade market infrastructure and enhance market architecture and operations. Such
reforms aimed at developing markets by improving market transparency, corporate


5
    The regulation mandates credit institutions to compute a liquidity risk indicator (Indicador de Riesgo de
    Líquidez, IRL) as the difference between liquid assets and liquidity requirements. Liquid assets are
    defined as cash and tradable securities (adjusted by a haircut) minus mandatory reserve requirements.
    Foreign currency and securities denominated in foreign currency have also a haircut for exchange rate
    risk. The liquidity requirements are the expected net cash-flows during the next seven days, including
    assets minus liabilities maturing within one week (both on-balance and off-balance sheet) plus a
    proportion of current account and savings deposits (based on historical observations of withdrawals).
    The IRL has to be positive.



                                                      5
governance, and professionalism among various actors operating in the capital markets.
They also aimed at reducing systemic risk, including through the use of efficient
securities settlement systems (SSS).
             a. Market Infrastructure. The operation supported (i) reforms to strengthen
                SSS by providing legal certainty to traders using exchange-traded
                securities markets of the finality of the settlement process and the
                obligation to operate on a delivery-versus-payment (DvP) basis; (ii) the
                adoption of automatic trading systems; and (iii) regulation that allowed the
                new CCCH to operate smoothly and transform it into a mature platform
                for exchange-traded derivatives.
             b. Market Architecture and Operations. The reviewed DPL supported
                decrees that (i) defined what constituted securities intermediation and
                securities operations and who and how they could participate in the
                securities market, (ii) defined who and how could operate in over-the-
                counter (OTC) markets and the types of operations that could be traded in
                such markets, requiring DvP settlement of OTC trades (e.g., foreign
                exchange forwards) and mandatory reporting of all OTC transactions to a
                trading registry regulated by SFC, with the aim of creating better
                conditions for transparency in those markets, (iii) regulated risk hedging
                via the use of derivatives based on international standards and subject
                derivatives to new accounting and valuation criteria and rules as well as
                new risk management requirements including treatment of counterparty
                risk; and (iv) improved market transparency and security by mandating
                strict separation of brokers’ proprietary investment portfolios from those
                held on behalf of their clients6.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
15.      There were no revisions to policy areas covered by this operation.

1.6 Other significant changes
16.      No changes were made to the Program

6
    In addition to improve transparency in OTC markets through the implementation of these reforms,
    prudential regulations issued by the Central Bank and SFC encourage settlement of OTC derivatives
    through the CCCH to reduce systemic risks. Such regulations eliminate capital charges for counterparty
    credit risks for OTC derivatives settled in the CCCH and exclude them from the limit on gross FX
    exposures.

Colombia (the Borrower). They were grouped into three policy areas, as shown in detail
in Box 2 below (and as stated in the Loan Agreement):

                           Box 2. Prior Actions Under the Program

1. Strengthen Prudential Regulation and Supervision
  The Borrower has initiated a program of actions aimed at strengthening its financial system,
    including, inter alia:
 1.1 The resiliency of credit institutions has been strengthened in order to manage eventual
 credit losses, through the implementation of a countercyclical policy, issued by the
 Financial Superintendence, instructing said institutions to retain a portion of their profits
 earned during the period June-December, 2008 (in a capital reserve), as evidenced by the
 Letter Nº 2009037259-000-000 issued by the Financial Superintendence on May 8, 2009
 1.2 The financial sector institutions regulated by SFC –except for insurance companies – are
 better prepared to manage liquidity risks through the implementation of internal systems
 (comprising, inter alia, policies and procedures to deal with liquidity risk; a framework to
 measure such risk and a standardized framework to compute the liquidity gap) to measure
 and administer such risks as required by the issuance of Circular Nº 16 of 2008.

2. Strengthen the Framework for the Intervention and Resolution of unauthorized
Financial Intermediation Activities
The Borrower has strengthened its ability to intervene the entities that carry out unauthorized
financial intermediation activities, through a series of actions aimed at:
  2.1 Providing SS with legal authority to take precautionary measures, including inter alia:
  taking control of said entities and their assets or ordering their freezing, and returning funds
  to the affected persons, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 4334 of 2008.
  2.2 Providing the heads of local governments (Mayors and Governors) with the legal
  mandate to take precautionary measures, including those necessary to close the premises of
  said entities located in their respective jurisdictions, as evidenced by the enactment of
  Decree Nº 4335 of 2008.

3. Securities Market Reform
The Borrower has initiated a program of actions aimed at upgrading the securities market by
reducing transaction costs and systemic risks, including, inter alia:
  3.1 The strengthening of SSS by: (i) providing legal certainty to market participants
  undertaking securities transactions; and (ii establishing criteria to determine the finality of
  said transactions, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 1456
  3.2 The regulation of automatic trading and registration systems to establish information
  technology requirements that would provide security and transparency and reduce
  operational risks, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 1120
The Borrower has initiated a program of actions aimed at enhancing the transparency of
market architecture and operations, including, inter alia:
  3.3 The establishment of policies and procedures to regulate securities intermediation and
  operations, by imposing stricter requirements aimed at: (i) improving the professionalism of
  the intermediaries; (ii) protecting investor rights; and (iii) increasing the transparency of the
  market by requiring mandatory reporting of OTC transactions to a securities trading registry
  regulated by SFC, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 1121.
  3.4 The regulation of derivatives trading, including through the issuance of accountancy

18. With one exception, the nine medium-term outcome indicators included in
the Policy Matrix achieved their targeted values by end-2011, the agreed on date
for taking stock. This was confirmed with the information gathered during the ICR
mission to Colombia that took place from January 30 to February 3, 2012. On the basis
of the most recent statistics available, the status and values of the nine Program
outcome indicators by the end of 2011 was assessed as described in Table 1.
19. The indicator that missed the target refers to the volume of standardized
derivates traded relative to the spot market. The global financial crisis and
operational problems for market operators to adapt their systems to be able to trade and
settle through the CCCH have hampered the development of the standardized
derivatives market. Nevertheless, with the improvement in the global financial
environment and as more operators connected to the CCCH, the number of traded
contracts increased by 176 percent last year. This market is expected to continue
developing swiftly in the near future as all main financial intermediaries become
operationally ready to connect to the CCCH.
20. One of the indicators is assessed as broadly observed pending a formal
assessment to be undertaken by the upcoming Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). Originally, a new assessment of the 19 CPSS-IOSCO principles for
SSS was to take place as part of an FSAP exercise prior to the closing date of this DPL.
However, the former was postponed until mid-2012. Currently, BdR, BVC/DECEVAL,
the Colombian CCCH and the Currency Clearing House are working on self-
assessments (based on the new 24 core principles) of their securities settlement systems
(they should be completed prior to the arrival of the FSAP mission). A preliminary
review of this work suggests that most if not all of the shortcomings detected during the
2005 assessment have already been resolved, particularly with the enactment of the
2005 Securities Market Law and its regulation on market infrastructure (supported by
this DPL). Some of the key shortcomings identified in the 2005 CPSS-IOSCO
assessment conducted during the 2005 FSAP update have now been resolved including:
validation of multilateral netting; the protection of the settlement systems against
bankruptcy proceedings; settlement finality; protection of collateral arrangements;
segregation of clients’ accounts from proprietary investment activities of brokers and
dealers; definition of repos and temporal securities transfers for the purpose of
repurchase agreements; absence of a CCCH and adoption of legal basis for novation
when restructuring obligations.7 Additionally, pre-settlement risk has been reduced by
confirmation of stock trades in T+0 and reduction of the whole trading cycle to T+3.
Settlement risk has been reduced by the adoption of DvP basis for all securities
transactions.

    Novation is a legal modality for extinguishing an obligation (e.g., a loan or derivative contract) for
    which there is a pre-existing formal arrangement which the consenting parties want to formally replace
    with a new obligation between such parties (e.g., as a way to carry out a debt restructuring).

  2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
  21. The implementation of this operation benefited from strong government and
  private sector commitment to preserve long-term gains in the financial system.
  Colombia has a track record of prudent economic and financial policies, which have
  steadily increased the country’s resilience to external and domestic shocks and
  improved its sovereign financial indicators and capacity to conduct counter-cyclical
  policies—all this recognized recently by an upgrade to investment grade of its
  international sovereign rating. During the last three Administrations, the GoC and the
  private sector (as reflected in the NDP) have shown a high degree of ownership over its
  priority objective of financial sector modernization, seeing it as a vehicle to promote
  domestic savings and investment, while providing simultaneously an important source
  of financing for sustained growth. In the case of this DPL, as stated in its Letter of
  Development Policy, the government was seeking support for the ongoing financial
  reform effort, in particular to strengthen the capacity of the financial system to endure
  adversity and deepen further the securities market. Since 2008, however, Colombia was
  feeling the severe effects of the global financial crisis and related strains in its fiscal
  accounts, so it was looking for alternatives to keep the pace of financial reform 8 while
  dealing simultaneously with important roadblocks, such as the collapse of pyramid
  schemes and the deterioration in the domestic credit portfolio. This operation provided a
  good vehicle to balance and lessen the pressures from a pressing short-term agenda of
  urgent needs that Colombia was facing at the time.
  22. The World Bank’s rich policy dialogue on financial sector reform with the
  Colombian authorities—spanning several Administrations now—was key for the
  successful operation implementation. In fact, the Bank has supported several stages of


  8
      In 2009, for example, Colombia furthered financial reform with the enactment of Law 1328. Among
      other things, it included the approval of legislation improving the protection and rights of consumers of
      financial services and the introduction of a multi-fund scheme for its contribution-defined mandatory
      retirement regime. In July 2010, Decree 2555 consolidated and introduced a large number of norms
      pertaining to the insurance, credit and securities industries (e.g., capital requirements and solvency
      margins of financial institutions).



                                                            11
the country’s long-term financial reform effort that started in the aftermath of the 1999
banking crisis. Strong collaboration on financial issues continues until today (presently,
with a series of knowledge service operations). In that context, the rich policy dialogue
made it easy to introduce flexibility into this operation, facilitating the incorporation of
key elements of the government’s short-term agenda while supporting its longer term
plan for the capital markets development. This certainly helped with a smooth project
implementation and the achievement of its developmental objectives. Also, such rich
dialogue facilitated the supervision of this operation and the continued discussion on
measures to further strengthen financial sector resilience and crisis preparedness9.
23. Strong implementing capacity and coordination among the public agencies
directly involved with the issues addressed in this operation was also critical for its
good implementation. Close collaboration between the SFC and SS, for example, was
critical for a smooth implementation of the policies adopted to intervene and resolve
issues raised by pyramid schemes. The capacity of private actors to respond adequately
to the challenges of the new regulation, such as in the case of implementing new
systems to manage liquidity risk or the running of a new clearing house for derivatives,
also was important for the successful implementation of the policies supported by this
DPL.
24. The fact that the Colombian economy fared much better in 2009-11 than
originally anticipated in the Program Document also helped with implementation
and meeting the objectives of this operation. The medium-term outlook in the
Program Document expected a small decline in real GDP in 2009 (of -0.7%) and a weak
recovery in the following two years. The low growth scenario, on the other hand,
projected much bleaker prospects, with a sharp GDP drop in 2009 (-4%) and tepid gains
thereafter (real GDP was projected to grow a modest 3.2% by 2013). Fortunately,
reality has been much better than all that, since real output did not decline in 2009 but
gained 1.5%, while 2010 experienced real GDP growth of 4.3%, with the latest
estimates indicating output growth of over 5% in 2011. A combination of factors,
including sound macroeconomic management and better than expected developments in
international commodity markets mitigated the effects on the Colombian economy of
the global recession. Thus, banks’ credit portfolios and other financial soundness
indicators remained resilient (see Figure 1 ahead). All this contributed to make it easier
meeting several of the key medium-term outcome indicators of this operation, having
also a positive impact on overall Program implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
25. This operation had an adequate M&E design. The nine medium-term outlook
indicators chosen to monitor progress were directly related to the policies that needed
monitoring and which had been originally put in place by the set of prior policy actions


9
    For example, in 2010 the Bank provided technical assistance to the Colombian financial authorities
    through a FIRST funded project to strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution and to further
    improve coordination among authorities and contingency planning in order to address identified areas
    for improvement in the simulation exercise referred to in Box 1.



                                                    12
supported by this DPL. By and large, tracking the chosen indicators was relatively easy
since M&E relied mainly on publicly available information and financial statistics,
which in the case of Colombia are generally accepted to be timely and of good quality.
On occasions when more detailed information was not readily available or timely, as in
the case of the data needed to evaluate progress with CPSS-IOSCO principles and other
required for preparing this ICR, the Bank was able to rely on the good capacity and
disposition of the implementing agencies and related private actors to supply the
necessary information.
26. M&E implementation for this operation was also satisfactory. There were
four supervision missions, including the ICR mission, associated with this operation.
This amount of efforts is considered to have been adequate for M&E implementation of
this otherwise rather uneventful operation. As recorded in the ISR submitted following
each supervision mission, no flags were raised during project implementation, when all
ratings of implementation performance were satisfactory. This was confirmed during
the ICR mission. In particular, M&E implementation benefitted from having the Team
Leader that worked in the design of this operation stay with the project until its closing.
This continuity plus the fluidity of the dialogue maintained with counterparts in
Colombia by the Project Team on a whole range of financial sector issues created
synergies which also benefitted the M&E implementation of this operation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
27. No next phase or follow ups to this operation are currently part of
Colombia’s lending pipeline. Although at some point some thoughts were given to the
idea of having a follow up to this DPL, currently the Bank’s engagement in the financial
sector is expected to continue with initiatives such as the FSAP exercise scheduled for
mid-2012 and technical assistance. Colombia is a major client of the Bank with a large
and diverse program in many sectors. There are many competing needs for available
lending Bank resources and limited space for new lending operations as Colombia
borrowed heavily from the World Bank in recent years in response to the global
financial crisis. However, it is important to sustain the momentum of engagements in
the financial sector trough advisory services. The drive for financial reform in Colombia
is likely to remain strong for the foreseeable future while the current CPS foresees an
important role for the Bank to play. From a more practical viewpoint, a strong advisory
services program is likely to place any return of lending operations to the sector, if the
need ever arises again, on much more solid ground.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
28. The objectives, design, and implementation of this operation were highly
relevant at the time of loan approval—and remain so today—to Colombia’s stated
development priorities as expressed in two consecutive NDP. Basically, this
operation’s objectives remain as relevant today as at the time of loan approval since
strengthening the financial system and consolidating the securities market as a pillar of


                                            13
economic growth still are very much long-term priority objectives of Colombian society.
As already explained, the objectives of this operation were aligned with those identified
by the 2006-10 NDP. In particular, they were supportive of priorities in its High
Sustainable Growth pillar. 10 Moreover, the issues addressed in this operation and its
outcomes remain relevant today and will be supportive of the objectives of the current
version of the NDP (―Prosperidad para Todos‖), which is a driving force behind the
Bank’s 2012-16 CPS. The actions taken under this DPL and the outcomes of its
implementation are providing a more solid foundation for the Colombian financial
system, and this should contribute significantly to achieving the revised financial
priorities included in the new Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity pillar of the
current 5-year NDP. Moreover, the current Roadmap of SFC which covers the period
2011-14 includes as two of its six strategic objectives the strengthening of prudential
regulations and the deepening of the capital market.11
29. At this stage of economic development, the policy actions of this operation
supportive of a deepening of the Colombian financial sector also can be expected to
help with the objective of having more inclusive growth. On the one hand,
strengthening the financial system to prevent disruptive and costly financial crises
remains as true today as at the time of loan signing. On the other, any progress in that
direction helps succeed more direct policies seeking to reduce poverty. In hindsight,
prior actions supported by this operation that strengthened prudential regulation and
supervision as well as the framework for the intervention and resolution of unauthorized
financial intermediation activities resulted in lasting improvements and contributed to a
sounder and safer financial sector (as reflected the broad improvements of financial
soundness indicators). In all this, this DPL contributed directly to a successful diffusion
of a situation of social emergency and it is still helping to better protect the savings of
the most vulnerable households.
30. As to the design of this operation, it also remains relevant today. This
financial sector DPL provides a good example of the capacity of the Bank to respond
promptly and flexibly to the needs of an important partner in development such as
Colombia, particularly at a time of severe global financial distress. Project design
changed quickly from an operation providing support for capital market reform to one
also dealing with issues more connected to economic and financial distress. This is in
part a reflection of the merits of the Bank’s multi-year programmatic approach, which
in the case of financial sector work in Colombia has meant an active engagement in a
consistent manner over time. In fact, the Bank’s lending program to Colombia expanded
faster than anticipated in recent years, and this was partly in response to additional
needs imposed by the global financial crisis. This US$300 million fast-disbursing
operation was one of the contributors to such an expansion. Meeting Colombia’s
external financing needs, in coordination with other multilaterals (IMF, IADB), allowed
the GoC to pursue its long-term objectives of enhancing financial regulation/supervision

and capital market reform while alleviating the impact of the economic crisis with the
application of countercyclical fiscal policies that favored the protection of the social
safety net.
31. The reviewed operation satisfactorily identified the main risks threatening its
expected outcome. It adequately recognized further deterioration of macroeconomic
conditions and unsustainable public debt growth as the main risks to the overall health
of the financial system and the achievement of the PDO. Fortunately, none of the
identified risks in the Program Document had a chance to materialize since overall
macroeconomic conditions ended up being considerably better than original anticipated,
as already explained.12 In particular: a) there was no regulatory forbearance, and in fact
things such as loan-loss provisioning became even more stringent in recent years; b)
preparedness at the SFC to handle complex situations such increased systemic risk or
the collapse of major credit institution has also improved (thanks in part to non-lending
support by the Bank); and c) the pace of growth of securities markets has remained
healthy, particularly now that derivatives trading finally appears to have taken off.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by
  operations and outcomes)
32. The PDO was substantially met. A variety of arguments have already been
advanced that help to substantiate the appreciation that the prior actions and
implementation outcomes of this operation indeed supported sustainable growth and the
alleviation of poverty by strengthening the financial system and consolidating the
securities market. To start with, all key outcome indicators clearly point in the direction
of significant improvement, even in the case of the indicator that measured the notional
value of derivative contracts traded vis-à-vis volume traded in the equivalent spot
markets, which clearly did not meet expectations.
33. The difficulty with meeting the derivatives market penetration indicator was
basically twofold: a) the set value of one third for this indicator now appears to have
been too optimistic, given the series of difficulties often encountered to reach maturity
in derivatives market in the best of times—these are complex financial instruments and
were brand-new in the Colombian market, which required the introduction of a new and
technically demanding trading platform (the CCCH); and b) the operational difficulties
and high initial costs encountered by the largest credit institutions to connect and start
trading in the new derivatives market was significantly underestimated. However, the
derivatives market appears to have had a turn for the better in 2011, when the volume of
traded derivative contracts had an impressive 175% gain over the volume traded in
2010. By now, CCCH has some 46 clients with an active connection to its electronic
trading platform, including basically all the major institutional investors in Colombia


12
  As to the public debt situation, according to recent IMF figures (2011 Art. IV Consultations Report)
 the baseline projection for public sector debt is currently in a downward trend in relation to GDP,
 having reached an estimated 35.9% of GDP in 2011.



                                                  15
that are expected to participate in this market. This should certainly help increase
trading in standardized derivatives in the CCCH. 13 However, a note of caution is in
order since the trading of forwards in the OTC market still is by far the preferred trading
platform among banks, where they have traditionally traded with their peers. Moreover,
and despite the benefits of the CCCH in terms of eliminating the counterparty risk,
trading in the OTC market provides flexibility and has a perceived lower transaction
cost since there are not direct fees associated with this type of trading for direct
participants in it.
34. The Colombian economy has fared well in terms of “strengthening the
financial system to prevent disruptive and costly financial crisis?. This is illustrated
for the banking system, by far the largest intermediary of financial resources in the
Colombian marketplace. IMF statistics in Figure 1 show that the soundness of the
Colombian banking system not only has been improving overtime but it also ranks well
against its peers in the region and other parts of the world. Of course, it is not possible
to claim causality for this improvement exclusively for the actions supported by this
operation, but they certainly contributed, as in the case of the special capital reserve
funded with part of the profits earned by credit institutions in the second half of 2008.
35. In the case of the “consolidation of the securities market as a pillar of
economic growth to address the needs of individuals and the productive sector? the
link with this operation’s outcomes is harder to make, although there are
indications that associated prior actions also contributed to achieving this aspect of
the PDO. First, there has been a significant increase in the volumes of shares traded in
the BVC since 2009 (57.5 % through 2011 in terms of the annual average). Statistics
from the SFC also indicate that trading of foreign exchange in the spot market declined
strongly in the last two years (a drop of some 57% for the traded annual average),
another sign that the flight to quality mentality triggered by the onset of the global
financial crisis has eroded rapidly in the last two years. In summary, these trends are
suggestive that the securities market is once again playing a more supportive role to the
private productive sector than at the time of loan approval. This is reinforced by figures
from the national accounts that show a recovery in private sector gross domestic
investment following the sharp drop experienced in 2009. In fact, this type of
investment has been slowly climbing again as a percentage of GDP (reaching an
estimated 17.2% of GDP in 2011) in the context of a GDP which is growing at a solid
pace once more (estimated at close to 5% in 2011).




13
  According to the CCCH, they are now positioned to reach notional contract value volumes of some
 20% of spot trading within the next year or so.



                                                16
17
36. Ultimately, the supported policies aimed to alleviate poverty. Growth historically
    has been a powerful force for poverty reduction in Colombia, essentially through job
    creation and real wage gains. An earlier study showed that Colombia’s poverty
    elasticity with respect to average per capita income is high (it estimated a 0.6 percent
    drop in the poverty rate for each percentage point gain in average GDP per capita).
    Thus, by helping to avert a major contraction in output, this operation was able to
    contribute to poverty alleviation. More recently, an empirical study found that ―the
    sound loan portfolio and profitability of Colombia’s banking system bode well for
    future credit and output growth, especially compared to other emerging markets and
    to Colombia’s average performance during 1998-2008.‖14 . However the drivers of
    economic growth and poverty reduction are multiple and intertwined, so no claims
    of causality can be reasonably attributed to this operation, although it is worth
    pointing out that from 2008 to 2010, poverty indicators declined from 42 percent to
    37 percent.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Satisfactory
37. This rating is based on the still highly relevant objective, design and
    implementation of this operation and on its success in adequately meeting its
    stated PDO. This was already explained in some detail in the previous two sections.
    The operation was also fully consistent with the Bank’s partnership strategy as
    expressed in the past and current CPS. It was complementary with other Bank
    activities in the sector and more generally in Colombia.15 On the other hand, there
    was measurable progress in the PDO, which was broadly met. The same can be said
    of the key medium-term outcome indicators. In addition, this operation was
    complemented by technical assistance provided by the Bank and, furthermore, this
    advisory complementary assistance is scheduled to persist for duration of the 2012-
    2016 CPS, very likely resulting in synergies that will reinforce the PDO of the
    operation being reviewed.

     Selected Issues publication, March 18, 2010.

15
      During the 2008-2011 CPS period, the Bank approved 20 loans to Colombia totaling US$3.7 billion.
     Moreover, the Bank delivered an average of six analytical and advisory activities per fiscal year, in
     topics as diverse as climate change, education quality, decentralization, financial sector access, poverty
     measurement, social protection, health system modernization and extractive industries. IFC also has
     been active in Colombia evaluating numerous private equity players to identify strong business models
     requiring financial support. It has also focused its work on capital market development (it is an equity
     holder in CCCH), as well as investment in private companies prior to their initial public offerings in the
     local equity market.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
38. This operation supported policies that sought to alleviate poverty by
    strengthening the financial system and consolidating the securities market as a
    pillar of economic growth. The impact of actions supported by this DPL on this has
    already been touched upon earlier on. Financial sector strengthen supported prompt
    credit recovery and economic growth, which in turn contributes to reduce poverty.
    Moreover, the prompt resolution of pyramids schemes and the liquidation of assets
    to repay claimants, many of them low income individuals, contributed to alleviate
    their situation. No short-term impact was envisioned in this operation on gender
    aspects.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
  development)
39. There were at least two important institutional developments related to prior
    actions supported by this operation. One was the important institutional
    strengthening of the SS in its capacity to intervene and resolve in cases involving
    unauthorized financial intermediation and investment schemes. The other was the
    introduction of regulations that made possible the launching of standardized
    derivatives and structured products via the new clearing house, CCCH.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
40. None.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
41. There was no Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshop associated with this
    operation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
42. The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is moderate.
    Certainly the outcome of this operation looked considerably riskier to achieve at the
    time of loan approval in mid-2009. Fortunately, the outlook for the Colombian
    economy and financial sector have improved strongly and beyond most expectations
    since then—at least to some extent thanks to the actions supported and the outcomes
    of this DPL. This improved economic outlook has attenuated the risks and made a
    derailment of this operation’s development outcomes less likely. To be sure, the
    global financial crisis is far from over, so it is likely that the Colombian economy
    and its financial system will be tested again. However, independently of these
    uncertain times, with its gained strength Colombia’s financial sector is likely to be
    more resilient today to external shocks than in 2009. Thus, even if some of the
    currently underlying risks were to materialize in the foreseeable future, the capacity


                                            19
     of its financial system to endure eventual challenges appears to be greater than in the
     past.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
43. The quality at entry was assured principally by the careful selection of a
    relevant list of recent prior actions with lasting impact on Colombia’s financial
    sector modernization. These actions had a high degree of ownership and were of
    high priority for the GoC. They also were fully in line with the sector work the Bank
    was carrying out and with the CPS. This set of actions represented an appropriate
    balance between the demanding needs of the moment with reforms of a more
    structural nature having important policy and institution-building impact. Moreover,
    project design was the result of a coordinated response with others contributing to
    the economic and financial plan to address the challenges posed to the country by the
    ongoing global crisis.16 On the other hand, project design was a response to an active
    process of exchanges between the Project Team, its peers at the Bank and
    management, as recorded in the minutes, notes and emails available in the project’s
    files. Finally, implementation arrangements and entry work was well coordinated
    with counterparts in Colombia, in part a reflection of years of productive country
    engagement (in this case, on themes related to the financial sector).
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
44. The monitoring and evaluation framework and actual supervisory work were
    adequate for the needs of this operation. Follow up for most outcome indicators
    was possible on line, and in the end there were no surprises during implementation.
    The ICR mission was able to get detailed information from the responsible public
    agencies and relevant private parties on all issues that needed further clarification.
    From the viewpoint of this DPL, there was policy continuity following the change of
    Administration in Colombia and a reaffirmation of the main policy objectives of this
    operation. In fact, the pace of financial reform has remained unabated and the
    collaboration and coordination between the GoC and the Bank on these issues
    remains strong, which facilitated the supervision of this operation, and the
    preparation of this ICR, in particular.


16
   The IMF for its part had just made available to Colombia a Flexible Credit Line under an arrangement
  valued at SDR3,970 million.



                                                  20
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
45. This was a well tough out financial policy operation supporting substantive
    policy objectives which were largely achieved in a reduced time framework and
    in the face of a difficult global financial environment. It focused on a relatively
    small number but key prior actions that stroke a proper balance between immediate
    needs and structural issues part of the longer term analytical agenda. Targets for
    most outcome indicators were easily met and even for the one that did not, progress
    was significant.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
46. Government ownership over the prior policy actions supported by this
    operation was essential for its success. Policy actions taken by the GoC were very
    much in the domain of the NDP and were aligned with its policy priorities. They
    were taken after intense periods of consultations with key stakeholders in the
    financial sector, and many of them went to establish the proper regulatory
    framework to existing legislation (e.g., the 2005 Securities Market Law). Several
    new financial sector reform initiatives have been undertaken following the policy
    actions supported by this operation indicating that the drive to modernize the
    financial system remains as strong today as at the time of loan approval.
 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
47. Project design as well as M&E on the part of the government was helped by the
    efficient, dedicated and knowledgeable technical support provided by
    responsible agencies. They also collaborated effectively facilitating the necessary
    M&E function of the Bank’s team. These agencies deserve a great deal of credit for
    the timely and effective way in which this operation was implemented and the
    favorable outcome in its various outcome indicators.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
48. This rating recognizes overall GoC’s ownership and initiative over the policy
    actions supported by this operation. It also recognizes readiness for
    implementation and the quality of implementation arrangement which lasted over
    two different Administrations. The enabling environment provided by the Borrower
    also facilitated the Bank work. There was a temptation to rate this performance as
    highly satisfactory, given the high quality work of those directly involved and
    responsible for the overall success of this operation. The hesitation in proposing such
    a rating, however, resides more outside the direct actions supported by this particular
    operation and more with some important pending issues in the agenda for financial
    reform. In particular, while the action taken in 2009 to increase the capital buffers of


                                            21
   credit institutions via the retention of profits was a step in the right direction, it was a
   one-time solution to the urgent need to reinforce their capital adequacy. Since
   Colombia’s financial sector has shown resilience and the economy is now
   experiencing a solid recovery, perhaps it is due time for the authorities to finally
   adopt Basle I rules for capital adequacy and clean some of the items such as
   intangibles. Moreover, Tier I capital of credit institutions does not look nearly as
   strong as if the more restrictive Basle III rules for preferential shares were adopted to
   start its implementation today. Thus, with the 2009 one-time capital reserve still
   intact in banks’ books, the opportunity exists at present for the application of a more
   stringent definition of the capital cushion of Colombian credit institutions. SFC, with
   the Ministry of Finance’s support, is reviewing the capital adequacy norm to Basel
   III rules regarding eligible capital items.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
49. A key ingredient to program success is to have government ownership,
    commitment and leadership over the agenda for reform. This is clearly a
    necessary condition although not a sufficient one for success. But without it is hard
    to get moving forward and gather the necessary political momentum and backing
    required for far reaching and broad-based reform, which often demands drastic
    changes to the legal and regulatory frameworks. It was great help for the success of
    this operation to be able to count with generous allowance of these ingredients.
50. It is important for the Bank to take into account the political economy of policy
    reform and have the flexibility to respond timely to new challenges imposed by
    changing circumstances. The underpinnings for reform in Colombia derive from
    broad-based consultations with diverse groups of civil society in search of ample
    consensus. This is particularly crucial in a country that for long periods has
    experienced political disharmony and extreme violence. The fact that this operation
    took into account the priorities of the NDP and that the CPS was very much aligned
    with it helped to keep the focus on the country’s most demanding needs. Indeed, this
    operation supported simultaneously longer term policy objectives while
    accommodating actions that helped to cope with the financial emergency of the time.
51. It is important for the Bank to have general knowledge of financial sector issues
    and conduct strong prior analytical work on the key ones. Given the
    complexities of the issues faced and the peculiarities of the Colombian reality, this
    sector knowledge appears essential for keeping the Bank’s advice focused on
    advancing Colombia’s rich agenda for modernization of the financial sector, which
    also includes the goal of achieving a more inclusive sector based on broader based
    financial intermediation. This sector work is also important to convey the Bank’s
    main objectives in a more substantial way and simultaneously persuade the
    Borrower of the value added by the Bank.
52. It is essential for the Bank to keep a rich and sustained dialogue with the
    Borrower during periods of reform. In this endeavor, there is an important role to
    play not only for lending operations but as well for keeping an active agenda of non-


                                             22
   lending activities such as focused technical assistance. This operation was shaped in
   good part by the fluid dialogue maintained with the Borrower on financial issues
   over several years now, providing a lesson on the benefits of maintaining an active
   engagement even during good times, when the Bank agenda on financial themes
   often tends to lag. Also, this continuity of effort is likely to shape and improve for
   the better the sector agenda in the years to come. The forthcoming 2012 FSAP
   update will provide advice on the program of financial sector reforms to be
   implemented over the medium term. The financial sector team of the World Bank
   will continue to provide assistance to the Colombian authorities on reform
   implementation as requested.
53. Efficient, dedicated and knowledgeable implementing agencies do matter when
    far reaching institutional and policy reform are in order. Financial reform is
    usually a complex and technically demanding endeavor, so it is not trivial if the
    Borrower does not have the capacity to finely design and implement all aspects of
    the reform effort, independently of the quality of the proposed policy changes. In the
    case of this DPL this is recognized as one of the factors the led to good performance.

 operation allowed the authorities to intervene before the growth of the schemes
 propitiated default in the payment of returns to investors. It was also indicated that
 SFC, with the support of the Ministry of Finance, is working on drafting a new capital
 regulation that complies with Basel III requirements regarding eligible capital items.
 Both comments have also been incorporated in the document.
