PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA - THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 900-ZA)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) on the Third Education
Project in Zambia, for which Loan 900-ZA was signed on June 6, 1973 for
US$33.0 million equivalent. Subsequently, the Kingdom of Norway provided
US$11.0 million on a grant basis to the Government of Zambia and the Bank
loan was reduced to US$22.0 million. The grant was administered by the
Bank. The loan and grant were completely disbursed in November 1983.
The project completion report was prepared by Bank Group Staff.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Zambia, in particular
the Project Implementation Unit staff, during the preparation of this report
is gratefully acknowledged.
Following a review of the PCR by OED staff, it was decided not to
audit the project and the PCR was sent for comment to the Borrower in
December 1984. No comments have been received.

of the Third Education Project in Zambia was approved and signed on June 6,
1973. Subsequently, the Kingdom of Norway provided US$11.0 million on a
grant basis to the Government of Zambia and the Bank loan was reduced to
US$22.0 million. The grant was administered by the Bank. Total project
costs were estimated at US$40.08 million. The project originally included
the construction of new facilities for, extensions to and/or equipment for
twelve medical training institutions, a University School of Agricultural
Sciences seven farmers training centers, three farm institutes and two
mobile training units; an educational services center; and sixty-one
secondary schools and four teacher training colleges. In addition about
115 man-years of technical assistance plus fellowships were provided
(para. 3.07).
The project has been completed after undergoing several changes
during the implementation process in 1976 and a significant modification in
1980 (para. 3.08). The Loan and grant were fully disbursed. Total project
cost amounted to US$39.5 million which is one percent below the appraisai
estimate of US$40.1 million (para. 5.01). The implementation of the
original appraised project took six years versus the expected five years
and four months. The closing date was postponed twice with the second
closing date postponed to March 1983 including a modification to the scope
of the project to allow for the utilization of undisbursed funds from
savings largely from technical assistance and civil works (para. 3.08).
The project content was amended in October 1980 and twelve
primary schools and a maintenance program for secondary schools were
included (paras. 4.27 and 4.28). From signing, the total implementation
period was slightly less than 10 years.
The experience of implementing this project points out the
importance of the following matters:
(a) although the original agreed project was completed only
eight months beyond the appraisal schedule, careful review
is needed when undertaking complex projects of this size
and the resulting difficulties encountered in supervision
and the coordination of unrelated subcomponents (para.
4.31).
(b)  the attention paid during the project implementation period
of the primary school component to budgetary implications to
ensure that adequate counterpart funds are available during
the investment period and that sufficient operating funds
are voted to make proper use of facilities (para. 6.13).



-x-
(c)  the need to reassess the Government's agricultural training
approach and rural agricultural policy during the project
implementation period in view of changing policy and country
conditions. The farmer training centers and farmer
institutes have not met with success because of policy
changes made during the implementation period and due to a
lack of operating expenditures and weak management of this
component (paras. 6.05 and 6.06).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA - THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 900-ZA)
I. SUMMARY AND RECONMEkDATIONS
Project Objectives
1.01      The principal objectives of the Third Education Project were to
improve agricultural and medical training by eliminating gaps in certain
levels of training; to assist the Borrowers's plans for rural development
by strengthening farmer training programs; to integrate and consolidate a
number of educational services responsible for education including
curriculum development, audio visual aids, library, correspondence courses
and printing; provide additional facilities to a nomber of secondary
schools and teacher training colleges being constructed under the First
Education project; to provide technical assistance for administration and
teaching in project institutions, evaluation of farmer training programs,
University planning and project management.
Project Content
1.02      The project as appraised in October 1972 consisted of the
construction of new facilities for, extensions to and/or equipment for the
following: (a) 12 medical training institutions with 750 additional
places; (b) a School of Agricultural Sciences (SAGS) (University of Zambia)
for 170 students; (c) seven farmer training centers, three farm institutes
for about 224 places and two mobile training units; (d) an Educational
Services Center; (e) 61 secondary schools including 520 boarding places and
300 staff houses; (f) four teacher training colleges with 96 additional
student places and 28 staff houses. The project also included 115
man-years of technical assistance specialists for planning, administration,
and teaching, plus fellowships. An amendment to the agreement in October
1980 provided for 12 primary schools (of which 5 were constructed due to
lack of local counterpart funds) and a maintenance program for secondary
schools.
Project Implementation
1.03      The original project became effective in August 1973, with a Bank
loan of US$33.0 million. Subsequently, the Norwegian Government entered
into a special arrangement with the Bank and the Zambian Government,
whereby Norway agreed to provide US$11.0 million as a grant to Zambia, with
the Norwegian funds to be disbursed pro rata as the Bank loan was drawn
down and administered by the Bank. The project was executed under the
direction of three Project Implementation Units, each responsible for
specific parts of the project. The Project Implementation Unit I (PIU I)
established in the Ministry of Education was responsible for the execution
of the components under secondary and teacher education; PIU II,
established at the University of Zambia (UNZA), which was in essence the



2 -
office of the university architect responsible for all UNZA campus
development, was responsible for the University School of Agricultural
Sciences (SAGS); and PIU III, a new unit established under the third
project at the Building Branch of the Ministry of Power, Transport and
Works (M-1T), was responsible for the remaining comonents.  The PIU I
carried out its functions smoothly to completion.   I PIU  II suffered from
discontinuity of service of its staff and the lack of key staff and in name
was phased out in early 1980. PIU III was, during the early stages of
implementation, assisted by PIU I. The director was in post from the
outset but without key supporting staff; the Government requested and NORA)
agreed to assist in providing key staff. Except for the first six months
when the unit was short of staff, its performance was consistently good.
The NORAD assistance apart from providing funds, recruited and maintained
competent, qualified professionals for all key posts. The implementation
of the original project took six years and a half versus the expected six
years. The closing date was postponed six months from Septenber 30, 1979
to March 31, 1980 to allow receipt of final accounts. In October 1980, the
closing date was postponed to MIarch 31, 1983 to allow the utilization of
savings largely from technical assistance and civil works. 2/
1.04      The project was amended in October 1980 and 12 primary schools
and a maintenance program for secondary schools were included. As
implemented, the final cost of the project was US$39.5 million, one percent
lower than expected, with the Bank Group financing 82X and Government 18%.
In terms of specific categories, civil works, construction materials, and
PIU expenses had cost overruns mainly due to the primary schools being 402
larger than originally planned (due to change in design) and the
implementation period being extended 30 months. The costs for the
maintenance program were originally targetted at repairing about 61
schools. The limit of the total cost of the program was restricted mainly
by the amount of counterpart funds provided by the Government and the
amount of imported building materials and components to be procured within
the 30 months. This flexibility resulted in a -cost overrun of 107%
(para. 5.02). The shortfall of 992 of the cost of technical assistance was
due to donors providing funds for these services (Annex 2). The cost of
professional services, 53% lower than estimated at appraisal was partly due
to the extensive use of existing standardized designs. The deletion of the
SAGS component meant savings in the project (para. 4.03). Additional
savings of 52% and 63% in the cost of furniture and equipment respectively
were due partly to timely procurement.
1/ PIU I was phased out between September 30, 1979 and October 2, 1980,
with some staff transferred to PIU III.
2/ The deletion of the School of Agricultural Sciences and a more rapid
start of the original components resulting in savings in price
contingencies.



-3-
Project Operating Outcome
1.05      Standardized designs were used wherever possible for all project
components. In general, the buildings are comfortable and easy to
maintain. Designs for infrastructure specifically, the provision of water,
sewerage, electricity and general site works, which were a major part of
the works at farmer training centers, farm institutes, secondary schools
and teacher training colleges were satisfactory. The objective of the
medical education component was to assist in increasing the nubers of
trained health manpower. With the exception of one secondary school and
two rural health training centers, all institutions are operational and
most are being fully utilized. New and extended facilities were provided,
the output of trained health manpower has been increased and technical
assistance requirements to assist administration and program development
were, in most cases, adequately met by che Government. The Farm Institutes
and Farmer Training Centers included in the project provided additional
student and boarding places and did not differ from the appraisal report in
either nuuier or area. However, continued lack of sufficient recurrent
funds to carry out the programs at the institutes and centers resulted in
the training institutions operating at about half capacity. The Government
assurance that it would endeavor to achieve a 50% participation rate for
women was not achieved. The Educational Services Center started on
schedule and was completed as scheduled and is operational. However, the
efficiency and capacity of the Center is handicapped by organizational and
administrative problems. The project also provided additional facilities
in term of water supply, housing, workshop facilities and hostels for 61
secondary schools and 4 teacher training colleges being financed under the
Bank's First Education Project (Loan 592-ZA). Many of the facilities were
originally intended to be financed from Government funds but the fall in
the price of copper changed the financial situation and caused the
Government to seek funds from the Bank. The difference in cost of civil
works between appraisal and the actual was due to discovering that the
buildings were in worse condition than originally anticipated and therefore
requiring additional renovation. With the exception of a study concerning
farmer training programs, the technical assistance provided under the
project was not utilized; the Government preferring to obtain it through
unilateral or bilateral assistance or by engaging local specialists.
Architectural and engineering assistance was in place from the start of
implementation and management assistance in place by early 1974, both
provided by NORAD. Specialists for the health institutions and UNZA were
in post ibout a year later than scheduled. Due to the deletion of the SAGS
and the savings under technical assistance, the loan was amended in October
1980 and twelve primary schools and a maintenance program for secondary
schools were included. Due to the lack of Government counterpart funds
only five schools were constructed, however, student places at each school
were increased due to design change and a total number of 3,080 places were
provided, about 900 more than envisaged at appraisal. The maintenance
program for the secondary schools was initiated based on a NORAD report



- 4 -
that schools included in the First Education Project, inter alios, were
falling into disrepair as the Government was short of funds to procure
maintenance materials. NORAD provided the technical assistance personnel
on a grant basis and the program progressed well and was efficiently
implemented. A total of 61 schools were to be repaired in two phases, the
first phase under the Third Education Project and the second which is
continuing under the Fifth Education Project. About 40Z of the total
target or 24 schools was reached.
1.06      With regard to the educational outcome of the project most of the
components were completed satisfactorily adding new student/boarding/
teacher facilities to existing institutions resultig In increased student
enrollment in the education system. For example, secondary school
enrollment increased by about 20% during the period 1976 to 1980.
Additional teachers have been trained through the teacher training colleges
included in the project. New primary schools have contributed to
substantially higher enrollment particularly in the urban areas. The new
Education Services Center has contributed to imp-oved:  (a) curricula for
all general and technical education levels; (b) audio visual aids.
production and distribution; (c) examination, testing and evaluation; and
(d) library services. As the Center is relatively new naturally certain
organizational and coordinating aspects of its operations need
improvement. Education in the medical and health field has been improved
through new and improved institutions although there is still a lack of
adequately trained instructors and supervisors. The secondary school
maintenance program has been very successful in improving institutions and
facilities to enhance the quality and efficiency of secondary education.
The least successful component is the agricultural education components,
where the School of Agricultural Science (SAGS) was deleted from the
project as a result of a change in higher education planning and policy (a
science laboratory facility at the UNZA was added under the Fourth
Education Project and agricultural training continued at the UNZA).
Likewise the farmers institutes and training centers are severely
underutilized because of lack of operating funds, change of policy and also
decreasing commitment on the part of the Government to this type of
training.
1.07      An overall assessment of the total project outcome is a difficult
task because of the diversified and to some extent nonrelated project
content. No doubt some project parts have been more successful than others
but a general problem which has affected mst components has been the lack
of Government capital and recurrent funds. A final conclusion would be
that the project was successful with the exception of the agricultural
education components.
Recommendations
1.08      This Third Bank financed Education Project spans a period of
twelve years from the identification stage in 1971 to a final closing in
March 1983. During the implementation of this project, another new Bank



- 5 -
financed education project was started (Credit 1251-ZA) and one (Loan
1356-ZA) completed. The size and complexity of the Third Project and the
ensuing financial constraints in the country were the major factors in the
difficulties experienced during the implementation period. More attention
could have been paid during the project period to its budgetary
implications to ensure that adequate counterpart funds were available
during the investment period and that sufficient operating funds were voted
to maka r roper use of new facilities. The original project was signed in
June 1973 and the legal agreement did not include a covenant for the
preparation of an evaluation report of the project. Several requests and
draft outlines were discussed with GOZ during supervision between 1980-83
but no report was received. It would have been useful if the 1980
amendment to the loan agreement included this requirement.
1.09      Technical assistance was not used since the Government was able
to fill the positions (in a timely manner) through grant arrangements with
other donors. However, no specific reason was ascertained for the non-use
of the overseas fellowship funds, although there still remains an acute
shortage of qualified Zambian educators in most fields. The reluctance to
use these funds indicates a need for better coordination and planning
within Government and better supervision by the Bank. In future projects
of this nature, it is recommended that: (a) emphasis be placed on the
provision of fellowships to complement technical assistance: (b) more
careful attention should be paid to studies ascertaining required numbers
and categories of staff required for any training facility to be
constructed; and (c) the funds be tied to a fixed implementation schedule
which would see those staff in place before the infrastructure is
completed.
1.10      With regard to the agricultural education component similar
constraints as discussed above were experienced. In particular, the
recurrent funds constraints seriously hampered the operation of the
agricultural institutions in terms of lower student enrollment than
expected and general shortage of funds for operating the institutions.
Also, during the implementation period the Goverment policy with regard to
agricultural training changed and placed emphasis on training on farm sites
rather than institutional training. It appears that some of these problems
could have been avoided if the Government's agricultural training approach
anc rural agricultural policy had been studied more in depth during project
preparation along with an assessment of government's commitment to this
type of training. During implementation it might have been worthwhile also
to consider modifying this component to better suit the new conditions.
Lessons Learned
1.11      The project encompassed a great variety of components under
different ministries and agencies resulting in difficulties in supervising
and coordinating project activities both on the side of the Bank and the
Government. In addition, there was a wide geographic spread of project



-6-
institutions adding to previously mentioned constraints. Government
coordination was consequently by and large lacking resulting in
non-utilization of funds for technical assistance and fellowships.
Government counterpart funds and funds to cover recurrent costs were not
sufficient and as a result certain project institutions were never
established and others seriously underutilized lacking funding for running
costs. Also the sudden change in Government planning and policy with
regard to higher education contributed to the deletion of SAGS from the
project. The project was prepared in 1971 when sector work, did not form
the major basis for project lending; consequently, this project covered a
great variety of non-related components. Obviously, chances of greater
success for this project would have increased if it had been prepared with
a view to better reach educational objectives in a more coordinated manner
and more attention paid to Government's ability to finance their share of
operating costs. During the implementation of the project there has not
been much overall coordination and follow up of the education outcome In
the numerous institutions assisted. The addition of &n educationist to the
PIU team could have had a positive impact on project results in this
respect.
1.12      The introduction of the maintenance program for secondary schools
was a positive experience whereby the GOZ gradually realized the importance
of using scarce funds for rehabilitation rather than investing in new
facilities. (This program is now continuing under the Fifth Education
Project. It might have been more productive to introduce "maintenance" of
the entire educational infrastructure, not only buildings but provision of
textbooks, supervision, management and cost reduction - until the country
shows signs of recovery.

2.01      This completion report is based on the findings of a mission by
Ms. R. Brandenburg (economist) and MIessrs. J. Segerstrom (technical
educator) and C. Hammerschmidt (architect, consultant) which was in Zambia
May 1983. The mission visited three of the five primary schools, several
farm institutes and farmer training centers and several secondary schools,
medical facilities, the Educational Services Center and various Ministries
related to the project. The mission determined how the project was executed
as compared with appraisal estimates and analyzed the impact on education
objectives and implementation of project institutions.

III. PKOJECT BACKG&OUND
Socio-Economic Setting
3.01      At the time of appraisal there were great disparities in the
degree of development between tihe industrial and traditional rural
sectors.  The increasing copper prices up to 1970 encouraged the Government
to engage in substantial aevelopment schemes including projects which
provided for increases in enrollments in all types of education.
3.02      The Government's Firsr (196b-1970) and Second (1972-Y7Wb)
National Development Plans (F1DP and SNDP) aimed at spreading the benefits
of development more evenly by (a) rapidly raising the general level ot
education and developing technical, administrative and managerial skills to
lessen aependence on expatriates; (b) increasing the productivity of
traditional agriculture in areas with sufficient potential; (c)
diversifying the economy to make it less dependent on copper; and (d)
raising the general level of social welfare. The most efficiently
implemented parts of the FNDP and the SNDP were the expansion of education
and health facilities. There has been less progress towards achieving
other goals of the First and Second National Development Plans. The Third
National Development Plan (1979-83) contains the same objectives and little
progress has been made in achieving its goals. Progress has been impedea.
by the financial and economic crisis which has diverted the attention of
policy makers from long-term objectives to dealing with day-to-day
emergencies through a series of -stop gap" measures.
3.03      During the large part of project execution (1974-1983), Zambia's
econony was in protracted economic depression. Between 1977 and 1980 real
GDP declined an average of 2.5X per annum to its lowest level since 1971.
The economic difficulties triggered a 40Z fall in the price of copper in
1975 caused a financial crisis in the balance of payments and Government
accounts. The contraction of GDP had a severe impact on Government
finances. Mineral revenue, which provided about 4UX of ordinary revenue



- 8 -
curiag the early 1970s, has been uegligible siace 1975, due to low
profitability of the mining companies. Wage increases were held below the
cost of living, and recurrent expenditure for operations and maintenance
fell in real terms. Defense expenditures and subsidies escalated during
this period and added to large recurrent deficits. In January 1976 the
Government took a series of austerity measures, including a reduction in
recurrent and capital expenditures, increases in custom duties and sales,
income taxes ana control over imports and foreign exchange transactions.
Nevertheless, zambia's terms of trade have deteriorated steadily since then
and by 1982, were 60 percent below the average for the early L9706. In
1962, copper prices reached their lowest level in real terms since the post
World War II era. The balance of payments has also been in chronic
disequilibrium since 1975, with current accounts deficits averaging b to 10.
percent of GIP during most of this period and 20 percent of GDP in
198b/82. Other external factors have also been important causes of
Zambia's present economic difficulties. For example, the Government has
little or no control on the transport difficulties in neighboring countries
on which Zambia is dependent for the movement of foreign trane.  In
addition, severe droughts required importation of food stuffs.
The Education Sector
3.U4      At Independence in 1964, Zambia was one of the african countries
least prepared in educational terms. Very few Zambians had completed
higher or secondary education or participated in skill training. As a
result, Zambia relied almost entirely upon expatriates for preparation ana
execution of development programs. It was therefore apparent that
national development could be gained only by placing major emphasis on
education which consequently received priority in the various Development
Plans during the 1964-76 period. In 1975 the Government prepared a dratt
education reform proposal which was published in 1978 and expected to be
implemented in phases starting at the beginning of the Third National
Development Plan (1979-1983). The Plan aims at modifying the existing
structure into four stages: a basic education, covering the first nine
years of school; a secona stage, covering the present three-year senior
secondary cycle; a third stage consisting of the present higher education
cycle; and continuing education, including adult literacy and
other types of non-formal education. To date, the Plan has nor been
implemented in large part due to the recurrent and capital cost
implications of the education expansion. The World Bank Group has played a
major role in expanding educatioaal facilities in Zambia, including
institution building. Five Bank Group-assisted projects have helpc.A
Zambia's primary, secondary and commercial, agricultural and technical
education. Four projects (including this Third Education, Loan 90U-ZA)
have been completed successfully.

Project Identification
3.05      A FAD/Bank mission visited Zambia in August 1971 to discuss
education policy with Government and to identify items which could be
financed in a proposed Bank project. The objectives of the proposed
project would be to assist in achieving goals of the Second Five Year
Development Plan concentrating on agricultural education and training at
all levels and on technical and health education below university level
including technical teacher training. Tne project was subsequently
prepared in June 1972 on the basis of a BankIUNESCU/FAO Identification
mission ana appraised by a bank mission in October/November 1Y7Z. The
project was negotiated April 23-27, 1973 and a loan ot US$33.0 million was
approved by the Bank's Boarci of Directors on May 31, 1973. Subsequently,
the Kingdom of Norway provided a grant of US11.0 million to the Government
(administered by the BanK) and the nank loan was reduced to USS22.0
million.
Project Objectives
3.06      The project was aesigned to assist the Government's investment
program to meet the manpower requirements of the economy in the late
197U's. It was expected to eliminate gaps in certain areas of agricultural
and medical training, strengthen tarmer training programs, bring about
economies and improve efficiency by integrating certain educational
services and proviae additional facilities for a number of secondary and
teacher training colleges.
Project Content
3.07      The project as approved inc-luded:
(a) -welve medical training institutions with an additional
enrollment capacity of 953; 102b additional boardLng places and 41 staft
housing units;
(b) a University School of Agricultural Sciences for an
additional 17U students ana 24 staff housing unitsi
(c) the expansion or Improvement of 3 farmer institutes (Fl's)
and 7 farmer training centers (FtC's) for an increased enrollment capacity
of 224 students, 3b staff housing units, and the provision of 2 mobile
training units;
(d) a new Educational Services Center (ESC), integrating nine
entities in one builaing;



- 10 -
(e) the provision of additional facilities to secondary and
teacher training colleges assisted under the First Education Project (Loan
592-ZA). Additional facilities including water supply and sewage
treatment, housing, additional workshops, classrooms and library
extensions, kitchens and dining halls, and boarding places; and
(f) technical assistance for 115 man-years for specialists to
provide essential staff for University planning, agricultural and medical
education and project implementation plus fellowships for Zambian staff.
Amendments to the Project
3.08      There were three amendments to the project:
(a) the reallocation and establishment of a new Category VI -
imported materials (June 18, 1976); This new category was created in order
to allow the Bank to make direct payment to overseas suppliers of Imported
construction materials on behalf of by the Borrower;
(b) the original Closing Date, September 30, 1979, was postponed
to March 31, 1980, to permit project accounts to be finalized; and
(c) to utilize undisbursed funds, additional items (twelve
primary schools and a maintenance program) were added in May 1980 to the
project and the Closing Date postponed to March 31, 1983.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Etfectiveness
4.01      The Loan Agreement was signed June 6, 1973 and declared effective
August 9, 1973,about one month ahead of schedule, following the
establishment of the PIU.
Project Management 3/
4.U2      The Project was executed under the direction of three project
units, each responsible for specific parts of the project. PIU I,

execution of the components under secondary and teacher education; PIU II,
at the University of ZaMbia (UNZA)5/, was responsible for the University
School of Agricultural Sciences (SAGS); and PIU IlI, a new unit established
at the Building Branch of the Ministry of Power, Transport and Works
(IMPTW), was responsible for the remaining parts of the Project.
4.03      At the start of implementation PIU b/ was ±ully equipped and
staffed and performed its duties exceedingly well to completion 7/ of the
parts for which it was responsible, whereas the PIU II experienced
difficulties with staffing, a legacy carried over from the period it was
responsible for implementation of the Second Education Project and
perpetuated auring implementation of this Project. The unit was never
fully staffed as envisaged at appraisal; key staff were secondea from other
posts in the University in acting or temporary assignments, and outside
consultants were called-in tor specitic managerial tasks. In conclusion,
the ineftectiveness of PIU II had little impact on the Project as the
Government decidea in late 1975 to split UNZA into three campuses, with the
SAGS to be placed in Solwezi. Consequently, the SAGS was deleted trom the
project d/ and PIU If thus oversaw only the design and the preparation of
bidding gad contract documents for the SAGS in Lusaka including procurement
of some equipment. As Zambia's economic conditions deteriorated the
Government aecided to postpone indefinitely construction ox UNZA's Solwezi
campus and to continue courses in agricultural sciences at Lusaka. To
date, the Solwezi campus has not been built. PIU II in name was phased out
by early 1980.
4.U4      The director of PIU III also serving as director of the Buildings
Branch of IPTW was in post from the outset, but without key supporting
staff 9/. However, the Government requested and NOMAD agreed to assist in
providing the key staff, and in February 1974 a project architect was in

post. By mid-1974 all key staft were in post, except the accountant, who
was appointed in early 1975. As the Project Ulrector was only serving
part-time, it was proposed and the Sank agreed that either the project
architect or the accountant, later named tinancial controller, serve also
as assistant director. NOUAD also provided about five supervisory building
engineers. Except tor the first six months when the unit was short of
staff, its performance was consistently good. PlU III became responsible
for the execution of the Fourth Education Project 10/ (Loan 1356-LA,
executed over the perioa 1977-63), and for aGditional components included
in the project after October 2, 1983 11/. About the same time it took
over offices and tacilities ot PIU I which was closing down.
4.05      The Project Co-ordinating Committee established July 1, 1973, was
responsible for supervising implementation of the Project as a whole. It
comprised the Permanent Secretaries for Finance (chairman), Health,
Agriculture, Education, Works, and the Vice-Chancellor of the University.
The function of the Committee was to supervise the implementation of the
project as a whole and to keep a check on the coordination of the technical
assistance and construction component. The Committee executed its
authority satistactorily during the first years of project implementation,
in particular with the three project directors and witn Bank staff during
mlssions to ZamDia. However, with Government's increasing lack of interest
its involvement and etfectiveness declined over time.
4.Ob      The NOKAD aseistance nas greatly contributed to the smooth
implementation ot the project. Apart from providing funds, NORAD recruited
and maintained competent, qualitied professionals for all key staff
including supervisory engineers in the two units. Several staff who served
in the PIU I during implementation (19b9-78) of the First Education
Project, returned and served again in PIU I and in PIU III. This continuity
of expertise in managing the Project contributed to its successful
implementation. The provision made under the loan for assistance to YIU
III was 43 man-years estimated to cost uS41.35 million including
contingencies.  It is estimated that NORAD has provided some 120 man-years
10/ To handle the additional workload resulting from the implementation of
the Fourth Education Project, NORAD trom September 1977 provided a
full time Assistant Project Director to PlU III.
II/  These items are (a) the tirst phase of a maintenance program for
secondary schools (the secomd phase is included in the Fifth Education
Project, Credit 1251-ZA) and (b) a primary school component of
initially twelve schools later reduced to five due to lack of
counterpart funds. These schools were originally part of the Lusaka
Sites ana Services Project, Loan 1057-ZA, but deleted due to a
substantial cost overrun in that project.

of assistance tor key personnel and supervisory and maintenance engineers
for tne two units from mla-1973 through March 1983, discounting the
man-years utilized for the First Education Project and the Fourth Eaucation
Project
4.07      The expertise brought to bear and developed in the units in
executing the Project has not been passed on to Zambian counterparts since
none were appointed. Supporting project units staff, and labor and
supervisors on building sites, however, have benefitted. One local staff
member of PIU lII, the Project Secretary, went on a fellowship 121 in
accounting and business administration returnea recently and ha been
appointed financial controller. It should be noted that the Project
Director of PIU III, a zambian, carried out his auties satisfactorily, ana
that a senior otficer of khE who took over as Project Director of PIU I
from July 1976 managed that part of the project competently until
completion at the end of 1979.
Physical Implementation
4.Ub      Professional Services.  Without delay, the UNZA engaged and the
Bank approved the contract for a local tirmi of architects and private local
firms of engineers and quantity surveyors as sub-consultants tor the design
and the preparation of bidding documents for the SAGS. The design and the
production of documents was successfully completed over a period of some 22
months after the Loan became ettective, a period some four months longer
than scheduled; the extra time being spent on redesigns 13/ in an effort
to stay withln the cost estimate.  The delay had no effect as such on
implementation due to the decision that the SAGS be 2ocated at Solwezi,
which consequently led to the aeletion of that component from the Project.
In lieu, an agricultural science laboratory was constructed on the Lusaka
campus, financea uncer the Second Education Project. This allowed the
continuation of the teaching of agriculture at UNZ&.
4.09      Professional services for project components other than the SAGS
were rendered by the Buildings Branch of rhe -IPTW assisted by private
firms 14/ as sub-consultants, and by locally established firms of
architects, engineers, and quantity surveyors, selected and engaged by the
12/ Financed under the Fourth Education Project.
L3/ lintially more Items were included in the architects brier than
included in the working papers, and more site works were required due
to a change in the location of the buildings.
14/ Al appraisal i- was envisaged that individual arctitects, engineers and
quantity surveyors were to be proviaed by NORAJ under the project as
technical assistance. however, this proved impractical and instead a
Norwegian tirm and PIU III architects and engineers ana a private
firm provided these services for the Building branch.



- 14 -
Government in accordance with the bank's guidelines.  The Buildings Branch
renaered about 1UX of the services 15/ compared with 20X anticipated at
appraisal and eight private firms and the National Housing Authority 16/
provided the remaining 9OX of services.
4.1U      By December 1973 a contract to a Norwegian firm for protessional
services for the secondary school component was awardea ana Dy January L974
the selection of firms of consultants were completed for al  project items
for which private consultants were required - except for the Educational
Services Center.
4.11      In October 1975, with the Bank's approval of the contracts, the
National Housing Authority ana a private firm were commissioned as
consulting architects and engineers, and quantity surveyors respectively,
for the primary school component under the Lusaka Sites and Services
Project. Professional services for the secondary school maintenance
program from the time it became part of the Project (October 2, 1980) were
rendered by engineers of PIU III, provided by NO&AD under tecnnical
assistance.
4.12      In general, the engagement and the commissioning of the
consulting firms were on schedule, they completed their respective
assignments approximately on time, and their performance was consistently
of a high professional standard including supervision of construction. The
building Brancn, in spite of a constant shortage of staff and inadequate
accomuoaarion and facilities, also performea well.
4.13      Designs.  Stancardized designs were utilized wherever possible.
besigns developea by the Buildings Branch were used for the rural health
centers ana for the facilities added to the teachier training colleges, ana
deslgns _ / developed by private consultants were usea tor the facilities

the builaings branch, are comfortable, considering local couditions and
torm pleasant environments.  Tney are easy to build ana maintain, cost is

private firm under the !irst Eaucation Project were intended to satisfy
similar requirements. A thorough account of how the designs met
the requirements is given in the Project Completion Keport of the First
Education Project. Certain unsatisfactory aspects of the original design
have been rectifiea to an extent so that for additional space to the
secondary schools under the Project, the designs were used in harmony with
the existing buildings. The designs prepared for remaining project
components by authorities and private firms of consultants satisfy the
requirements of each institution for functional ana economical buildings.
4.14      Designs for infrastructure, specifically the provision of water,
sewerage, electricity, and general site works, farmers training centers,
farm institutes, secondary schools and teacher training colleges were
satisfactory.
4.15      Civil Works. Tenders for civil works and invitation for
contractors to pre-quality were advertised internationally ana in Zambia,
and tenuering and pre-qualLficatious were carried out in accordance with
Bank guidelines.
4.1b      Construction started earlier than scheduled at appraisal, made
possible by utilizing standardized tender aocuments (and standardized
designs) developed durLng implementation of the First Education Project.
Thus by the end of 1973 tenders had been called and many contracts awarded,
representing about 3UZ of total construction works for the secondary
schools and teacher training colleges. and by mid-l174 contracts covering
some BOZ of construction for the schools and colleges were awarded, and 30JX
of the total completed.
4.17      The Educational Services Center, and works involving Ministries
of Health and Rural Development also started on schedule following
completion of designs and the preparation of tender and contract
documents. However, tor the hostels at the Ndola Health Services Training
School (MSTS), a design which was previously approved for the University
under the Second Education Project was used, and therefore Phase I at tie
HSTS, Ndola started earlier.
4.l8      In some remote locations, delays were encountered in starting
construction. Builders showea little interest in bidding for small
contracts in remote areas or in areas with military activities. Therefore,
bid returns for work in those areas were unreasonably high or no bids at
all were receivea, resulting in retenaering.
4.19      During implementation, a number ot contractors were unable to
complete the works within the construction periods stipulated in their
contracts, thus aelaying the handing over of the buildings by as much as 12
months in some cases. The delays were practically always jusrified by
reason of exceptionally inclement weather, of political disturbances, or
for reasons beyond the contractor's control e.g., securing the necessary
labor and material essential to tne carrying out of the civil works.



- 16 -
Skilled labor was in short supply in Zambia, and at times some essential
building material or components were not available due to lack of foreign
exchange. The lack of skilled workers was resolved by prolonging the
construction periods, and to alleviate the shortage of imported materials,
the Loan Agreement was amended on June 18, 1976 to include a new category
for direct importation of building materials (para. 3.G8). There were also
cases of delays because some contractors had financial difficulties. These
problems were overcome with the major contractor in question operating
under a -Scheme of Arrangement- whereby the needed financing was provided
by the Surety Company until completion, and in other cases contracts were
terminated and awarded to other contractors who completed the works.
4.20      By the end of March 31, 1978 practically all civil works (about
95%) of the original project components were completed, and the remaining
parts by the end of December 1978 i.e., by the December 31, 1978 project
completion date of the Loan Agreement). However, remedial works remained
to be done during contractual liability periods. Practical completion by
the completion date was achieved in spite of delays caused by problems
outlined hereunder, (Annex 1 pages 1, 2 and 3 set out the implementation
schedule).
4.21      Additional Facilities (Civil Works).  From October 2, 1980,
primary schools 1Y/ and a maintenance program for secondary schools were
included 20/ in the project, made possible by deletion of the SAGS and by
savings primarily under technical assistance but also from savings due to
an early implementation start.
4.22      The primary schools were originally part of the Lusaka Sites and
Services Project (Loan 1057-ZA), but due to a large cost overrun in that
project the Government requested that some of the schools 21/ be
transferred to the Third Education Project. Tenders were called for the
first three of the schools in January 1981 and the contract for all three
was awarded in April 1981. Tenders, delayed due to lack of counterpart
funds for the remaining two schools, were called in August 1981 and the
contract for the two schools awarded in November 1981. The three schools
were completed in January 1983, and the remaining two in May 1983.
19/ Initially twelve schools were envisaged, however, only five were
completed.
20/ Ref. request in letter of August 15, 1979 from Ministry of Finance and
the Loan amended October 1980.
21/ The implementation of the primary school component when part of the
sites and services of the Project was the responsibility of PIU III and
supervision was by EAPED for the Bank. Due to a lack of local
counterpart funds only five schools were built.



- 17 -
4.23      Tne maintenance program 22/ for secondary schools was based on
findings by a Government report whic& evidenced that schools, including
those built under the First Education Project, were falling into a bad
state of repair as Government was short of funds to procure repair
materials and spare parts for buildings, furniture and equipment. NORAD
agreed to provide on a grant basis the technical assistance personnel to
work with XIPTW on the program, with the view that MPTW gradually would take
over. Funds from the project were used to procure repair materials, spare
parts, arnd vehicles. The program was administered by PIU III, and tour
maintenance regional units were established, each staffed with a
maintenance engineer and supporting staft. Implementation of the program
began almost immediately after it was included in the project. Four
Norwegian supervisory engineers joined the maintenance group, and the
Program CoorcLnator tinanced by NOMAD arrived in January 1951. The program
progressed well from the starr, and a maintenance system was established
including training of staff. The target for this program was consequently
reached by the new closing date. 23/
4.24      Furniture and Equipment.  Throughout implementation of the
Project, lists of furniture and equipment were prepared by the institutions
concerned, and rorwardec to the bank for review and approval.  Tendering
and awards of contracts were timed to allow delivery directly to schools or
institutions in phase with completion of construction and £ianding over of
buildings.
4.25      In early 1975 about 1bU tirmis responaed to international and
local advertisements for pre-registerIng for the supply of rurniture and
equipment for the Project, of these about 30 foreign firms representing
some 15 countries were pre-registered along with about 53 local firms.
During the last quarter of 1976 tendering was completed for all furniture,
and by June 1977 about 50Z of all furniture was delivered, the remaining
part delivered by the end of i977.
4.26      Also by mid-1977 contracts for practically all equipment were
awarded and delivery took place during the second semester of 1977.
Contracts for priating equipment (for ESC) and some laboratory equipment
were awarded by the end of 1977 and delivered together witn small
miscellaneous items, during the first semester of 1978.
22/ A second phase of the maintenance program was included in tne Fifth
Education Project.
23/ A total of 61 schools to be repaired iLn two phases, the first phase
under the Third Education Project, the second under the Fifth Education
Project.   about 40X of true total target was reached under the Third
kaucation Proj ect.



4.27      Primary Schools.  Procurement of furniture and equipment for the
primary schoois commenced in early 1981 with delivery during second
semester 1981 to the PLU store and was subsequently installed in the
schools upon completion of construction.
4.Zb      Secondary School Maintenance Program.  The actual maintenance
program for furniture ana equipment included redesigning, repairing and
constructing school furniture using scrap material and totally demolished
furniture trom the tOE furniture store in Lusaka. Keconaitioned furaiture
was delivered to schools in the provinces and damaged furniture returned
and subsequently repaired and sent back. A simple but weJlJl equlpped
worksnop, stafted with skilled workers under the direction of an engineer
from the NuRAD team, was established for the maintenance program. The
workshop is functioning very well. Suitable equipment, such as stoves,
cookers or retrigerators, and other simple equipment have also been
rehabilitated in the workshop. The quality of furniture procured for the
Project is satisfactory and should require little maintenance.
Technical Assistance
4.29      At appraisal, technical assistance estiuated at IOZ of the total
project cost was included with bOU to be financed under the project. From
the start of implementation it was discernable that the Government was not
in favor of using Loan funds for technical assistance, preferring instead
to obtain it througn bilateral or multilateral assist.mce, or by engaging
local specialists. The Government succeeded in implementing the technical
assistance program, although in some cases it was delayed, at a minimal
cost to the project because the assistance was on a grant basis and the
cost to the Government ot local specialists was modest tAnnex 2).
4.30      Architectural ana engineering service for the Buildings sranch of
YPTW was in place from the start of implementation, and management
assistance was in place in early 1974, both provided by NOKAD. Directors
and other key specialists for the health institutions provided by WHO and
other donors and the specialist engaged for the stuoy of the use of
technical assistance at UNZA were in post about a year later than
schedulea. UNZA engaged as schenulea the academic and facilities planners
and the tarm manager - supported by donors - but the planning was
expanded to encompass the splitting up of the university into three
campuses, with the SAGS proposed to be snifted to Solwezi, thus outsiae the
scope of the Project ana in effect deleting the technical assistance trom
the project. No fellowships unuer the health component were awarded, ana
staff trainLng and fellowship programs for the SAGS were expanded by UNZA
to include also fellowships for students in other faculties studying in the
USA, UK and Canada, i.e., not within the scope of the Project, ana in
effect also aeleted from the Project.

bank Group Performance
4.31      The project was supervised by eighteen missions excluding the
completion mission. The intervals between missions were between four and
eight months with the maximum of about ten and the minimum interval of
three months. The missions averaged 2.3 weeks in the field with a minimum
of 1.4 weeks and a maximum of 3.8 weeks. Supervision of the project was
combined with Bank review of other education projects under preparation or
execution. Architects participated in 17 missions, agricultural educators
in six missions, general educators in four missions, technical educators in
eight missions, economists in eight missions, and a health educator in one
mission. Hank supervision was deficient in that the supervision of the
health component being more concernea with the physical completion than tne
educational objective*3. On the whole, however, bank Group staff
supervising the project maintained a good relationship with Government
officials which was important tor the implementation of the project ana
laid the way tor two successive projects one of which has been complete.
and closed and another which is currently being implemented. The bank and
NOBAD also took a flexible approach in dealing with the Government in that
it agreed to a major amendment to the project to allow full utilization of
the loan and grant funds. As regards the administracion ot the grant, no
known problems arose. NOBAD was kept fully informed of the status of the
project through periodic reports prepared by the PIU and sent concurrently
to the Bank and NORAD.
V. PROJECT COSTS
Capital Costs
5.01      During the implementation of the project certain items were
deleted such as the SAGS.  Technical assistance was provided for by other
donors or deleted. The corresponding savings were used to tinance
components added to the project in particular the secondary school
maintenance program and new primary schools. At completion the total
project cost was US*39.5 million, one percent less than US$40.1 million
(including contingencies) estimated at appraisal. In terms of Kwacha the
equivalent amounts are K34.39 million and K25.86 million indicating a cost
overrun of 33 percent because of devaluations of the local currency during
the implementation perioa. The cost of physical tacilities of the
various institutions as estimated at appraisal and costs at completion are
included in Annex 3, pages 2-t. The reasons tor lower costs in terms of
Kwacha of the secondary schools and the teacher training colleges, and of
the Health Services Training School (iSTC), Ndola, are a result ox an early
start of construction of the schools and colleges, and hostels at the lSTS



- 20 -
(as a first phase amounting to 60J of the total cost of the liSTS), thus
avoiding general price increases and the etfect of the lowering of the
va.Lue of the Kwacha.  The reason ror the Increase in the final costs In US
dollar terms-and a substantial increase also in terms of Kwacha--of the
four Enrolled Nurses and LLidwives Schools (ENk) is mainly due to the
construction of additional facilities24/ at Kabwe ENhS.
5.02      The final cost of the additional facilities (Annex 3, Page 1),
was 1U7Z and 91X in terms of Kwacha and US dollars respectively-over ana
above the estimate at the time the facilities were included in the
Project.  The reason tor the higher cost of the primary schools is that the
schools were 4UZ larger than originally planned, and regarding the
maintenance program, the estimatea cost of the program at the time it was
included in the Project was a cost figure targeted at repairing about half
of bl schools within 30 months i.e. betore the date ot closing the Loan.
The limit or the final cost of the program was restricted mainly by the
amount of counterpart functs the Government could proviae, and how tast
imported building material and components could reasonably be procured
within 30 months. This flexibility resulted in a 'cost overrun' of 1U7X.
however, about 30X or some USl.0 million of the materials and components
procured for the program-under Category Vl-will be used after the closing
of the project and during the second phase of the maintenance program. The
Project as implemented had a short fall of one percent in US dollar terms
(US*39.5 million) between the appraisal cost and the completion cost and in
terms of Kwacha the difference is 33Z.
Capital Cost and Financing
5.03      A detailed comparison of appraisal estimates and actual costs by
components and items is shown in the following two tables.
24/ The architects and structural engineers detailea survey showed that it
would be impractical and uneconomical to convert existing hostels to
accommodate more students, thus ttee gross area of new construction was
increased O3X.

The saving under technical assistance was because other donors partly
provided funds for these services and some were deleted. NORAD alone
granted some US$2.80 mlllion for assistance to the management of the
project over a period of almost ten years and to the Buildings Branch of
HPTW for professional services amounting to about US$0.50 million. The
final cost of professional services to the Project is 53Z lower than
estimated at appraisal, partly due to the extensive use of existing
standardized designs for project Institutions and to the assistance in
design and supervision of construction rendered, in particular, by the
architects and engineers of PIU III. Savings of 41% and 60% in the cost of
furniture and equipment respectively are due partly to the deletion of the
SAGS (savings of about US$0.14 million and US$0.32 million respectively in
furniture and equipment costs) and partly due to furniture and equipment
being procured during the earlier part of the implementation period.
5.04      Financing by the Bank of the original project was estimated at
82Z, with 18% Government financing. As completed, the Bank financed 82X or
about US$32.38 million and the Government 18% or about US$7.13 equivalent.
NORAD participated by providing a grant of 1/3 of the Bank Loan amount or
US$11.0 million equivalent administered by the Bank.
Area and Cost per Student Place
5.05      Facilities included in the project are shown in Annex 4, pages
1-4. Facilities provided are either extensions/alterations, upgrading or
rehabilitation of existing institutions with the exception of the new
primary schools. For these primary schools the gross construction area per
student place is 2.6 m2 (Annex 4, page 4) which is in line with similar
areas in other education projects financed by the Bank. The unit cost of
K229 per square meter of construction-equivalent to US$193 per square
meter at current exchange rates 25/ --corresponds to the median cost of
about US$196 26/ per square meter in Bank financed projects in Eastern
Africa. Cost per student place (Construction, Furniture and Equipment
costs) amounted to US$538 about 15% higher than the median cost 271_

Water Supply and Sewer Treatment, Electricity, Sireworic and Teaching and
Communal buildings, Boarding and Housing
5.06      The Project also includes the provision of essential services for
the FTC's and Fl's (Annex 5, page 2) and services and additional buildings,
furniture and equipment for bl secondary schnals and four teacher training
colleges 2b/.  All these facilities were pr.vided bv the Project, and
Annex 5, pages 1-2 set out what has been provided for the FTC's and FI's,
and pages 3-6 what has been provided for the schools and the Teacher
Training Colleges (1TCs).
5.u7      Facilities proviaed by the Project for the FTC's and FI's
correspona to the agreea working papers, and the variations in areas
between the appraisal assessment and what has actually been provided is
insignificant.
5,Ub      Also provisions tor the TTC's correspond to the agreea working
papers and for the secondary schools some modifications were required. The
difference between the total area ot agreed new contruction and the area
actually provided for the schools is lbX above the appraisal assessment,
and the reasons for toe increase are outlinea below.
1.U9     At the outset, the architects ana engineers in preparing surveys
of the seconaary schools for the design briefs found that some existing
buildings were in need of alterations or extensions to meet the
requiremeats of the schools, although such works were not detailed at the
time ot appraisal. It was also tound that it was necessary and economical
to replace some olaer classrooms, ablution blocks, and dormitories.
Furthermore, an increase in the number of periods of instruction in
practical subjects in some schools necessitated the provision of more
agricultural science *ooms and workshops, as well as more space in
libraries and for st;zf.
5.10      In housing, the Project provided 18 staff houses and 5U ancillary
dwellings over and above the 2bU and 13 respectively included at
appraisal. The reasons for the increase in staff houses was the decrease
in MUO's access to the Government housing pool and the need for more
accommodation of maintenance staff on the premises than was estimated
at appraisal. In numbers, the total increase in houses is about 23X. Some
of the additions may however been financed directly by the HOE.
2h/ The Government did not provide these facilities in the First Education
Project as agreed due to tinancial constraints. Consequently, they
were includea in the Third Education Project.

Disbursements
5.11      Only US$U.90 million 29/ or 3Z of the appraisal estimate was
disbursed during the first yearfRter effectiveness, due in part to
fluancing by NUKAIJ of protessional services in the buildings branch of the
MPTW for the secondary schools and the teacher training colleges, and the
general lead time for contractors progress payments to be receivea and
processed by consultants, compiled and torwarded to the bank.
Disbursements continued at a slow, steady pace until October 1980 when tney
reached US424 million based on final accounts covering the original project
less the SAGS and technical assistance. From October 1980 until completion
and closing ot the Loan the pace of disbursements increased substantially
with US49.UU million disbursed between October 1980 through November 1983
at which time the Loan was tully disbursed.
VI. PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOME
Medical Training Institutions
b.01      The objective of the Meaical Education component was to assist
the Government to increase the number of trained health manpower to stalt
the expanding health services by providing new or extended training
facilities; technical assistance to assist In administration, program
development, teaching and evaluation, and fellowship tunds for the training
of Zambians in the health field. A total of seven institutlons plus six
rural health training centers were involved.
(a) Chaiinanama Hills kealth Training Uenter
As stated in the appraisal report the three existing training
institutions were to be integrated and extended to aouble the output of
medical assistants and health assistants. uutput of trained students p.a.
approximates the output estimated at appraisal specitically; at appraisal
the estimates envisaged an output of iUU medical assistants p.a. ana 48
health assistants p.a. In 19dU, the actual output was 120 medical
assistants p.a. and 50 health assistants p.a.
(b) Health Services Training School, Ndola
This school is tully operaCtional ana the facilities are shared by
two nursing programs. At appraisal, it was envisioned the new tacilities
would provide the nucleus to train hospital staft in an integrated program,
2Y/ September 11, 1974.



embracing training of: (a) registered professional nurses, (b) registered
(professional) midwives, and (c) radiological and laboratory assistants.
however, no program was developed for (c) and they are still trained at the
Evelyn Hone College in Lusaka. Groups (a) and (b) are theoretically
prepared to work in both hospitals and rural health clinics however, the
curriculum of both groups is highly curative in emphasis and leaves doubt
about the preventive side. The nursing programs are operating to full
capacity; however there is still a shortage of tutors. In terms of output
the first year program for group (a) was estimated at appraisal to be about
50 students p.a. has aoubled and (b) the 3 year program has an output of
about IUU students p.a. instead of 54 p.a. estimated at appraisal.
Therefore, it appears that we now will be faced in the medium term with an
over supply of types (a) and (b) and a severe shortage of (c) --
radiological and laboratory assistants.
(c) Zambia Enrollea Nurses Schools
(1) Kabwe - The school principal is in place but the seven tutor
positions are vacant, ana no program has been developed.
(2) Mansa - The school was completea in 1Y78. There are 2
Intakes per year of 30 students. However, due to a shortage of tutors no
enrolled midwife program has been developed.  The present staff consists of
live trained professionals which is insufficient for the present
enrollment. Nevertheless, the program is runctioniag ana facilities are
being fully utilized.
(3)  Kasama - This school was completed in April 1978   and
accepted its first class oi 32 in July 197Y.  Reasons given by the Ministry
of health for the delay in opening were largely at' ributed to lack of
tutors.
(4) Chipata - Completed in 197u the school accepted its first
students in the enrolled nurses program in 1980. The midwife training
section ot the school has not opened since the two uneconomic nurse/midwife
schools locatea at Chitambo and 14bereshi have not yet been closed, due to
political considerations and the employment implic-.ions for local
personnel.
None of the department heads at the Chainanama Hills health
Training center were aware that about tive man years of fellowship training
were available. Personnel at the Ministry of lealth were equally lacking
in knowledge since It was apparent that no follow up took place by
Government with respect to this project item. Discuss;ons by Bank Group
supervision missions apparently naa little success in their aiscussions
with new administrative staft. It is still too early to assess the impact
the investment in health training has haa in Zambia, particularly in terms
of the quality of the medically trained manpower.



- 27 -
6.02      Witn tae exception of one  Zambia Enrollea Nurses/Zambia Enrolled
lidwives (ZEN/ZEM) school and two rural health training centers the
remaining institutions are operational and are bcing fully utilized.  For
the most part, project ob3ectives as outlined in the project report have
been met. The new ana extended facilities were provided, the output of
trained health manpower has been increased, and technical assistance
requirements to assist admintstration and program aevelopment were, in most
cases, (Annex 4) adequately met by the Government through grant agreements
with other international agencies such as SIDA, OSAS and otner agencies.
6.03      however, the existing nmnpower is still uneven.Ly distributed with
the urban areas ana hospitals receiving a disproportionately large amount
of staff.  There is increasing pressure on the various nealth project
institutions to proauce more and better trained manpower; however lacking
quali'iea trained teaching staff and acequate buagets, many institutions
are not able to operate at rull capacity nor provide students with
appropriate practical training experience.
University School of Agricultural Sciences
6.04      This project item was deletea from the project as a result of
Governments' decision to split the University campus at Lusaka into three
separate campuses one of whicn would be a new school of Agricultural
Sciences. The site of the new school would be in a rural area. The
borrower informally discussed the possibility ot holaing in abeyance funds
allocated to the project for the Agricultural Sciences facilities for
future construction of the new school.  This was not deemed a feasible
solution since: (a) the amount of funds were insufficient for a new campus;
and (b) the time required for feasibility studies aesigns and construction
would require up to five years. It was, therefore agreed to delete this
component.
Farm Institutes (FIs) Farmers Training centers (FTCs) ana Mobile Training
Units.
6.05      The project expanded and improved three FIs aud seven k'TUs
through the provision of water supply, boarding tacilitles (tor women)
additional teaching equipment and transport. It has been observed that the
facilities at both types of institutions are very adequate but are not
utilized to capaL'ty or efficiently run. Visits to five farmer training
centers and two tarmer training institutes indicated that the boarding
facilities were generally underutilized and in general the utilization
factor of the training facilities auring the year was about 35X. The major
problem was the lack of sufticient funds to operate the training centers.
Budgetary allocations aid not increase over time as the new facilities were
made available.  The operating budget for the FIs and  iCs -is reported to
be actually on a aelayed month to month basis, which makes program planning
unrealistic. Some of the institutions organized mobile courses for



- 24 -
farmers, thus elxminatlng the expenses for reslential activities but
contributing to keeplng the use factor of the institutions low. Tne
recurrent expenaitures for the training system as a whole are high since
each institution is permanently staffed with educational, administrative,
technical and ancillary staff.  The orgauizatiou.al system is somwhbat
chaotic. Although different roles were set for the two different types of
institutions (FIs ana FTGW) each one of them quite otten pertormed
institutional activities assigned to the other and coordination remains
weak. Womens' participation is stlll low due in larg- part to the course
offerings. There were however, indications that non-residential courses for
women had highest participation rate.  An evaluation study conc' rn:ng
farmer training and extension activities financed under the project
concluded that while farmer training and extension activities had some
influence in improving agricultural production, the overall impact had been
minimal, inter alia, to the inadequate training of the instructors at the
FIs and FTUS and of the agricultural extension staff members. host of the
instructors in fact had no training in teaching methods.
Unfortunately,this aspect had not been considered during proj.:ct
preparation.
6.Ob      Mobile Training Units were provided in order to reach farmers in
the North Western and Northern provinces where the scattered nature of the
population and great aistances unhibit the use of residential facilities.
Problems with spare parts and lack of operating funds rennered them
ineffective.  ftore attention by boch Government and the Bank's supervision
missions to this mode of agricultural extension may nave rendered this
project item more succesatul.
EducatLonal Services Center (ESC)
b.07      The project provided for the establishment uncer the MOE ot an
Eiucational Services Center combining facilities for the Ministry's
Correspondence Course Unit to be moved from Luanshya and its Curriculum
Development Center (CJC), Audio Visual Services Library, the Zambia Library
Service and the Instructional Resources Center of the Ministry'0 !)epartment
ot Technical Education and Vocational Training to be transferred from their
present cramped headquarters in Lusaka. It proposed to integrate these
entities in one building thus providing economies in use of space,
transport and equipment. At the time of appraisal the professional staff
totaled 44 (of whom 30X were Zambian). It was expected that by 19bl the
establishment would have about 53 staff in 1983, the professional staff
totaled 42.  However, the staff of the Correspondence Course Unit was not
included since they were still located in Luanshya. The mission observed
that the Zambia library services, part of the (ESC) which administers
regional libraries and libraries in primary and seconaary senools was faced
with the problem of transport.  The fleet of cars and trucks had been
groundea aue to lack of tunas for petrol.  Another serious problem is the
ineffectiveness of the Coorainating Committee for the kSC which was to



- 29 -
ensure cooperation among the different educational services. A Chief
Education Officer still has not been appointed. Despite the lack of
coordination however, individual units have carried out their
responsibilties.  For example, The Curriculum Development Unit 30/ has
designed, developed and tested about 80 to 90 programs and continues to
work in close association with advisory committees representing all aspects
of Zambia's industry. Since appraisal the CDU has includea an additional
five Senior Curriculum Development Specialists.
Secondary Schools and Teacher Training Colleges
6.08      The additional facilities provided unaer the project enabled
secondary schools and teacher training colleges being asslstea unaer the
Flrst Education Project to provide training in practical subjects which
resulted from curriculum revisions subsequent to appraisal of the kirst
k.ducation Project. however, latest available education statistics indicate
during the perioa 197b to l9tU enrollment in seconoary schools country-wide
has increased about 20x. As project schools constitute about halt ot the
total number in the country there are reasons to believe that improvements
carried out under the project have substantially contributed to this
increased enrollment. In addition, water supply, sewage treatment,
boarding and statf housing were provided. Discussxons witbh some
headmasters revealed that, with the provision of water and boarding
facilities, they    noticed a drop in absenteeism although no quantifiable
information was available to cosfirm this view.
Primary Schools and Maintenance Programs
6.U9      As a result of:  (a) substantial savings on technical assistance;
(b) the deletion of SAGS from the project; and (c) civil works for tue
secondary school building program completed in advance of expectea timing
and with more favorable contract prices and lower professional services
fees than estimated, the Loan Agreement was amendea (para. 3.08). Twelve
primary schools orginally includea as part of the Lusaka Squatter
Upgrading and Sites and Services Project (Loan 1U57-Z&) were transfered to
the Third Eaucation Project.  The implementation of the sites and services
project orginally  scheduled to be completed in 1979, had been delayed by
about two years due to the aeterioration of the Zambian economy, the
30/ Tne recent split of the Ministry of Education into tne Rinistry of
General kaucation and the Ministry of Higher Eaucarion mms resulted in
the transfer of the responsibilities of the Curriculum Development Unit
Unit to the Ministry of higher Education.



- 3U -
aevaluation of the kwacha and the severe restrictions placed on imports,
incluaing building materials and equipment. Out of the twelve schools
however, three were completed in November IYb3 ana two more in hay 1963.
The Goverament's promise that additional funos would be provided under the
191 budget to carry out tihe construction of the other primary schools did
not materialize and therefore tendering of the remaining seven schools did
not take place.
6.1U      All tive primary schools were commpletea by May 1983 and
classrooms, with the exception of grades 6 and 7 are filled. The schools,
four two stream schools and one three stream school were planned and
equipped for 40 students per classroom. however, about 40 to 45 students
are presently enrolled in each class. The difference in additional
student places between appraisal and the actual figures is that the
appraisal design was  furnished by the National Housing Authority uncer the
Lusaka squatter upgrading and site and services project. Subsequently,
primary schools were built to the design of the Building Branch, Ministry
of Power Transport and Works which allowed for more pupils. No staff
houses were provided unuer thie project due to the urban location of the
schools.  At appraisal it was estimated that 2,200 new student places would
be provided. The actual number of new student places was 3,Utio, a 4UX
increase.
6.11      The maintenance program for secondary schools was included as an
amendment to the project. It was initiatea in l9BU and receivea technical
assistance support from NOFAD. The engineering teams were directed to
various regions in the country and worked closely together with local hPWU
Staft. Under the project provisions were made for builaing materials,
equipment, and vehicles while GUZ contributea the recurrent funds.  The
program nas Deen quite successful and continues unaer the Fifth Education
Project. With che strong support for this program there are indications
that the WUZ is realizing the necessity to use scarce available funds for
rehabilitation and maintenance rather than for investment in new
facilities. At the end of the project period 24 schools had been
maintained and renabiliratea to allow mucni improved working conciitions to
about 11,5U0 students or about ZUZ of the secondary school enrollment.
Training ox local staff in maintenance procedures is also an important
tearure of this component.
Educational Uutcome and Conclusions
6.12      With regard to the educational outcome of the project most of the
components were completed satistactorily adding new stuaent/boarding/
teacher training tacilities to existing institutions resulting in increased
stuaent enrollment in the education system. Additional teachers have been
trained through the teacher training colleges included in the project. New
priuary schools have contributed to substantially higher enrollment
particularly in the urban areas. The new education services center has



- 31 -
contributed to improved: (a) curricula for all general and technical
education levels; (b) audio visual aids production and distribution; (c)
examination, testing and evaluation; and (d) library services. As the
Center is relatively new, naturally certain organizational and coordinating
aspects of its operations need improvement. Education in the medical and
health field has been improved through new and improved Institutions
although there is still a lack of adequately trained instructors and
supervisors. The secondary school maintenance program has been successful
in improving institutions and facilities to enhance the quality and
efficiency of secondary education. The least successful component is the
agricultural education component, where the SAGS was deleted from the
project as a result of a change in higher education planning and policy.
Likewise the farmers institutes and training centers are severely
underutilized because in part of change of policy and also decreasing
commitment on the part of the Government to this type of training.
6.13      An overall assessment of tihe total project outcome is a difficult
task because of the diversified and to some extent nonrelated project
content. No doubt some project parts have been more successful than others
but a general problem which has affected most components have been the lack
of Government capital and recurrent funds. An attempt to a final
conclusion would be that the project was successful with the exception of
the agricultural education component.
