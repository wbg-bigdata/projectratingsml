REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the equivalent of US$6.0 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance the Second Education Project.
UNDP and foreign governments are expected to finance expert services and
fellowships costing about US$1.3 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Jordan in January 1974, and its report
entitled "Current Economic Position of Jordan", (#479a-JO dated November 5,
1974,) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1974. A
country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        During 1962-66, the Jordanian economy grew at over 8 percent per
year in real terms. Price stability prevailed, and high levels of foreign
assistance sustai.ned a high level of investment and a surplus in the balance
of payments. However, Jordan's economy was adversely affected by the 1967
war with Israel and the confrontation with the Palestinian Fedayeen groups in
1970/71. The occupation of the West Bank, with 30 percent of Jordan's popula-
tion, deprived the country of about 40 percent of its GNP, and over 200,000
refugees emigrated to the East Bank. Growth of agriculture, tourism and in-
dustry, was curtailed, and the economy's dependence on external transfers
increased. The latter, together with net factor income from abroad, account-
ed for about a quarter of GNP since 1969. In 1970/71, the Government's ef-
forts to check the activity of Palestinian guerillas provoked economic sanc--
tions against Jordan by some Arab countries. Jordan was particularly affected
by the closure of the Jordanian-Syrian border from July 1971 to November 1972,
which resulted in a decrease in exports from $41 million in 1969 to $32 mil-
lion in 1971, by the suspension of budget support from Kuwait and Libya after
1970, and by the closure of the Syrian-Lebanese frontier during the first half
of 1973. Following the October 1973 war and an Arab summit conference at
Rabat a year later, more financial aid from OAPEC sources was granted to
Jordan.
4.        After a period of economic stagnation, signs of economic recovery
began to appear in the second half of 1971, with agriculture output recovering
to the level of 1967. Industry picked up in 1972, and reached almost full
capacity utilization in 1973. Exports of goods rose sharply from $32 million
in 1971, to $60 million in 1973. Economic growth is likely to have reached
8 percent in real terms in 1974, partly due to the recovery of agricultural
production from a bad crop in 1973. With the reopening of the Syrian fron-
tiers wi.th both Lebanon and Jordan in mid-1973, an improved domestic political
situation, and a revival of private investment, the economy of Jordan has



good prospects for reniewee -rowti.  A five-fold increase in phosphtate prices
sinice 1972 and an expected expansionl in phosphates production from 1 mlillion
tolIs in 1973 to J miillion tons itn 1975 inve improved balance of paynients
prospects. liicreased costs of oil requirements may be expected to be off-
sct by a correspondirg increase in royalties from oil pipelinie through-put.
iowever, since imports represent jore than 5U percent of GNP the economy
remains stronigly affected by increases of world prices.
5.        The return of internal stabilitv in 1971 permitted the Government
to devote more attention to medium- and long-term economic issues. The
planning machinery was reactivated with the establishment of the National
Planning Council (NPC), in late 1971, and of coordination committees with
the private sector. As a first step, a three year Plan (1973-75) was prepared,
which aims at achieving an 8 percent annual rate of growth in a situation of
relative price stability; creating new jobs in an attempt to reduce the 8
percent unemployment rate and the serious underemployment in the East Bank;
and improving manpower skills through vocational and technical education.
The Plan also aims at fostering a more equitable distribution of economic
gains between the various income groups and geographical regions, mainly
through rural development and improvement of housing and public services; and
at phasing out the economy's heavy dependence on foreign budget support by
reducing the budget and trade deficits through increased domestic revenues
and foreign exchange earnings.
6.        T'he Plan envisages a thorough restructuring of the economy by reducing
its lheavy reliance on services (about two-tlhirds of GDP), especially on defense
(about 22 percent of GDP in 1973), and by developing agriculture, manufacturilng
anc miring, both tnrough institutional and infrastructure support to private
initiative and througi public investment in production enterprises if needed.
ILI agriculture, whiich accounts for about 18 percent of GDP, one-third of com-
nodity exports and 30 percent of emlploymenit, emphasis is placed on developnent
of irrigation and, to a lesser extenit, on imnprovement of rainfed faming to
exploit the substantial potential for export --especially citrus and other
fruits--and for irmport substitution of wheat and meat.  Support of manufacturing
andll umining, which account for about 12 percent of GDP, 7 percent of employment
and two-thirds of commodity exports (aialf of whiclh alre phlosphates), aims at
making production more competitive and export-oriented, particularly to
neighbobring countries; developing fertilizers production based on the country's
phosphate reserves; increasing thie production of Jordan's high quality phosphate
rock; and exploiting the country's deposits of potash and copper. Four large
projects, in phosphates, potasih, fertilizer and copper production, aim at
reducing budget and trade deficits by generating substantial foreign exchange
earnings.
7.        The Plan anticipates aggregate investment of $557 million over 1973-
1975, in increase of 79 percent over tile level of the depressed 1970-1972
period.  Cxternal financing is expected to cover 42 percent of the total.
Two-tthirds of this ambitious investrnent program may be realized, in projects
detailed in the Plan.



8.        The pattern of external assistance to Jordan in the recent past has
largely been influenced by the unsettled conditions of the region. Transfers
to the Government, mostly in the form of budgetary support and military aid,
averaged $140 million-i per year during 1967-73.  Under the Khartoum Agreement,
Jordan received subsidies amounting to about $105 million annually from Kuwait,
Libya and Saudi Arabia in 19657-69. Saudi Arabia maintained financial assis-
tance ill 1970 and inzreased its aid frorm $40 million to $64 million in 1972.
Substantial US traDsfCrs ($100 million in 1972 and $89 million in 1973) com-
pensated for the susz*en2ion after 1970 of tile payments from Kuwait and Libya;
kuwait resumed its support in April 1973, raising total official transfers
received by Jordan to $179 million in that year.
9.        The new emphasis on development and an extensive project list pre-
sented in the Plan have helped to increase development aid. New commitments
over 1972-73 amourted to $137 million, mostly from Westerni sources, Kuwait and
IDA. Average terms on $92 million committed in 1973 were about 1 percent
interest, 7 yea-s of grace and 30 years maturity.    The gross inflow of long
and medium-term capital to the central and local governments, which had
averaged $10 million per year durinig 1967-70, increased to an average of more
than 430 million annually after 1970. Tiue external public debt, including
undisbursed amounts, was about $221 million at the end of 1972, of which about
10 percent wis held by the Bank Group. The outstanding and disbursed debt at
the end of 1973 was estimated at $180 million. Because of the concessional
termis, the debt service ratio was low, at 6.6 percent in 1973. Nonetheless,
because of the difficult development problems arising from the country's limnited
natural resources, serious underemployment, and the progressive reorientation
of the economy wihich is likely to follow a peace settlement and the development
of new centers of economic activity, Jordan still needs a substantial part of
external assistance on concessional terms.
PART II - LANK. GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       Jordan has to date received nine IDA cre(lits totalling $47.8 mil-
lion (net of cancellations). Four credits were made before 1967 -- two for
agricultural credit ($6.0 million) and two for water supply ($5.4 million) --
and are fully disbursed. W4ar and local disturbances adversely affected the
pace of economic development and Bank Group lending resumed in mid-1971. Cre-
dits were made for a highway project ($6 million) in 1971; an education proj-
ect ($5.4 million) in 1972, a power project ($10.2 million) in 1973, a water
supply project ($8.7 million) in 1973, and an irrigation project ($7.5 tmillion)
in 1974.  Performance under these projects is generally satisfactory.     For
FY75, a second power project, and an engineering credit to initiate the potash
project, are being prepared.   IFC has made its first investment in Jordan in
February 1974 consisting of a $224,000 equity participation and a $1,600,000
loan to Jordan Ceramic Industries Limited (JCI). IFC ihas also assisted in
the preparation of a phosphatic fertilizer project with reviews of initial
proposals and help in the establishment of a seed company. Annex II contains
a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investment as of December 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.

11.       The Government has recently requested Bank assistance in formulat-
ing, implementing and mobilizing multilateral financing for a package of dev-
elopment projects in the Rift Valley. This region includes a large portion of
Jordan's resources which are critical to the future improvements in the bal-
ance of payments and in incomes and living standards. The large mining proj-
ects in phosphate, potash and copper, the phosphatic fertilizer project, and
the related port and railway development are included in the package, as well
as further development of the water resources of the Jordan Valley and the
region south of the Dead Sea. These developments, together with the estab-
lishment of industrial zones and supporting services for light manufacturing
and tourism in other parts of the country, would contribute to reduce the
present trend of excessive concentration of economic activities in the Amman-
Zarqa area. Preparatory studies are also underway for projects in rainfed
agriculture which would expand cereal and livestock production and reduce the
countrv's dependence on agricultural imports. In view of the magnitude of
the new investments contemplated and of Jordan's reliance on external financ-
ing for the bulk of them, the Bank has requested the Government to review this
program in the framework of the current three-year Plan so as to establish
priorities in light of the financial resources likely to be available.
12.       Since 1973, the Bank has been acting as Executing Agency to a three-
year UNDP Planning Assistance Project based in the National Planning Council.
The planning team has been working with the NPC on project preparation and
appraisal, and will focus on strengthening NPC's long-term planning capabili-
ties.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
13.       Education is free and, subject to the availability of student
places, compulsory in the first nine grades. Except for a few university
courses in English, teaching at all levels is conducted in Arabic, by
Jordanian staff. The Ministry of Education has overall responsibility for
educational policies and planning for elementary, preparatory, and secondary
education. The Ministry accounts for about 70 percent of total enrollments
at these levels, the remaining pupils being enrolled either in UNRWA (United
Nations Relief and Works Agency) schools for refugees (22 percent), or in
private schools (8 percent). Repeater rates are relatively low at 8 percent
and 15 percent, with drop out rates of 3 percent and 11 percent at the
elementary and preparatory levels, respectively. The distribution of educa-
tional opportunities by sexes and between urban and rural areas is fairly
even.
14.       As a result of a consistent policy of educational expansion over
the past two decades, the formal education system in Jordan is comparatively
well developed. About 92 percent of the 6-11 year age group are enrolled in
elementary education, while enrollment ratios are 63 percent in preparatory
schools, 31 percent in secondary education, and 27 percent in higher educa-
tion - the latter being one of the highest percentages of enrollment in the
world. The University of Jordan is an autonomous public institution financed



mainly by the pr1:.-.tte .-4ector, offering courses to some 3,600 students.  In ad-
dition, some 29,000 st;.ideccs are estimated to be studying in universities
abroad.
15.       As  'La mar.y othpr countries, however, the rapid growth of the edu-
cation system has led t.  or has aggravated, structural imbalances and bottle-
necks, which adversely affnect the quality and relevance of education:
(i)  Partly due  de;.ays in increasing the capacity of teacher
training institutions as well as to high attrition and
emigration, rates, the number of qualified teachers has not
kept paca wiLh the increasing demand. At present, unqual-
ified teachers still represent 52 percent of the total
teaching force in elementary and preparatory education.
At the secondary level, 23 percent of teachers do not have
university degrees, and the largest majority of degree
holders do not have any pedagogical training. It is ex-
pected. however, that the ongoing rapid increase in enroll-
ment in teacher training institutions will progressively
reduce this imbalance, and will correct it by the mid 1980's.
(ii)  Insufficient attention has been paid to the training and
retraining needs of adult workers, both in agricultural
and non-agricultural sectors, as well as to the problem
of functional literacy; the illiteracy rate is still 41
percent of the adult population. However, a literacy
campaign has recently been approved by Government, which
aims at complete literacy of the adult population by the
mid-1980's. There are presently 205 literacy centers en-
rolling about 4,200 participants.
(iii)  The pressure of social demand has led to an over-expansion of
academically-oriented general secondary education not supported
by adequate reforms of curricula and pedagogical methods, which
has perpetuated traditional attitudes toward practical work and
thus increased the disequilibrium between employment expectations
and the availability of corresponding jobs.
(iv)  In spite of growing shortages of sub-professionals and techni-
cians, vocational and technical education have been seriously
neglected: enrollments are still too low and maladjusted to
manpower needs, insufficient efforts have been made (with a
few exceptions) to adapt curricula to the changing functional
content of occupations in Jordan, and instruction methods are
generally too theoretical.
16.       These shortcomings are recognized by the educational authorities
and steps are being taken within the framework of the Educational Plan 1970-
1980 to correct them. In addition to the continuous expansion of elementary
and secondary education, adult education and literacy programs, and teacher
training, the Education Plan aims at a better adaptation of the educational



- 6 -
system to the quantitative and qualitative manpower needs of the country and
would provide nine years of basic education to all children by the end of this
decade. This objective would be accomplished by a variety of means including:
development of curricula emphasizing scientific and technological contents;
increasing the proportion of secondary students enrolled in vocational educa-
tion (from about 8 percent to 30 percent); reorienting vocational and technical
training to strengthen industrial programs; and introducing practical subjects
into general secondary education.
17.       The supply of technicians and skilled workers in Jordan is heavily
conditioned by increasing labor shortages in the neighboring countries, parti-
cularly the Gulf States, which can offer salaries between four and five times
higher than those in Jordan. Since there are no linguistic or other barriers
against emigration, the outflow of manpower has greatly increased in recent
years, aggravating domestic shortages of skilled workers, and resulting in
rapid increases in wage rates. At present, the number of Jordanians working
abroad is estimated at 250-300,000; in 1973, their remittances amounted to
about US$46 million. Although structural changes in production processes,
emigration, the small size of the economy, and the uneven quality of avail-
able information all add to the uncertainties involved in estimating manpower
requirements, it is nevertheless clear that within the broad orders of mag-
nitude obtaining, the overall supply of university graduates and office
workers is likely to exceed the absorptive capacity of the labor market, while
severe shortages are likely to occur for technicians and skilled manual
workers.
18.       Of  the 3,560 students enrolled in vocational education in 1972/73,
about 1,600 were in commercial schools, 1,500 in industrial schools, and the
remainder in agricultural schools or in the secondary school for assistant
nurses. With the exception of the Trade Center operated by UNRWA, the exist-
ing vocational schools have been unsuccessful in meeting the needs of the
labor market, partly because of the academic orientation of curricula. Very
limited opportunities are offered for up-grading or re-training of adults
already in employment. Technical education at the post secondary level has
been limited to two engineering centers for about 200 technicians: one ope-
rated by UNRWA and the other by the Ministry of Education within the voca-
tional industrial school in Amman. UNRWA also conducts an advanced commer-
cial course for 160 refugee students. Two agricultural secondary schools con-
ducted by the Ministry of Education, with an enrollment of nearly 370 stud-
ents, provide a practically-oriented syllabus. However, fewer than 10 per-
cent of the graduates from these schools directly join the labor force as
farmers; the remainder seek government employment or further education. The
Ministry of Agriculture has little input into agricultural education, and
the Committee established between the two ministries to coordinate agricul-
tural education and review curricula has not been effective. No institution
exists for the training of personnel for the hotel and catering industry.
19.       A peculiar feature of education finance in Jordan has been the low
percentage of capital expenditure with respect to total education expenditure.
In the last five years, the Ministry of Education spent, on the average, only



- 7 -
about 7 percent of its budget for capital investments, which was too low to
provide the required nmnber of additional classrooms.    In practice, the gap
has been filled by increasing the number of rented classrooms. At present,
over 68 percent of all elementary classrooms, 50 percent of preparatory and
23 percent of secondary are rented. In urban areas these proportions are
even higher --- 95 percent, 73 percent and 89 percent respectively. Virtually
all the rented premises were formerly dwelling houses, most of the rooms are
small and very often lack adequate ventilation and natural lighting. The
Educational Plan alsc aims at a gradual improvement in the stock of these
physical facilities by replacing uneconomically small rented school buildings
and providing them with adequate workshops, science laboratories and other
teaching aids.
20.       Over the past five years, public expenditures on education have
been growing at 8.5 percent p.a., at current prices, and total domestic ex-
penditure at about 9 percent p.a. In real terms, the growth has been much
slower, probably in the neighborhood of 1.0 percent p.a. and 1.5 percent
p.a., respectively, which compares favorably with the average growth of
total enrollments of about 7 percent p.a. Central government expenditures
on education, in 1973, amounted to about JD 8.2 million (including continued
payments for teachers' salaries and rents for the West Bank), or 5.0 percent
of East Bank estimated GDP, which represents about 7.1 percent of central gov-
ernment total expenditure and about 17.9 percent of domestic public reve-
nues. Foreign aid to education was about JD 1.9 million, or 14.5 percent of
domestic expenditures on education.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
21.       In February 1972 IDA extended its first credit for an education
project in Jordan (Credit 285-JO). The project was designed to help increase
the supply of qualified primary and preparatory school teachers (including
practical subject teachers), support the policy of introducing practical
subjects into general secondary schools to transform them into comprehensive
schools, and increase the output of middle-level technicians and skilled
workers. The credit (US$5.4 million) is assisting in the financing of: (i)
a Polytechnic and Trade Training Center at Marka; (ii) two comprehensive
secondary schools in Amman; (iii) a Teacher Training Institute at Salt, and
an Agricultural Teacher Training Center in the Agricultural School at Shaubak;
and (iv) related technical assistance. After some initial delays in the pre-
paration of architectural designs, project implementation is now progressing
well, but is approximately 8 months behind the original implementation sche-
dule. The proposed second education project would reinforce the pattern of
comprehensive and technical education being financed under the first credit,
and would extend the reform to types of education not included in the first
project. The project was identified by a UNESCO mission, which visited Jordan
in mid-1973, and it was prepared and appraised by an IDA mission in May -
June, 1974.



-8-
22.       Negotiations were held in Washington on January 16, 1975.    The Gov-
ernment was represented by Dr. Hanna Odeh, President, National Planning Coun-
cil. A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project in the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan" (No. 635-JO, dated February 12, 1975) is being
distributed separately. A Credit and Project Summary is being attached as
Annex III.
Project Description
23.       The objectives of the proposed project are:    (i) to expand and re-
inforce vocational and technical education including adult training and re-
training to produce the specialized skills required for the development of
priority sectors of the economy (mining, industry, agriculture, food pro-
cessing, and tourism); (ii) to support integrated rural development projects
in the Jordan Valley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education;
and (iii) to promote quality improvements, rationalization and economy of
operation in both the compulsory cycle and secondary education by replacing
uneconomically small rented school buildings and providing the schools with
adequate workshops and other teaching facilities.
24.       The Project would include the construction, equippihg and furnish-
ing of the following facilities: (a) The Irbid Polytechnic would provide two
year postsecondary courses for about 240 students in food and textile tech-
nologies and in industrial chemistry. Training would be defined in terms
of specific fields of industrial application. (b) The Aqaba Training Complex
would provide full-time and part-time courses of various duration in five
basic specializations (plant maintenance and repair; industrial electricity;
instrumentation and control; climatization and refrigeration; materials handl-
ing and transport) as well as pre-apprentice basic training, and up-grading,
conversion and re-training courses for adults. Entrance requirements would
vary according to the courses, but would include completion of preparatory
education for full-time training; aptitude tests would be administered for
all courses. Flexible training patterns in modular form would be used to in-
crease educational efficiency. Modular training would also help improve up-
ward social mobility of workers by providing training arrangements which
could be utilized at any time over the entire span of a working life. When
fully operational and with the introduction of a continuous work day, the
Center could enroll up to 400 full-time and 230 part-time trainees, with an
estimated annual output of about 400 trained workers at different levels of
skills. (c) The Hotel Training School would consist of a hotel school with
about 280 student places and a practice hotel with a capacity of about 80
beds, and would provide two-year courses at either secondary or post-secondary
levels to train middle-level personnel for the hotel and catering industry in
four basic specializations (hotel administration, accounting and control;
reception and front office; restaurant and bar; kitchen). In addition, a
one year course in hotel management would be offered to applicants who suc-
cessfully complete any of the first three basic specializations above. (d)
The Rural Development Center would enroll up to 1,000 adult trainees per year
and organize some 50 courses per year in rural skills, general agriculture
(in cooperation with the UNDP financed training center for extension agents),
cooperative development, women's crafts, public health, nutrition and family
care as well as functionally-oriented basic literacy courses. (e) The three



comnprehensive sc.;o'.os wou.d offer a broad curriculum incorporating pre-voca-
tional training with academic subjects for all students. Each comprehensive
school would enroll approximately a total of about 2,100 students in two
shifts, 30 percent of whom would be in practical subject streams. The pro-
posed schools w3uid  l   help reduce the dependence on unsuitable rented
facilities, thus permxctitng the replacement of about 20 of the worst premises.
(f) Extensions to 16 preparatory and secondary schools (science laboratories;
pre-vocational workshops for boys; craft workshops for girls). The project
also includes a totx.l r-' 20 man/years of expert services and about 50 man/years
of fellowships. The; nhysical components of the project are to be completed
by end 197?,
25.       Durinvi negotiaLions, the government provided assurances that:  (i)
Detailed curricula and syllabi for the proposed Irbid Polytechnic and the
Aqaba Trade Trair.-ing Complex, designed in terms of the functional content of
jobs in the Jordanian industry, would be prepared and presented to the Asso-
ciation for comm2nts within two years of signing of the Credit Agreement
(Section 4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). (ii) The ongoing
preparation of a new trade testing and certification system, applicable to
all forms of vocaticnal training, would be completed by the time the proposed
Aqaba Trade Training Complex starts operating and, in any case, not later
than three ye-rs after signtng of the Credit Agreement (Section 4.05 of the
Draft Development Credit Agreement). (iii) The proposed Hotel Training
School would be legally established as a corporation within three years of
signing of the Credit Agreement (Section 4.09 of the Credit Agreement). (iv)
Within three years of signing of the Credit Agreement, the Preparatory School
Certificate Examination would be revised to: (a) allow for testing of prac-
tical skills as well as theoretical knowledge; (b) provide for testing of
educational achievement in the compulsory cycle, with criteria for satisfactory
completion to be established independently of the number of student places
available in secondary education; and (c) introduce adequate criteria to
select among the students awarded the Preparatory School Certificate those
entitled to continue to either general secondary or vocational education
(Section 4.07 of the draft Development Credit Agreement); and (v) The "tracer"
system which is to be established under the First Education Project to follow-
up on the employment pattern of graduates (Section 4.03 of the Credit Agree-
ment) would be extended to all schools included in the proposed project
(Section 4.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Project Cost
26.       The total project cost, net of duties and taxes, is estimated at
US$17.5 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$11.2 million. The
proposed $6.0 mijlion credit would finance about 54 percent of the total
estimated foreign exchange component of physical facilities and services.
Expert services and fellowships, costing about $1.3 million including contin-
gencies, are expected to be financed by UNDP and a number of foreign Govern-
ments. The Government will bear the remainder of the costs.
27.       Cost per student place range from about $4,400 for the Irbid Poly-
technic to about $1,200 for the comprehensive and hotel training schools.



- 10 -
The proposed project would have only a small impact on future educational
expenditures. At full capacity the project institutions would require about
JD 350,000 per year in operating costs, corresponding to less than 2 percent
of projected public recurrent expenditures on education by 1985.
28.       The project cost includes a contingency allowance for unforeseen
physical additions equal to 10 percent of the estimated cost of civil works,
furniture, equipment and professional services. During the project imple-
mentation period, prices are expected to increase on average by about 42 per-
cent for civil works, 37 percent for professional services, 31 percent for
furniture and equipment and 28 percent for technical assistance. Accordingly,
total price contingencies are estimated at about 38 percent of base line costs
plus physical contingencies.
Project Execution
29.       The Project Implementation Unit, established under the first project
and further reinforced, would also be responsible for the implementation of
the second project (Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
A special allowance to reduce the wide disparity of present salary scales in
the civil service and in the private sector would be paid to the personnel of
the Unit. This allowance would average around 45 percent of present salaries.
Its cost, estimated at about $150,000 over the period 1975-81, would be fi-
nanced out of the proceeds of the credit. The Ministry of Public Works would
prepare the designs and tender documents for the proposed extensions to the
existing preparatory/secondary schools and would supervise the construction
works. For the other project items, consultant architects/engineers accept-
able to the Association would be appointed under terms and conditions agree-
able to the Association.
Project Benefits
30.       The project would reinforce the pattern of educational reform pro-
moted by the first project and assist in extending the reform to new educa-
tional activities and target groups. An important benefit would be to reduce
the dependence on uneconomically small and educationally unsuited rented
facilities. In addition, the project would contribute to institution build-
ing by providing better institutional links between the schools and the labor
market, stimulating the reform of the system of examinations and trade testing,
and establishing a systematic source of information on educational buildings,
as required for educational planning and programming.
Procurement
31.       Civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that
the contracts would be awarded to Jordanian firms as the country has a compe-
titive construction industry capable of implementing the proposed project.
For the extensions to preparatory and/or secondary schools, civil works con-
tracts estimated to cost the equivalent of less than $100,000 each would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Association, provided, however, that the



aggregate cost of all such contracts shall not exceed the equivalent of
$1,100,000. The average estimated civil works costs for science laboratories,
women's craft centers and prevocational workshops are US$60,000, 63,000 and
78,000, respectively. Apart from the small sums involved, the extensions are
dispersed over the country, in some cases in remote areas. Qualified Jordanian
contractors are available in all the localities concerned.
t2.       Detailed lists of furniture and equipment would be presented for
the Association's review prior to procurement. These list would identify all
items or categories of itens costing more than US$2,000, the residual items
being included in one miscellaneous category not exceeding US$50,000 for each
institution. Items would be grouped to the extent possible to form sizeable
packages to permit bulk procurement. Furniture and equipment contracts would
be awirded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Association's guidelines. Nearly all equipment and about 80 percent
of the furniture are expected to be obtained from foreign manufacturers.
Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of custom duty applicable to competing
Imports or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever is lower. Furniture for
the preparatory/secondary school extensions would be required approximately
15 months before the completion of the comprehensive schools and would cost
not more thar, US$110,000. For this reason, contracts would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with proce-
dures satisfactory to the Association. (Schedule 3 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). The same procedure would be applied for the procurement
of the residual items included in the miscellaneous categories referred to
above. It is expected that the total value of contracts awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding would not exceed 20 percent of the total cost
of furniture and equipment.
Disbursements
33.       Disbursements for items to be financed by the proposed Credit would
be on the basis of: (i) 27 percent of total expenditure for civil works;
(if) 31 percent of total expenditure for professional services; (iii) 63 per-
cent of the c.i.f. cost or ex-factory price for furniture and equipment, and
(iv) 100 percent of total expenditure for project administration. The per-
"entage for civil works would be adjusted as necessary to distribute disburse-
ments over the implementation period.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Hashemitee Kingdom of Jordan
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately.



- 12 -
35.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special in-
terest, are referred to in paragraph 25 of this Report. Otherwise, the draft
agreement conforms to the normal pattern of Credits for education projects.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 262 Highway Project; US$6 Million Credit of June 28, 1971:
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the construction of a highway from Amman to
Zarka and the financing of a study to identify the most suitable means of dis-
tributing traffic from this new road within Amman. Completion of the road
construction works has been delayed by about two years (to about August 1975),
due partly to the closure of the Syrian border, partly to the need for some
additional works to permit the extraction of rock phosphate, and partly to
management problems of the Contractor. Construction costs have increased by
about 20 percent due to the extra works and higher prices. The Closing Date,
originally December 31, 1974, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 285 Education Project; US$5.4 Million Credit of February 11, 1972:
Closing Date: April 30, 1976
The project includes construction and equipment of two comprehen-
sive secondary schools, a polytechnic and trade training center, a teacher's
training college for preparatory and secondary schools, and extension of an
agricultural teacher training college and related technical assistance. All
contracts for civil works were awarded to local firms on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts were signed in May 1974, and con-
struction started in early June 1974. Bids for about half of the equipment
and all of the furniture were received in May 1974, and contracts have been
awarded. Cost overruns are expected to be about 35 percent for the total
project and will be met by the Government. After initial delays of about
five months, physical implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by April 30, 1976 closing date. However, an ex-
tension of the Closing Date by one year will be required for the completion
of the technical assistance program.
Cr. No. 385 Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project, US$8.7 Million Credit
of May 24, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project aims at alleviating serious water shortages and insuffi-
ciency of sewerage services in Amman, reducing the high percentage of unac-
counted for water, and developing the administrative structure of the entity
responsible for Amman's water supply and sewerage systems. The project is
progressing satisfactorily, and procurement is on schedule. Financial results
are better than appraisal projections, and progress has been made on improving

them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding

and weaknesses in project execution.

the organizational and financial systems. However, unaccounted water losses
are still high at about 50 percent, and a leak detection survey has been ini-
tiated in November 1974. A draft water tariff study has been completed.
Cr. No. 386 Power Project, US$10.2 Million Credit of May 24, 1973:
Closing Date: _March 31, 1977
The project is the first Bank Group power project in Jordan and would
help the power sector to change over from diesel to steam power generation, add-
ing 78 megawatts to present total generating capacity, and helping meet rapidly
rising demand through 1977. The project will also provide a reliable and cen-
tralized source of power. Progress in executing the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 498 Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project; US$7.5
Million Credit of July 25, 1974: Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is part of an overall development scheme for the East
Bank of the Jordan Valley, other parts of which will be financed by the German
Federal Republic, USAID and the Kuwait Fund. The project consists of the agri-
cultural development of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under irri-
gation, and the provision of rural development facilities for domestic water
supply, health, education, roads and community development for a population of
about 25,000.

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Amount:        US$6.0 million equivalent.
Terms:         Standard
Co-lenders:    UNDP and a number of foreign governments are expected to fi-
nance expert services and fellowships costing about US$1.3 mil-
lion including contingencies.
Project
Description:   The project would comprise construction, furniture and equip-
ment for the following institutions: a polytechnic at Irbid;
a training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel Training School at Amman;
three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of preparatory
and secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops, five
science laboratories, four women's craft centers); and a
rural development center. The project also includes about
20 man/years of expert services and 50 man/years of fellow-
ships.

Procurement
Arrangements:       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment for
all project institutions except the proposed extensions
and the items included in the miscellaneous category for
each institution would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. For the purpose of com-
paring foreign and local bids, local manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties
applicable to competing imports or 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price whichever is lower. Competitive bidding,
advertised locally and in accordance with local proce-
dures, would be used for the procurement of furniture
for the proposed extensions as well as for their con-
struction, where the estimated value of each construction
contract would not exceed US$100,000 and the aggregate
cost of all such contracts would not exceed the equiva-
lent of US$1,100,000. Given the wide geographical
dispersion and the small cost involved, international
competitive bidding would not be practical in these
cases. Similarly, local competitive bidding would be
used for furniture and equipment items costing less than
US$2,000, which are to be included in one miscellaneous
category not exceeding US$50,000 for each institution.
