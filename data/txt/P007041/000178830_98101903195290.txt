INTERI14 SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPIEIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AIM CONCLUSIOIIS
i.       In June, 1967, the Bank made a loan (501-EC) of US$ 4 million
to the Republic of Ecuador for a first stage Livestock Development
Project. The Government of Ecuador has requested additional funds to
assist in the financing of a Second Project in the amount of US$ 1.5
million, to supplement Loan 501-EC, as an interim operation confined to
the same project purposes and areas. There is a continuing need and
demand for long-term development credit to realize the potential for
increased productivity and for the expansion of the total area devoted
to beef cattle production. There is also a growing domestic and export
demand for beef. The basis of the Ecuadorian request for assistance
in the financing of a Second Project is to cover the forecast financial
gap of about 12 months between full commitment of the First Loan (501-EC,
estimated for June 30, 1969) and Bank consideration of a more compre-
hensive Third Livestock Project (estimated for June, 1970) which is now
being prepared.
ii.      The proposed IDA Credit wiould be used entirely for ranch
development. No additional funds for technical services would be
needed. The foreign exchange component amounts to about 22% of total
Project cost, the same as under Loan 501-EC. The proposed local
currency financing is justified on country economic grounds. The Credit
would cover 60% of the total Project cost of US$ 2.5 million. The
balance would be provided by participating financial institutions (20%)
and ranchers (20%). Based upon the average size of ranch loans, it is
expected that the development of an additional 50 to 60 beef cattle
ranches would be financed under the proposed Project. As under Loan
501-EC, investment on each ranch would be phased over a period of up
to three years.
iii.     Administrative arrangements would be the same as under the
First Loan and these would be adequate. Expected additional benefits
to participating ranchers and the economy are substantial and comparable
to those under Project 501-BC. The livestock industry can justifiably
support a Credit of US$ 1.5 million. The same term and grace period as
under Loan 501-EC (18 years including six years of grace), would be an
appropriate period for making the Credit available to participating
credit institutions for ranch development sub-loans. The Borrowrer would
be the Government of Ecuador and the Credit would be channelod through
the Central Bank to the National Development Bank and to the Ecuadorian
Development Finance Companyx, the same participants as under Loan 501-EC.



INTERIM SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELORIPT PROJECT
I. fl'DIRODCTION
1.01     The Government of Ecuador has requested additional funds to
assist in financing an Interim Second Livestock Development Project
wThich would be confined to the same project purposes and areas as the
First Livestock Development Project 1/(Loan 501-EC). This would be an
interim operation, pending completion of preparation and appraisal of
a Third, more comprehensive Livestock Development Project which would
be ready for IDA consideration about June, 1970. Loan 501-EC was a
pilot beef cattle operation for the Coastal Region, designed to yield
experience in the development of the livestock sub-sector, and also to
provide a sample census of the livestock industry to serve as the basis
for further loans.  It was to be committed over a two-year period, but
forecasts indicate full commitment in only 18 months, ending June 30,
1969, six months ahead of schedule. The Interim Credit would cover the
forecast gap of about 12 months between total commitment of Loan 501-EC
and IDA consideration of the Third Livestock Project. This appraisal
report is based on the results of a visit to Ecuador by J. Fransen in
march/April 1969.
II. JUSTIFICATIOI OF INTERIM SECOND REQUEST
2.01     The justification for an Interim IDA Credit to supplement
Project 501-BC is to avoid a halt in lending to the livestock industry
of Ecuador. A Third, more comprehensive and broader scope livestock
loan is being prepared, but because of the relative complexity of the
proposed Third Project (it will provide funds for both beef and dairy
cattle development in several regions), it cannot be completed and
presented for consideration by the IDA until about 12 months after all
funds under 501-EC would be committed. Therefore, in order to meet the
continuing basic demand for development financing, and to maintain both
the current momentum of lending and the project administration network
which has been developed, a simple, interim Second Project, which would
be a continuation of the First Project, is proposed.
2.02     There is a continuing need to invest in the beef cattle
industry of Ecuador to fulfill the objectives of the Ilational Development
Plan and to assist the Republic in its aims of agricultural diversifica-
tions Continued livestock development is a logical use of existing and
potential resources of the Coastal Region of Ecuador, especially in the
light of uncertain markets for some tropical agricultural products.
(See Annex 1 for further details of the background to the First Project,
Ecuador's beef cattle sub-sector and a description of Loan 501-EC.)
1/  See Appraisal Report Number TO-582a, dated April 24., 1967.  Loan
501-EC became effective December 4, 1967.



- 2 -
2.03      Project 501-EC has helped to finance the long-term investment
needs of ranchers ovning only about 7.5% of the total cattle population
of about 800,000 head in the Coastal Region, at a total on-ranch cost
of about U1$ 5.3 million as at March 31, 1969.  If the standard of
productivity of unfinanced ranches in the Coastal Region is to be raised
to the levels of existing loan beneficiaries, the industry would need
further long-term credit amounting to about US$ 70 million and vastly
expanded technical and marketing services.  There is a continuing strong
demand for long-term credit and an unused capacity to absorb it on
commercial lending terms.
2.04     173vidence of the past and projected future demand for the type
of credit supplied under Loan 5Ol-EC and the proposed Second Project is
shown in the following table.   The appraisal report forecast that it
would require two years to commit the initial funds available for ranch
development under the First Project.   The more rapid rate of past and
expected commitment of funds is also shown in the table belowi:

2.05     Annex 2 shows the characteristics of the movement of ranch
development funds provided by the Bank under Project 501-EfC. While
there has been a fairly constant rate of commitment of funds, the
longer term trend indicates a reduced rate both in numbers of new
loans and rate of commitment as the more advanced ranchers are served
and smaller and more marginal ranchers seek loans.
2.06     The estimated quarterly commitment rate of the Bank component
for ranch development loans would be about US$ 400,000 under the Interim
IDA Credit for continuation beyond June 30, 1969. This compares with
an average of about us$ 600,000 over the first five quarters of Loan
501-EC, This would indicate the need for a Second Project of about
US$ 1.5 million to fill the gap between June 30, 1969, when all funds
under 501-EC wrill be committed, and June 30, 1970, the target date set
for a broader based livestock project. There are no constraints to
the effective utilization of an Interim IDA Credit. There is an
adequate supply of locally bred females, continuing rancher damand, and
no shortage of local currency contributions.
III.  A1MZLYSIS OF PERFORNANCE OF LOAN 501-W
A. The Project Under Loan 501-EC
3.01     Project 501-EC was designed as a first stage project, confined
to the Coastal Region of Ecuador (see Map), and the Loan was intended to
be utilized principally in the Guayas Area concentrating on established
commercial ranchers (200) but also in the Santo Domingo/Esmeraldas Area
(40 ranchers) where diversification away from bananas was an additional
objective. (See Annex 3 for details of the development of a typical ranch
under Loan 501-Sc.) Loan. funds for long-term ranch development are
provided, 75% by Loan 501-EC and 25% by two local financial institutions,
which also provide short-term working capital. Technical services are
also supplied to participating ranchers. The Project includes a modest
tropical pasture research program and seed multiplication scheme and a
countrywide livestock survey to provide information for a later, more
comprehensive project.
B. Cormparison of Forecast with Actual Performance
3.02     At larch 31, 1969, the comparison of percentages forecast and
the actual composition of total on-ranch investments was satisfactory.
However, there was an appreciable difference in unit cost, between
forecast and actual, for pasture improvement and cattle purchase. The
difference in unit cost for pasture improvement is basically due to a
shift of emphasis from the relatively cleared but drought affected areas
of the Guayas zone, to the Santo Domingo zone which had normal rainfall
but where forest clearing, with resulting higher unit cost, is required
for pasture establishment. NIew pasture establishment in the Santo Domingo
zone currently costs about 1,500 sucres per ha compared with a forecast
of 900, and pasture renovation costs about 300 sucres per ha instead of 200.



However, once pastures are established in the Santo Domingo zone, even
at a higher unit cost, the carrying capacity is much greater than that
obtained in the main Guayas zone.  As regards livestock purchases,
current bull prices are double those forecast and cows are about 30%
higher.   However, better beef prices and physical responses should make it
possible to meet estimated returns. The overall comparison is as foliows:

C. Project Progress
3.03      From the outset, project progress has been better than
anticipated.   This has been reflected in Quarterly Progress Reports and
confirmed by the first supervision mission in March, 1968.   Project
progress at a pace well ahead of schedule was again verified by the
second supervision mission in January, 1969.
On-Ranch Development Loans
3.0       The first 15 months of Project operation have shown very good
progress.   The demand for loans has been steady and, at March 31, 1969,
115 loans aggregating approximately US$ I.0 million equivalent had been
approved by the two participating lending institutions.   Sufficient
applications are pending to commit the balance of Loan funds by June 30,
1969.   As there is a grace period of from three to five years, there has
been no repayment of principal; thus, there have beern no rollover funds for
further lending to ranchers.
Quarterly Development Loan Approval
3.05      The distribution of ranch development loans by quarters as at
March 31, 1969, is as follows:

Total            115                   35.0                 h.020
Loan size ranges from US$ 6,500 to US$ 100,000 equivalent.   The overall
average is US$ 35,000 equivalent, compared with the forecast of
approximately US$ 30,000 equivalent. (See para 3.06 for explanation of
increase in average loan size.)
Loan Approval by Project Areas
3.06      The geographic distribution of loans has been somewihat different
than planned.   It was anticipated that 200 loans would be made in the
Guayas Area and about 40 in the Santo Domingo/Esmeraldas Area.   At
March 31, 1969  70 and 45 loans had been approved respectively in the two
zones (see Map5.   The reduction in total number of loans made, compared
with forecast, is because the largest, best established ranchers in the
Guayas Area were the principal early borrowers and therefore average loan
size was large.   Severe drought in 1968/69 in the Guayas Area made it
necessary to concentrate more on the Santo Domingo/Esmeraldas Area which
was not drought affected.   This also had a net affect of increasing
average loan size because of higher costs of pasture establishment
(para 3.02).   The ranches encompass nearly all the environmental and most
of the economic conditions to be found in the Coastal Region, and though
relatively small in scope, the project is assisting in efforts to diversify
away from bananas.
Source of Financing
3.07      At March 31, 1969, the total investment cost of the 115 approved
ranch plans and loans was about U$ 5.3 million equivalent, financed
approximately as follows:
Amount             % of Total
Source         (US$'ooo,ooo)    (Forecast)        (Actual)
IBRD                          3.0           6O.x             57.0
Participating Banks            1.0           20.0             19.0
Participating Ranchers         1.3            20.0            24.0
Total Project                  5.3           100.0           100.0



- 6 -
As shown in the table, participating ranchers are providing a slightly
greater percentage of ranch development funds than forecast,
Disbursements
3.08      Total disbursements at March 31, 1969, approximated US$ 2.1
million equivalent, or about 42% of the amount allocated for ranch
development.  An additional LO% of the Loan funds have been committed,
leaving onily 18% uncommitted,   All Loan funds were committed
by June 30, 1969.  Although disbursements to meet ranch
development plans are projected over two to three year periods, it is
expected that about 70% of each ranch investment program would be
carried out in the first year of development.   Thus, a substantial
disbursement can be expected in 1969 for the 115 approved loans.
D. Organization and I*Ianagement
Channelig of Loan Funds to Participating Lending Institutions
3e09      The Borrower,under Loan 501-EC, is the Republic of Ecuador.
The Effective Date was December 4, 1967, and the Closing Date is
December 31, 1972.   The term of the Loan is 18 years, which includes
six years of grace.   The interest charge is 6.0% p.a. plus 3/8 of 1%
commitment charge.   The Central Bank acts as fiscal agent for the
Borrower in channeling Loan funds to participating credit institutions,
for which it receives 1/2 of 1% p.a. over and above the interest rate of
the IBXRDLoan for aaoqnts disbursed under the Subsidiary Loan Agreements.
This is used to cover the costs of Project Administration, including
the employment and travul of the Project Diractor
Participating Lending Institutions
3.10      The National Development Bank (BNF), a public national
development bank, and the Ecuadorian Development Finance Company (COFIEC)),
a private development finance corporation, are the two participating
lending institutions,   Participation (commitments to ranchers) by BNF
and COFIEC in the project to March 31, 1969, is summarized as follows:
No. of      % of          Amount of        % of
Institution      Loans        Total          Loans          Total
(Ius$'ot,oo) o)
BNF               104          90           3.247            81
COFIEC             11          10           0.773            19
Total             115         100           4.o20           100
This ratio of participation is close to that envisaged during the appraisal
of Loan 501-EC with the smaller ranch development plans being financed by
the B1NF and the larger ones by COFIEC.   Additional funds, averaging



- 7 -
about 24% of on-ranch investments, are provided by the ranchers;  this
is higher by 4% than the estimated participation.
Lending Terms and Conditions to Sub-Borrowers
3.11      Loan terms to ranchers are 8 to 12 years, including a gracp
period of 3 to 5 years.   Interest charge is 10% p.a. on OUtZtAiLding.,:
balances.   Sub-loans are made only after the Project Director has
approved ranch development plans.   The participating lending institu-
tions process the sub-loans according to their normal procedures.   The
proceeds of repayments from ranch development sub-loans granted under the
project, not required to service the Bank loan, are to be used for
further lending under the froject by the participating credit institutions.
Financial Operating Results of the Central Bank, BNF and COFIEC
3.12      The financial operating results relating to the project are
shown in Annex 4, Tables 1, 2 and 3 for the Central Bank, BNF and COFIEC
respectively.   Since principal payments have not matured and in mary
cases interest payments are not yet due, the data on financial operating
results are not very meaningful at this stage of the project.
Project Administration
3.13      The 4roject is coordinated by a Project Commission, the
composition of which is shoim in Annex 5.   This Commission meets
bi-monthly at Guayaquil, the location of project headquarters.
3.1h      The Project is being efficiently executed by a Project Director
appointed by the Project Commission.   He acts as Secretary to the
Commission, but has no vote.   A fully qualified and competent technical
staff of four technicians from BNF and one from COFIEC are seconded to
the project and work full-time under the direction of the Project Director,
In addition to the preparation of ranch development plans for the
approval of the Project Director, the technical staff devotes considerable
time to screening project inquiries, supervision of approved loans and to
promotional and educational aspects of the Project.   This arrangement
works well and the technical services are appreciated by the ranchers.
Current arrangements for Project Administration and technical staff
numbers are adequate for the needs of the Interim Second Project even
though increasing nuibers of smaller ranchers are expected to become
sub-loan beneficiaries.
E. IMpact of the Loan
3.15      The iioject is too new to measure financial and economic gains,
but physical progress has been good and the administration and management
are effective.   The 501-EC appraisal mission estimated that the  roject
would yield an average annual net return to the economy of Ecuador of
about 27g.   It is expected that this target -, 1 be rnt.  In addition,



- 8 -
the Project has been timely in two major respects.   Severe drought in
Manabi and Guayas Provinces caused the movement of female breeding stock
to other Provinces in the project areas where rainfall had been normal.
Some 5,o0o heifers were placed on project ranches, many of wahich wiould
have been slaughtered, had the Project not been in existence.   The other
aspect is modest assistance in diversifying the depressed banana economy.
Several ranch development plans have been approved for conversion of
banana land to pasture with commensurate strengthening of beef production
enterprises.
3.16      The 115 participating ranchers together owned about 60,000
head of cattle before the beginning of the Project.   This is approxi-
mately 7.5% of the estimated cattle population in the Coastal Region.
Projections over 10 years,the life of the sub-loans, indicate a
doubling of cattle numbers belonging to sub-borrowers and a quadrupling
of output at the end of the ten year period.   The foregoing, due to
Loan 501-EC, is forecast to result in the annual incremental production
of 16.4 thousand metric tons of liveweight beef, valued at US$ 6.0
million equivalent annually.
Tropical Pasture Research and Seed I4ultiplication Program
3.17      The tropical grassland/livestock beef cattle research program
and seed multiplication scheme is well underway at the Pichilingue
Experiment Station.   Twenty trial plots (0.5 ha each) of grasses and
legumes have been established.   Three on-ranch pasture trials are to
be initiated this year in the Guayas and Santo Domingo/Esmeraldas Areas.
Goods costing about US$ 70,000, financed under the Loan, are being
ordered.
Livestock Industry and Livestock harketing Surveys
3.18      A livestock industry survey is being conducted by the
National Planning Board.  Goods costing about US$ 36,500, financed
from the Loan for this program, have been purchased.   Census informa-
tion has been collected on about 18,000 farms throughout the country.
Tabulation of data is proceeding and should be completed by June 30,
1969.   The collection of complete information on livestock marketing
covering the three-year period preceding the livestock industry survey
has not yet been initiated, but much of the data are readily available.
IV. THE INERIM SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
4.0l      The Interim Second Livestock Development Credit to supplement
501-EC would be restricted to the same Project purposes and areas.   Its
total amount, estimated at US$ 1.5 million, would be used for ranch
development loans.   Benefits are expected to be similar to and proportional
to those estimated for the First Project,   The US$ 1.5 million would
provide 60% of ranch development financing.   The balance wiould be
provided by the two participating lending institutions (BNF and COFIEC)
(20%) and ranchers (20%).   Additional funds would not be needed for



- 9 -
technical services. The foreign exchange component iwould be about
22% of total Project cost, the same as under the First Livestock
Development Project. Since the Credit would finance 60% of estimated
total Project cost of US$ 2.5 million, substantial local cost financing
would be involved which is justified on country economic grounds.
4.02      The Credit would be made to Government on normal IDA terms.
As under Loan 501-EC, the Central Bank would act as financial agent for
the Borrower and would channel the Credit funds to participating credit
institutions. This would be done through subsidiary loan agreements
with terms similar to those under Loan 501-EC: 18 years including 6
years of grace with interest of 6% p.a. on outstanding balances plus
½ of 1% p.a. for administrative expenses of the Central Bank.  Since
the payment terms under the subsidiary loan agreements would result in
excess funds not required to service the IDA Credit, these funds would
be rechanneled through the participating banks for additional ranch
sub-loans under the Project during the 18-year term of the subsidiary
loan agreements. Thereafter, repayments from participating banks would
accrue to Government.
h.03      The disbursement percentages, procedures and the cost sharing
arrangements would be the same as under Loan 501-EC.
V. RECOPMENDATIONS
5.01      Progress under 501-EC has been better than anticipated.  All
Loan funds were committed by June 30, 1969. Credit demand by ranchers
continues to be strong. It is too early to measure the financial and
economic effects of Loan 501-EC, but from ranch inspections and
rancher responses, there is every reason to believe that the favorable
returns estimated at appraisal will be obtained. Therefore, to fill
the gap of approximately 12 months between full commitment of 501-EQ
funds (estimated June 30, 1969) and IDA consideration (estimated June,
1970) of a Third Project, an Interim Second Project of US$ 1.5 million
would be appropriate.
5.02      The assurances and covenants of Loan 501-EC would be continued
in this Interim Second Livestock Development Credit to Ecuador insofar
as they are applicable.

ECUADOR
II'TERIM SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOP1,EN' PROJECT
BACKGROUIUD TO PROJECT 501-EC
A. General
1.        Ecuador is one of the smallest countries in South America.
It is also one of the poorest in terms of income per capita, but it
possesses rich natural resources for agricultural production and is
well favored in terms of soil and rainfall.   Ecuador is predominantly
an agricultural country and approximately 65% of the present population
of 5.2 million is rural.   Agriculture, including forestry and fishing,
now contributes 34% of the Gross Domestic Product and livestock accounts
for about one-fourth of total agricultural production.
2.        There are three geographic divisions in the country:  the
Pacific Coastal Plain (Costa), the Central Mountains with associated
elevated valleys (Sierra), and the lower-lying area east of the Andes
(Oriente).
3*        The Coastal Area in which Loan 501-EC is located represents
about one-fourth of the total land area of Ecuador.   It has about 3.3
million ha suitable for agricultural purposes, 65% of which are in
production, with about one million ha in improved and natural pastures.
At least 500,000 ha of the unused portion could be utilized for
improved pastures in a beef cattle development program.   Beef produc-
tion is the major animal industry in this area and lends itself to
further expansion because of good infrastructure and proximity to
markets.   Roads in the area have been improved by a highway project
partially financed by the Bank/IDA (Loan 379EC/Credit 5lEC).
4.        The climate of the Coastal Area is tropical.   Rainfall is
higbly variable as indicated by areas of semidesert in contrast to rain
forests.   Soils in the Western part are residual and in the Eastern
part alluvial.   Due to this diversity in rainfall and soils, a wide
range of forage and cash crops can be produced.
5.        Principal commercial crops, primarily grown in the Coastal Area,
are bananas, coffee and cacao.   They account for about 80% of total
exports.   In the face of unstable world markets for these commodities,
and the ravages of Panama disease in banana production, there is a vital
need for diversification in agricultural production.   The potential
exists to diversify farm production through an expansion of the beef
cattle industry.   There is also a pressing need for an increase in beef
production to rmeet growing domestic and export demand.



AN1EX 1
Page 2
B. The Beef Cattle Sub-Sector
6.        Accurate data on livestock numbers are not available.   An
estimated cattle population of 1.9 million head is about equally
distributed between the tropical Costa and Sierra temperate zones
with only about 100,000 head in the tropical Oriente zone.   Cattle
numbers increased during the period 1953-63 at about the same rate as
the human population, i.e., 3.5% per annum.   The ratio of head of
cattle per person is very low, being only 0.4 as compared with 1.0 to
2.8 cattle per person in other South American countries.   This low ratio,
coupled with a low productivity per animal, emphasizes the need for
increasing beef production by expanding both cattle numbers and pasturage
and by increasing individual animal production efficiency.
7.        Modern beef production is still in its infancy in Ecuador.
The tropical Coastal Area is emerging, however, as the principal area of
specialized production.   Native cattle breeds (Criollo) comprise 651%
of the animal population.   Progressive ranchers follow a program of
crossing Criollo females with Zebu bulls.   Santa Gertrudis bulls have
also been used, but less extensively.   The basic problem facing the
expansion of the beef industry is a shortage of cattle of all classes,
especially females for breeding purposes.   Some ranches are primarily
engaged in breeding operations, but most ranches are being developed as
integrated breeding, growing and fattening enterprises.   Few, if any,
producers specialize in cattle fattening due mainly to the limited
availability of feeder steers which reflects the main problem of low
turnover on the extensively run breeding farms.
8.        Statistics on the distribution of cattle according to ranch
size are unavailable.   Ranch sizes in the better developed coastal
areas range from 500 to 1,500 ha devoted to cattle production.   These
ranches have an average herd size of about 500 head.
9.        The present coastal pasture lands, under current management
programs, probably will not support more than the estimated cattle
population of 800,000 head.   It is estimated, however, that the
potential exists to increase this number by about one million head.
The livestock development program included in the National Development
Plan proposes to provide eventually the grazing area required for this
number of cattle by converting the native pasture area (about 300,000 ha)
to improved pastures, by increasing carrying capacity of the already
established improved pastures (about 700,000 ha) and by establishing
about 500,000 ha of new pastures on unused lands, and on lands presently
being used for unprofitable crop production.



ANNEK 1

10.       Productive and reproductive efficiency of the present stock
is quite low.   WJeaning weights between seven to nine months of age are
usually less than 140 kg.   Average daily gain of growing-fattening
steers is low.  Most animals are marketed at three to four years of
age weighing about 400 kg.   Average rate of calves born per 100 cows
in the Coastal Area is only about 60% and calf mortality is high.   This
results in an effective calving rate (calves weaned per lO cows) of
only about h5%.   Some of the better managed ranches obtain weaning
weights of 220 kg at eight to nine months of age, and effective calving
rates close to 80%.   This indicates that the potential does exist for
increasing production efficiency.
11.       Ecuador consumes most of the beef it produces.   The estimated
output rate (animals sold off the farm per 100 head of stock) is 15.0%.
Nearly 42,000 tons of dressed beef were produced in 1963, which allowed
a per capita consumption of only 9 kg of beef.l/   In the National
Development Plan the per capita beef consumption is expected to
increase by 23% during the 10-year period, 1964-73.
12.       Exports of cattle to Peru have been legalized since 1963, but
are subject to licensing and taxes.   About 20,000 animals per year are
exported legally, but smuggling increases total exports to an estimated
50,000 head per year.   Cattle imports from Colombia, estimated at
12,000 head per year, are sometimes sold directly to Peruvian traders.
With higher production and organized markets, cattle exports to Peru
could be increased considerably.
13.       Most of the commercial farmers are aware of the opportunities
for beef cattle development.   Some of the larger farmers are importing
purebred Zebu and other breeding stock to upgrade their herds and to
sell breeding animals to other farmers.   Limited amounts of international
credit from the Export-Import Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
have been available for this purpose during recent years.   However,
long-tern credit required for intensifying pasture production is not
available.   There is a strong demand for this kind of credit.
C. Government Policies
14.       The Government realizes the importance of the livestock sub-
sector for the development of the country.   The National Development
Plan aims at an increase in cattle population from 1.9 million to 2.7
million head over the period 1964-73.  This would be achieved by an
annual growth rate of 3.6% over the 5-year period 1964-68 and of 3.9%
over the ensuing 5-year period, 1969-73.   Beef production is expected to
increase from nearly h2,000 t carcass weight in 1963 to about 54,000 t
in 1968 and to about 77,000 t in 1973.
1/ Per capita beef consumption in South America ranges from 6 kg (Bolivia)
to 73 kg (Argentina).

15.       Agriculture and livestock will account for 6.9% of all
investments made in the public sector over the 10-year period, 1964-73
of the National Development Plan.   Under the Plan  it is expected that
of the investments in the private sector,23% will be allocated to
agriculture and livestock.
16.       In connection with its livestock development program, the
Government plans an improvement of the animal health services, the
installation of two centers for artificial insemination (Coastal Area),
the establishment of two training and demonstration centers (Costa and
Sierra) and a strengthening of agricultural extension services.   Animal
health services are adequate in the project aroa and extension services
will be established as part of the Project.
D. General Description of Project 501-EC
17.       Project 501-EC is the first stage of a long-term  livestock
development program which forms part of the National Development Plan.
It provided on-ranch investments totaling about 115 million sucres
(US$6.4 million) in the beef cattle industry and supporting services
totaling about 7 million sucres (Us$0.4 million).   Because there is
little experience in Ecuador of financing this type of development, a
phased approach was used, confining the Project to two specific coastal
areas, Guayas and Santo Domingo/Esmeraldas.  These areas were selected
principally for their accessibility to developing markets, land potential,
and the necessity for adequate technical appraisal and supervision.
18.       The project is directed mainly at improvement of existing
ranches to raise both pasture land and herd productivity.   In addition,
it is planned to finance the establishment of improved pastures on new
land on most participating ranches.   This new land is either in a
natural forest state or in bananas abandoned because of Panama disease.
Local procurement and import of male and female breeding cattle wzould
also be financed under the project.   Long-term development credit for
8 to 12 years would be made available to participating ranchers.
On-ranch investments would be spread over three years.
