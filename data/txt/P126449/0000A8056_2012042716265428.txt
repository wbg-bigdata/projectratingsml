                         To support the GoP in the implementation of its efforts to achieve higher rates of green, inclusive growth. In particular, it supports the government’s strategy to develop
                         policy reforms and programs which:
                          i. promote statewide rural green inclusive growth by: (a) improving land tenure security, (b) promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and (c) ensuring environmental
                         sustainability;
                          ii. promote inclusive growth through improved statewide public education and a strengthened role for youth in the labor market; and
                          iii. promote fiscal sustainability through a strengthened institutional framework for efficient public service delivery through the creation and implementation of a results-
                         based management tool within the public sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The identification, preparation, and appraisal stages were completed successfully. During all those stages, the Bank and GoP carried out several missions and virtual meetings to
                         discuss the development priorities of the State, focusing on the following areas: sustainable and inclusive rural development, environment, land regularization, education, and public
                         sector management. More specifically, the main development goal was to support state policies and programs that: (i) promote green growth in rural areas, (ii) improve access and
                         quality of education, and (iii) strengthen the institutional framework for efficient public service delivery through the creation and implementation of a results-based management tool
                         within the public sector. The DPL also pays special attention to the targeting of such policies and programs to support and promote women, youth and quilombolas groups.

                         The following policies are supported under the DPL:
                         -        State Law No. 6,127 of November 21, 2011approved, authorizing donation of land to family farmers occupying and/or working said land and sale to larger-scale producers
                         occupying and working the land for at least 5 years;

                         In August 2011, the Bank carried out a public consultation to assess a wide range of actors and interest groups directly associated with policies to promote green development in rural
                         areas (Objective A) and improvement in access and quality of public education (Goal B) of the transaction. The consultations were about: (a) the adequacy of the proposed issues
                         most relevant to the promotion of sustainable development, social inclusion and poverty reduction, (b) the positive and negative impacts they may have on different social groups, and
                         in particular the poorest and most vulnerable, (c) the main challenges and risks to the implementation of these policies in view of these contacts, and (d) the degree of support and
                         sources of resistance to them.
                         During 2010-11, the GoP held 11 territorial forums to discuss the State Pluriannual Plan 2012-2015 (PPA). The participatory process includes two intrinsically-related levels of
                         dialogue intra-government and between government and civil society.

                         By December 2011, the government team had designed and enacted all legal framework under the matrix of development policies.
