SECOND URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Tunisia
Beneficiary:         National Sewerage Authority (ONAS)
Amount:              $26.5 million
Terms:               The loan would be repayable in 17 years, including a
4-year grace period, on a level principal payment basis;
interest would be at 7 percent per year.
Relending Terms:    The loan would be on-lent by the Government to ONAS on the
same terms as the proposed Bank loan. The Government
would assume the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:        The proposed project would support Government's overall
policy of extending sewerage facilities to match the
national program of water supply expansion. It would
consist of: (i) a second stage of sewerage for greater
Tunis which would provide additional treatment capacity
and facilities to improve the existing sewerage and storm
water systems to serve greater Tunis; (ii) a component for
Sfax which would complement existing treatment capacity
and extend and improve the sewer/stormwater system; and
(iii) technical assistance to strengthen the project
planning and control capability of ONAS. The main bene-
fits of the proposed project would be pollution control of
the Lake of Tunis, increased access of urban dwellers in
the target group in Tunis and Sfax to sewerage facilities
with a decrease in health hazards attributable to poor
methods of waste disposal, and institutional improvements
for ONAS, the Sewerage Authority.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA FOR A
SECOND URBAN SEWERAGE PROJECT /
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$26.5 million to help
finance a Second Urban Sewerage Project. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic mission visited Tunisia in June 1978; its
report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia" (No. 2201-TUN)
was issued on November 16, 1978. Country Data sheets are attached in Annex I.
3.        Tunisia is rather poorly endowed with natural resources.  Much of
the country is arid or semi arid. Agricultural activity is concentrated
along the coast, in the North West, and in a few oases, but continues to play
an important role in Tunisia's economic structure. During 1970-77 agriculture
generated some 17 percent of GDP and accounted for some 40 percent of total
employment. The main crops are wheat and olives. These crops are subject to
sharp year-to-year output fluctuations because of irregular rainfall in the
case of wheat and a natural output cycle for olives. Tunisia's most important
raw materials are phosphates, petroleum and natural gas; except for phosphates,
known reserves are relatively small. Industrial development, albeit impres-
sive, has been hampered by shortages of industrial entrepreneurs, the limited
size of the domestic market and difficulties in marketing Tunisian products
abroad. The most important sector is services, which, during 1970-77, gener-
ated about half of GDP, a quarter of that sector's contribution consisting
of government services. Tourism has developed rapidly during the 1970's.
Workers' remittances have become a significant item in the balance of payments,
generating about 10 percent of current account receipts during 1970-77.
4.        Against this background, Tunisia's economy has performed remarkably
well, especially during the 1970's. During 1970-77, real GDP grew at an
average annual rate of 8.6 percent, nearly twice as fast as during the 1960's.
Per capita GNP in 1977 reached $860, which in real terms is some 72 percent
above its level of 1969. According to the 1978 World Bank Atlas, Tunisia
was one of the few countries in the world whose per capita GNP during 1970-76
increased by 6 percent and more.
5.        This performance was partly attributable to improved economic man-
agement and partly to fortuitous factors. During the 1960's, Tunisia's
policy orientation centered on an inward-looking investment strategy based on
state predominance in all important economic activities. Economic management
relied on a complex system of government regulations. In 1969, new policy
orientations were announced, which, during the 1970's, resulted in change



- 2 -
towards a more open and export-oriented economy in which private initiative
could play an increasing role. A number of decontrol measures were introduced,
albeit slowly. Overall, the new policy orientation proved highly beneficial
for the country. In addition, the economy benefited from favorable weather
conditions resulting in good agricultural crops while the change in world mar-
ket prices during 1973/74 brought sizeable windfalls as the terms of trade
improved sharply. This allowed domestic savings to increase to 22 percent of
GDP during 1970-77, compared with 15 percent during the 1960's. Tunisia's
dependence on external financing declined from about 32 percent of investment
in 1969 to 25 percent in 1977; the share was as low as 15 percent during
1973-76, when gains from the terms of trade were at their peak. The balance
of payments had been in continuous overall surplus since 1967, but after
1975 this was no longer the case as the terms of trade began to deteriorate
while imports continued to increase rapidly. However, Tunisia's debt service
ratio in 1977 was still a low 8.9 percent, compared with 20 percent in 1970.
6.        Rapid economic growth allowed Tunisia to make impressive social
gains during the 1970's. By 1976, primary school enrollment had reached 96
percent and secondary enrollment 20 percent of the relevant age groups.
Education is free virtually through university. Public health services have
been expanded, with many services provided free. A family planning program
has been introduced and since 1973 has met with substantial success. The
birth rate declined from 43.8 per thousand in 1966 to 36.4 per thousand in
1976 while the rate of natural growth declined from 3.0 to 2.6 percent in the
same period. Attempts have been made to correct regional imbalances and to
improve income distribution. The share of the population living in absolute
poverty declined from 30 percent in 1966 to 18 percent in 1975. However,
important disparities remain between income levels among individuals and
regions. In coping with the social aspects of development, Tunisia faces
strongly increased aspirations of its population in the face of limited
natural and financial resources.
7.        The most important problem facing the Tunisian economy is widespread
open and hidden unemployment. In 1977, about 13 percent of the labor force--
some 220,000 people--were unemployed and the unemployment rate is rising. In
addition, there is considerable hidden unemployment in agriculture, which
employed about 35 percent of the labor force in 1977. If one considers that
about 40 percent of this labor force do not have full time jobs, the effec-
tive unemployment rate is more like 25 percent. An increasing number of young
people born during the high birth rate years are reaching working age and
a growing number of women are joining the labor force. About half of the
registered unemployed are young people seeking their first employment. These
are mostly relatively educated people whose job aspirations cannot be met.
8.        During 1970-77, agriculture provided about 40 percent of total
employment, 25 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of GDP. Food
processing accounted for another 4 percent of GDP and comprised 35 percent
of value added in manufacturing. During this period agricultural production
rose substantially, largely as a result of favorable weather. Large infra-
structure investments were made during the last decade. Current policy, which
emphasizes projects that make a rapid and direct contribution to production,



- 3 -
recognizes various constraints on agricultural development: insecurity of
tenure; inadequate access to agricultural credit; inadequate extension ser-
vices; insufficient agricultural education; and underutilization of irrigation
investments. Under the Fourth Plan (1973-76) about $140 million was allocated
to a rural development fund executed by the provincial administrations.
9.        During the 1960's, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. This growth rate accelerated in the 1970's to 11 percent
annually, due in part to record years for the olive oil processing industry
and to favorable developments in the textile and chemical industries. The
early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitution
projects. These suffered, however, from the limited domestic market and from
shortages of experienced staff and management.  Since 1970, more emphasis
has been put on export-oriented private industries, particularly in food
processing, textiles, fertilizers and mechanical and electrical industries.
Foreign and domestic private investment is now stimulated by a comprehensive
incentive framework and facilitated by streamlined approval procedures of the
investment promotion agency. Foreign investors are expected to contribute
know-how and overseas marketing capability. Although an agreement between
Tunisia and the European Community signed in April 1976 provided for duty
free entry into the Community of nearly all Tunisian industrial products, new
restrictions have recently been imposed. The Government has established a
special fund to encourage growth of small industries and industrial decentral-
ization, and it has started a program to establish industrial estates.
10.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.  Foreign-
visitor arrivals reached 1 million in 1977, with an average annual rate of
growth during 1970-1977 of 12 percent -- sharply higher than that of the
Mediterranean tourism market as a whole. Since 1970, tourism has become a
major source of foreign exchange earnings, reaching $315 million in 1977;
this was slightly more than earnings from all manufacturing exports and was
exceeded only by petroleum exports. The rapid development of tourism in
Tunisia has unfortunately not been accompanied by adequate development of
infrastructure (particularly recreational facilities), trained manpower, or
related services. The Government is endeavoring to alleviate these con-
straints through a variety of measures including revised investment incentives,
increased marketing and training efforts, codes to enforce quality standards,
and more stringent zoning laws.
11.       The main objectives of the current Five-Year Plan (1977-81) are:
(i) full employment of the additional labor force; (ii) self-sufficiency in
major foodstuffs (defined as a balanced trade account for agricultural goods);
(iii) increases in the standard of living; and (iv) social stability through
incomes policies and wage and price harmonization. The Plan foresees an
average annual rate of real GDP growth of 7.3 percent. This is somewhat below
the 9.2 percent achieved during 1970-76, mainly because the fortuitous factors
prevalent during the early 1970's were not expected to continue. Investment
is projected at D 4.2 billion ($9.8 billion) in current prices during the
Plan. In real terms, average annual investment would be 54 percent greater
during 1977-81 than during the preceding Plan period. Nonetheless, the
targeted average annual rate of growth of real investment during the Fifth



- 4 -
Plan is only 4.1 percent, as this rate is influenced by the very high invest-
ment level achieved in 1976 in an effort to meet targets of the preceding
Plan.
12.       The Fifth Plan's strategy emphasizes in particular export-oriented
industrial development and agricultural growth. Special attention is given to
employment creation and to balance of payments considerations. Substantial
investments are to be made in hydrocarbons, manufacturing, water development,
transport and housing. The Plan prescribes increased domestic production and
processing of Tunisia's mineral resources (phosphates, petroleum) to export as
much value-added as possible. Extraction and distribution of newly discovered
offshore gas deposits in the Gulf of Gabes rank prominently in the list of
major projects. This gas will substitute for petroleum-based fuels, freeing
the latter for export. Eventually, gas will also be used as an input for the
chemical industry. Private sector initiative is expected to dominate invest-
ment in textiles, mechanical and electrical industries, and tourism. It is in
these activities that the authorities expect most employment creation to take
place. Employability of the labor force is to be increased through education
and training programs. Efforts towards regional development are to be pursued
through establishing regional planning structures, strengthening regional
administration and developing incentives for the decentralization of produc-
tive activities. The strategy proposed for the Fifth Plan does not represent
any major departure from the strategy pursued successfully during the preced-
ing Plan.
13.       Tunisia's existing resource base, its institutional and infrastruc-
tural framework, its excellent performance in the earlier part of this decade,
and the desire of the authorities to support further development with appro-
priate policy measures and institutions are fundamental factors pointing
towards continuing rapid economic growth during the Fifth Plan. The 7.3
percent growth target is in line with the possibilities of the economy. The
investment priorities formulated in the Plan are considered necessary to
support the sectoral strategies. There are, however, some less favorable
signs. Tunisia's development recently benefitted from the structural changes
in world market prices and from excellent weather conditions. As noted above,
it cannot be expected that these fortuitous factors will continue in Tunisia's
favor to the same extent as in the past. Hence, Tunisia will have to rely
increasingly on its own resources. As the resource base is relatively narrow,
available resources should be efficiently deployed. Achieving the Plan tar-
gets presupposes the timely introduction and successful execution of measures
to ti) strengthen the absorptive capacity for investment, especially for labor
intensive projects; (ii) promote exports; (iii) base economic management on
an efficient price and incentive system and improve productivity; and (iv)
mobilize the resources needed to realize the comprehensive social development
targets while maintaining domestic and external financial stability. The
Tunisian authorities have begun to introduce measures in these respects.
14.       Substantial efforts in domestic and external resource mobilization
in particular will be of crucial importance to finance the planned level of
investment. On the domestic side, there is a great need for increased savings



and improved financial intermediation. The Government sector, in particular,
will again be called upon to contribute substantially to the savings effort.
The Plan suggests that this should be done by prudent expenditure policies and
increased revenue collections (selective tax increases and better tax collec-
tion). In addition, the public enterprise sector will have to increase sub-
stantially its contribution to public savings through better management and
especially through cost-related increases in the sale prices of selected
enterprises. Externally, Tunisia would have total financing requirements
(disbursement basis) of some $2.8 billion during 1977-81. Given the country's
creditworthiness, Tunisia should be able to mobilize such financing without
putting undue strain on the country's debt servicing capacity (see below,
para. 16).
15.       Since the early 1960's, Tunisia has obtained large amounts of
official aid. A Consultative Group chaired by the Bank has provided a forum
for aid-coordination among major donors (see para. 24). During 1970-77,
annual loan commitments from public sources averaged $235 million, or about
$43 per capita. About 73 percent of these commitments came from bilateral
public sources, chiefly from France, Canada, and the Federal Republic of
Germany. About 17 percent came from oil-producing countries whose share
increased rapidly from 8 percent in 1970 to 29 percent in 1977. Commitments
from the Bank Group during 1970-77 accounted for 20 percent of total public
commitments. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms; in 1977 the
average terms of borrowing were 5.8 percent interest and 20 years maturity,
including 6 years of grace. During 1970-77, Tunisia also received annually
some $43 million in grants. Loan commitments from private sources averaged
$34 million a year. While direct foreign private investment has been compara-
tively small, it has recently picked up momentum following increased activity
in the petroleum sector and new incentives offered to foreign investors in
manufacturing. Net direct foreign investment increased from $19 million in
1970 to $75 million in 1977.
16.       At the end of 1977, total foreign debt (disbursed and outstanding)
was estimated at about $1.6 billion, or 32 percent of GDP compared with some
40 percent in 1970. According to preliminary estimates, it has reached about
$2 billion at the end of 1978. The debt service ratio in 1977 was 8.9 per-
cent, compared with 20 percent in 1970. This significant decline in the debt
service ratio was mainly due to the sharp increase in export earnings follow-
ing the changes in world market prices in 1973/74. External borrowing at the
rate projected in the 1977-81 Plan (para. 14) would increase debt service
obligations in relation to exports to around 13 percent by 1981 and 17 percent
by 1986, according to current Bank projections. At these levels, the debt
service burden would be a manageable one, particularly when seen in the light
of Tunisia's long record of prudent and skillful balance of payments and
external debt management. Tunisia is therefore considered creditworthy for
further Bank lending.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
17.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of thirty-one loans and
eleven credits amounting respectively to $470.5 million and $70.1 million, net
of cancellations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of December 31, 1978, and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects. While disbursements of some loans and credits have
been slower than foreseen at appraisal, on the whole, project execution has
been satisfactory. As of September 30, 1978, total disbursements amounted to
53 percent of initial appraisal forecasts, and to 67 percent of revised fore-
casts. In a number of sectors, important institutional improvements have been
achieved and independent agencies have been created or strengthened.
18.       The Bank's lending strategy in Tunisia aims at supporting Government
efforts to (a) increase employment, (b) encourage more balanced growth and
distribution of income among regions and income groups, (c) promote export-
oriented policies and investments, and (d) provide selective support for the
development of infrastructure and for institution building in key public serv-
ices. The main supporting feature of this lending strategy is to encourage
the Tunisian authorities in timely and well-coordinated preparation of proj-
ects, with emphasis on technical assistance. The Bank is also cooperating
with the Government in its efforts to increase the mobilization of domestic
and foreign resources, in part through encouraging project cofinancing; the
latter is particularly important in view of the extent of Tunisia's external
resource needs, the large size of many priority projects, and the limited
availability of Bank resources relative to the country's needs.
19.       Within this broad framework, past Bank Group lending has emphasized
support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social development.
Lending for urban and social development, including water supply, sewerage,
education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning and public transport
project has accounted for 26 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia since
1971. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure has accounted
for 30 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 19 percent of total
commitments. Industrial and hotel financing through the Banque de Developpe-
ment Economique de Tunisie (BDET) has accounted for 19 percent, and the Gafsa
phosphate development project received 6 percent of total commitments.
20.       The Bank Group has financed four projects in the water supply
sector, and two projects in the sewerage sector in Tunisia, totalling $69.5
million and about $45 million respectively. In the water supply sector, the
first two projects aimed to support the work program of Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE) by financing water supply
works for Tunis, the Sahel Region and the rapidly expanding tourism areas.
Both projects have now been completed satisfactorily. The third and fourth
water supply projects further contributed to improving and extending water
distribution systems for Sfax, the second largest city, and to increasing
SONEDE's water production and distribution capacity in the five northern



.7-
Governorates and in Greater Tunis. A fifth water supply project, which would
help expand SONEDE's water distribution systems in small urban and rural
centers, is scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors during the
current fiscal year. In the sewerage sector, part of the loan for the Tourism
Infrastructure project, currently nearing completion, aimed to upgrade sewerage
facilities in five priority tourism development zones. The first urban sewer-
age project aimed to expand the capacity for sewerage treatment and sewerage
and storm-water collection systems in Greater Tunis. In both sectors, impor-
tant institutional results were achieved with the establishment in 1969 of
SONEDE, the National Water Production and Distribution Company, and in 1975 of
ONAS, the National Sewerage Authority. The creation of a separate authority
for sewerage was appropriate in view of the backlog of work to be tackled and
close cooperation between ONAS and SONEDE has been maintained.
21.       In addition to the proposed loan for a Second Urban Sewerage proj-
ect, loans for a second fisheries project, a fifth water supply project and a
second urban development project are expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the current fiscal year. In the next and subsequent fiscal
years, Bank lending intends to support the two objectives set by the Govern-
ment to balance its economy, namely promotion of agriculture, and of export-
oriented and employment-generating industries. Thus, emphasis will be placed
on agricultural production projects in less developed regions, such as an
irrigation project in Southern Tunisia, an agricultural development project in
the Northwest, and continued assistance for agricultural credit. Bank assis-
tance to industry will focus on small-scale industrial enterprises, mechanical
and electrical industries and possibly rehabilitation of the textile subsector;
this assistance may also include financing for the Miskar project for the
development and distribution of Tunisia's offshore gas resources. The program
would also continue financing selected priority social development projects,
such as a second population project, a vocational training project and further
assistance to education.
22.       The Bank Group accounted for about 20 percent of total public com-
mitments to Tunisia during 1970-77. The Bank Group's shares in total debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1977 (including loans from private
sources) and in debt service during 1977 were 14 percent in both cases. The
Bank Group's share in Tunisia's disbursed external debt by 1986 is expected to
remain unchanged from about 14 percent in 1977, but its share in debt service
would decline to about 12 percent of total.
23.       IFC has invested in NPK Engrais (a fertilizer plant), in BDET, in
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFIT, a company to promote and invest
in tourism projects), in Societe Touristique et Hoteliere RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce alumin-
ium fluoride from local fluorspar for export, and in the Sousse-Nord inte-
grated tourism development project. IFC's net commitments in Tunisia total
$16.1 million. IFC's Board has approved the sale of IFC shares in NPK Engrais
to the Tunisian Government.

PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Supply
24.       The volume of water available in Tunisia for urban, industrial and
agricultural use is limited. Most of the fresh surface water sources are
found very far inland in the mountains, mostly in the northern part of the
country. Only limited volumes of surface water are found in the coastal areas
where the bulk of the population is concentrated; Tunis and Sfax, the two
largest cities in the country, are supplied from surface sources located more
than 120 km away. Although some groundwater is available along the coastline,
the volume that can be extracted is often limited because of the progressive
intrusion of sea water into the aquifers. Demands for potable water and irri-
gation are projected to exceed the total available supplies of fresh water by
the year 2000. Beyond that time it will probably become necessary to resort
to desalination of brackish or sea water and recycling of waste-waters to
meet the demand. To conserve scarce water resources, Government enacted a
water code in 1975 to regulate the collection and use of water and to estab-
lish usage priorities.
25.       The Ministry of Agriculture has traditionally managed all water
resources in the country. The production and distribution of potable water
are the responsibility of SONEDE, the national water authority, which is an
autonomous public utility established in 1968 under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Agriculture. By an accelerated program of house connections,
SONEDE has increased its service ratio from 43 percent of the urban population
at the time of its establishment, to a current level of 68 percent.
Sewerage
26.       The development of sewerage has lagged behind that of water supply.
Thus, although the percentage of the urban population nominally served is
roughly comparable to that for water, in many centers treatment capacity is
now insufficient to cope with the volume of waste-water discharged, and sewer
systems are suffering from inadequate maintenance. This situation resulted
from the fragmentation of responsibility between municipalities, the low level
of investment and lack of experienced staff. Recognizing the need rapidly to
upgrade sewerage facilities and improve their operation, the Government estab-
lished a national sewerage authority, the Office National d'Assainissement
(ONAS), to assume responsibility under the Ministry of Equipment for the plan-
ning, operation, maintenance, renewal and construction of all sewerage works
located within the limits of the communes and within tourism or industrial
development zones. ONAS started its work on July 1, 1975, and has taken over
the sewerage systems of Tunis and several other cities. Considerable progress
has already been made in rehabilitation of systems and expansion of treatment
capacity.



Sector Development Strategy
27.       The basic objectives of sector policy are as follows:
(a) to extend the provision of potable water to an increasing
proportion of the total population of 5.9 million in mid-
1977 (of which 47 percent live in urban areas), with a
target of 76 percent of urban residents by 1981 and. 81
percent by 1985; of the rural population, potable water
would be provided to about 1 million inhabitants in rural
agglomerations; the remaining rural population lives in
isolated dwellings which cannot readily be served by public
water distribution and sewerage systems; and
(b) to eliminate the imbalance between water supply and waste-
water treatment capacity by the mid-1980's.
28.       The Government has prepared three master plans for water resource
development in Northern, Central, and Southern Tunisia. In 1969, the Bank
made a technical assistance grant for preparation of the Plan for Northern
Tunisia, and acted as Executing Agency for the study. The Plan envisages
multipurpose development of resources, with priority to development of irriga-
tion and domestic uses. The Bank-financed Sidi-Salem Multipurpose Project
(Loan No. 1431-TUN) aims to contribute to implementation of the first phase of
this master plan. Preparation work is advancing for an irrigation development
project in the South, as part of implementation of the Master Plan for the
South. The Water Master Plan for Central Tunisia is currently under Bank
review.
29.       To maximize the benefits obtainable from limited resources -- both
physical and financial -- Government is giving priority to water supply devel-
opment in the areas of highest population density. This leads to increased
volumes of wastewater to be collected, treated and disposed of in centers
which lack, in many cases, adequate sewerage facilities, Government's recog-
nition of the need for sewerage to catch up with water supply is evidenced
by the growth of budgetary allocations for sewerage, which at DT 73 million
(US$172 million) for the Fifth Plan (1977-81) represent an increase of 50
percent in real terms over the Fourth Plan allocations.
30.       To implement this expansion of urban sewerage, ONAS retained consul-
tants to carry out a general study of the sewerage subsector in order to estab-
lish a national program of works in order of priority. On the basis of these
studies, ONAS has planned an investment program covering the remainder of the
Fifth Plan and the first two years of the Sixth Plan (through 1983). This
plan provides for continued expansion of sewerage works in major urban centers,
in tourism zones, and in small urban communities.
Performance under previous Bank-financed projects
31.       Performance under the various water projects has been good.  How-
ever, two projects with sewerage components have suffered considerable delays



- 10 -
and are currently about 18-20 months behind schedule. The Tourism Infrastruc-
ture Project (Loan 858-TUN/Credit 329-TUN) is being implemented with delays
and had to be revised as the result of changes in the Government's tourism
development objectives in 1975 and of the recommendations of detailed studies
on the six priority tourism zones financed under the project. As regards the
First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN), difficulties were encountered in
staffing ONAS, the new sewerage Authority created under the project, and in
transferring to it the systems and employees from the centers taken over by
ONAS. Despite these difficulties ONAS has greatly improved its operating
efficiency. Recalibration of the sewer system in Tunis and construction of
new sewers in Tunis and other towns are now under way; the Cherguia treatment
plant has been rehabilitated and extended to serve about 800,000 inhabitants,
and two other treatment plants, one each for the northern and southern suburbs
of Tunis, are under construction. When these works are completed in 1981,
pollution of the Lake of Tunis will abate and its northern bank will be
available for various uses. Consultant studies financed under the first
Sewerage project to determine the use of land around the lake have been
completed and "Agence Fonciere de l'Habitat" is systematically buying private
land around the lake, to control its use. There remain, however, certain
aspects of ONAS' management and technical competence which need improvement,
to achieve greater effectiveness in project execution. These are being
addressed in the context of the proposed project (see para 43-44).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       In late 1977, Tunisia asked the Bank to assist in financing a second
urban sewerage project, comprising works in Greater Tunis and Sfax. The proj-
ect represents priority segments of the sewerage master plan for Tunisia
recently completed by consultants retained by ONAS. The project was appraised
in June/July 1978 and negotiations were held in Washington from December 15 to
21. The staff Appraisal Report (No. 2252-TUN) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. The main features of the Loan and the Project are
mentioned in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. A map showing the
location of the two cities covered by the Project is also attached.
Project Objectives
33.       The proposed project would contribute to correcting the serious
imbalance between water supply and wastewater treatment and disposal capacity,
and to extending sewerage service to a larger proportion of the population.
Thus, by 1985, 89 percent of dwellings in Tunis would be served with sewerage
facilities (including virtually all those provided with piped water), compared
with 77 percent at present; in Sfax, a significant reduction would be made in
the flood hazard and associated health risks which currently affect large
parts of the city. In addition, the proposed project would further develop
the managerial and technical capability of ONAS to implement its investment
program.



Project Description
34.       The proposed project would consist of:
(i) a second stage development of sewerage facilities for Greater
Tunis;
(ii) improvement and extension of existing sewerage facilities for
Sfax; and
(iii) technical assistance to strengthen the planning and control
capacity of ONAS.
Sewerage Works in Tunis
35.       The component envisaged for Greater Tunis would be a continuation of
the sewerage improvement program initiated under the first Urban Sewerage
Project (see para 31). A new treatment plant would be built to augment exist-
ing treatment capacity. This plant would discharge treated sewage through
the Khelidj canal into the Mediterranean Sea, where the pollution effects of
treated sewage would be minimal; the Lake of Tunis would thus be protected
from further sewage discharge. It is expected that in the medium-term treated
wastewater would be used for irrigation. The project would also complete the
recalibration -- i.e. replacement of existing pipes with wider ones -- of the
combined sewer/stormwater system in Central Tunis initiated under the first
sewerage project. Trunk sewer additions and sewer system extensions would
provide service to about 394 ha presently without service, including the three
major squatter settlements in Greater Tunis, with an estimated population of
120,000. Individual sewer connections in two of the three squatter areas are
being provided under the proposed Second Urban Development project which is
scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors later this fiscal year.
Stormwater systems would also be extended in the suburbs most prone to flood-
ing.
36.       The configuration of the project works for Greater Tunis follows the
sewerage master plan for that city recently completed by consultants retained
by ONAS. This plan, which reflects the Tunis regional development plan pub-
lished in 1977, has been accepted by ONAS and approved by the District of
Tunis (the planning authority). It represents the results of the review of a
number of alternatives in a search for flexibility to accommodate alternative
patterns of population distribution, and the least-cost method of sewage
treatment and disposal.
Sewerage Works in Sfax
37.       In Sfax, the project consists of facilities to improve the existing
system and to convey the sewage from the combined system to the treatment
plant presently under construction. A new pumping station will be built.
About 2.2 km of stormwater/sewage collectors and 2.8 km of stormwater col-
lectors would be installed to overcome the serious problem of flooding and
sewage overflow, and about 15 km of sewer extensions would be built. The
Sfax scheme is also based on studies carried out by consultants.



- 12 -
Implementation
38.       ONAS will be responsible for project implementation, including
design, contract preparation and construction. Consultants to assist with
final design of the first component of the project (the outfall) have already
been recruited; during negotiations, ONAS agreed to recruit, by August 1, 1979,
consultants for design of the remaining project works (Draft Project Agreement,
Section 2.02). About US$2.0 million is provided in the proposed loan to
cover the foreign cost of these services. Final designs and tender documents
will be completed by end 1979 for urgent works and end 1981 for the later
works. According to the project time schedule agreed upon by ONAS, construc-
tion would be completed by end 1983.
39.       The construction program which ONAS is now embarking on will be
both bigger and also more widely dispersed geographically than anything the
authority has tackled so far, and it is important that planning and control
should be coordinated and strengthened. ONAS has agreed to hire experienced
specialist consultants to strengthen the project planning and control capacity
of its divisions (Draft Project Agreement, Section 3.03). These consultants
would help (i) coordinate the planning and design of all parts of ONAS' pro-
gram; and (ii) develop and install a proper system of project planning and
control, and train the personnel of ONAS in its use. About $0.6 million
of the proposed loan is earmarked for these consultant services. An under-
standing was also reached during negotiations on the consultants' terms-of-
reference.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
40.       The total cost of the project is estimated at DT 32.9 million
(US$77.5 million) including allowances for physical contingencies and expected
price escalation. The cost estimates are based on current bid awards for
pipes, pumps, treatment equipment and civil works procured under the on-going
first sewerage project. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$26.5 million or about 34 percent of total project costs; this is on the
assumption that, in view of the underemployment currently affecting the
Tunisian construction industry, most of the civil works contracts will go to
local firms. The proposed Bank loan would cover all the estimated foreign
exchange costs of the project. About 102 man-months of consultant services
for project planning and control would be financed at an average total cost of
about $9,100 per man-month (see para. 39).
41.       The Republic of Tunisia will be the borrower of the proposed loan,
and will on-lend the proceeds of the loan to ONAS. Direct lending to ONAS
was considered, but deemed inappropriate, because ONAS is at present dependent
on the Government for more than half of its income. Decreased dependence of
ONAS on Government payments in the future, coupled with strengthened manage-
ment and financial control, would better qualify ONAS to receive direct Bank
assistance eventually. Present domestic long-term commercial bank lending
rates in Tunisia range from 5.5 to 8.75 percent. Inflation in the past
three years has averaged 7.2 percent as indicated by the cost-of-living
index; the inflation rate forecast for the next three years is 6 percent.



- 13 -
In keeping with standard Tunisian policy, the Government would assume the
foreign exchange risk. Considering the public utility character of ONAS,
on-lending at terms similar to those of the Bank loan would be appropriate
and reasonable (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01b). The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ONAS on these terms
would be a condition of effectiveness (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 6.01b).
42.        The local funds required for project completion would be provided
in part from ONAS' cash flow, and the remainder by Government in the form of
equity contributions to ONAS. The amounts of such contributions required
through 1981 are within the limits allocated by the Planning Ministry for the
Fifth Plan period. Government would provide these funds promptly to ONAS, and
also any funds necessary to meet foreign cost overruns (Draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01a and c).
Organization and Management
43.       ONAS is a semi-autonomous agency, established in 1974 under the
Ministry of Equipment. Responsibility for executive management is vested
in a President Director General (PDG) and that for policy in a Board of
Directors. The PDG is assisted by four department directors and five heads
of services, who report individually to him. While most of these directors
and service heads are qualified and capable, many of them are young and
relatively inexperienced. As a consequence, they tend to refer decisions to
the PDG, whose attention is thus fragmented between many matters of detail.
With the projected growth of ONAS' activities in the medium-term, there is
need to strengthen its management to allow greater delegation of decision-
making and enhance the effectiveness of operation. During negotiations, ONAS'
PDG discussed with the Bank and agreed on a number of measures to strengthen
management. These measures will be put into effect by December 31, 1979
(Draft Project Agreement, Section 3.02). Other measures to strengthen ONAS'
capacity to implement its expansion program are discussed in paragraph 39.
44.       ONAS' past audit reports revealed weaknesses in internal control and
errors in the records. The seriousness of this situation and the need for
urgent remedial measures, to be taken in consultation with the auditors, have
been brought to the attention of ONAS' PDG. As a result, a crash improvement
program has been initated and staff and procedural changes were made. Further
remedial measures are linked to management improvement proposals discussed in
paragraph 43 above.
Financial Position of ONAS
45.       ONAS derives its revenues from a number of charges and contribu-
tions, including a payment from Government, whose structure and levels were
established in consultation with the Bank in the context of the First Urban
Sewerage project. The authoritiy earned a positive net income in the 1975-77
financial years and is expected to do so again in 1978. The cost of ONAS'
increasing scale of operations and the burden of debt service will require,
however, a three fold increase in revenues by 1983. About 60 percent of this
increase would be provided by new consumers, whose number is expected to



- 14 -
increase through takeover by ONAS of sewerage systems not presently operated
by ONAS, and through new connections planned in ONAS' capital work program.
The remaining 40 percent of the needed additional revenue would have to be
secured by rate increases.
46.       ONAS' latest rate structure became effective as recently as December
1978. The combined charges for water supply and wastewater disposal in Tunisia
are well in line with neighboring countries, and are kept affordable to poor
consumers by the use of preferential rates for low consumption. Further sewer
rate increases would not be practicable before 1980. In that year a tariff
increase of about 50 percent on average will be necessary. Another increase of
about 20 percent would also be necessary during 1983. The Project Agreement
for Loan 1088-TUN calls for a review of Government payments to be completed by
July 1, 1980 and each five years thereafter. During negotiations, ONAS agreed
to review its user charges not later than December 31, 1980 and each year
thereafter and to consult with the Government and the Bank on any subsequent
tariff adjustments (Draft Project Agreement, Section 4.04).
47.       On the basis of these tariff adjustments, which are considered rea-
sonable and feasible, ONAS will continue to earn a positive net income through
the period of project construction. Net operational cash flow will be at least
twice the debt service throughout the period. Cash generation will remain a
minimum of 4 percent of net assets (Draft Project Agreement, Section 4.03).
During negotiations, ONAS provided informal assurances that it would initiate
a study to determine an appropriate formula to revalue its assets for purposes
of calculating this ratio. At the end of 1983 (the last year of project
construction) the debt/equity ratio will be about 40:60, leaving the authority
reasonably capitalized to embark on subsequent stages of its investment program.
Procurement
48.       Local contractors are capable of competitively carrying out works
such as the manufacture and installation of pipes, and the civil works of
pumping stations and treatment plants. Only mechanical and electrical equip-
ment of pumping stations and treatment plant will be imported. The project
works will comprise about 25 contracts, which, except as noted below, will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. For bid evaluation purposes, a 15 percent
margin of preference or an amount equal to custom duties, whichever is lower,
would be applied in the case of equipment manufactured in Tunisia. Contracts
for civil works, materials and equipment of less than $150,000 aggregating not
more than $1,500,000 would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally. Certain specialized equipment, up to an aggregate value
not exceeding $500,000 may be obtained by procurement procedures acceptable to
the Bank (Draft Project Agreement, Schedule 1, para C). The Bank loan would
be disbursed between mid-1979 and mid-1984.
Monitoring Arrangements
49.       To evaluate the performance of ONAS in implementing this project,
ONAS has agreed to follow monitoring criteria in addition to normal reporting



- 15 -
procedures to the Bank (Draft Project Agreement, Schedule 2). These criteria
will include: total cumulative sewer connections, connection rates for popu-
lation served, and financial and performance indicators.
Benefits and Risks
50.       In Tunis, the proposed project,which follows the Master Plan prepared
by consultants for the phased development of sewerage in Greater Tunis, is the
least cost solution selected by consultants among five possible alternatives.
It would consolidate and protect the benefits expected from the pollution con-
trol program initiated under the First Urban Sewerage Project for the Lake
of Tunis. Expressed in terms of the increased value in lakeshore land thus
released for development, and the potential value of the fish catch in the
Lake, this aspect of the first and second projects shows a rate of return of
18 percent. In addition, the proposed project would contribute to improving
sanitary conditions in Tunis and Sfax, with a greatly reduced risk of infec-
tion from inadequate human waste disposal methods, overflowing septic drains
and polluted water. In Sfax, a significant reduction would be made in the
flood hazard and associated health risk which currently affect large parts of
the city.
51.       Together with the Second Urban Development Project, for which a Bank
loan is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors for approval this
fiscal year, the proposed project would make a significant contribution to the
Government's Municipal Development Programs for Tunis and Sfax. Together,
the projects will provide improved housing and sewerage facilities to about
120,000 urban dwellers (or about half the estimated number of urban poor) in
the Tunis District. Finally, the proposed project would strengthen ONAS'
capacity to implement its sewerage investment program (see paragraph 39, 43
and 44 above).
52.       The major risks confronting the project are those of slippage in
the construction program, and consequent escalation of cost. Experience to
date with ONAS during the implementation of the First Urban Sewerage Project
has been disappointing on these grounds although ONAS' performance in other
respects has been acceptable (see para 31). This limited performance is
attributable both to administrative bottlenecks and to ONAS' inexperience
resulting from its recent creation. The execution schedule for the proposed
project takes account of these constraints. It is envisaged that ONAS' effec-
tiveness would be enhanced through the strengthening of its top management to
allow greater delegation of authority and more effective decision-making and
the provision of technical assistance to coordinate and strengthen its project
planning and control capability (see paras. 39 and 43). By thus addressing
both the technical and executive bottlenecks, there is reasonable ground to
expect improved performance from ONAS in the future in both the First and this
proposed project.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and ONAS, and the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.       A special condition of effectiveness listed in Section III of Annex
III is the execution of a project agreement between the Bank and ONAS and
an agreement between the Government and ONAS for onlending proceeds of the
proposed loan, on terms similar to those of the proposed Bank loan (Draft
Loan Agreement, Section 6.01).
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

DEFINITIONS OF SOCIAL INDICATORS
The adjusted group averages for each indicator are population-weighted geometric means, excluding the extreme values of the indicator and the nost
populated country in each group. Coverage of countries among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform. Due to lack of data,
group averages for Capital Surplus Oil Exporters and indicators of access to water and excreta disposal, housing, income distribution and poverty are
simple population-weighted geometric means without the exclusion of extrem values.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 238:    Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
Cr. 238-1:  Population Project:  US$4.8 million Supplemental Credit of
October 13, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: March 21, 1977;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1979.
Under the Government's new decentralized and integrated health
policy, the national family planning program continues to show good progress.
The last of the 29 MCH clinics are expected to be completed by the end of
March, 1979. Three of the four maternity hospitals are close to completion,
and the fourth, at Bizerte, is scheduled for completion late this calendar
year. Bids have been invited for the procurement of furniture and equipment.
The Avicenne training school is completed, equipped, and functioning. Because
of delays encountered in construction, the closing date of the project has
been extended to December 31, 1979.
Cr. 270:    Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: May 24, 1972; Closing Date: (Original) December
31, 1976; (Current) September 30, 1979.
About 90 percent of project funds are now disbursed and all the 190
boats ordered have now been constructed. The Office National des Peches (ONP)
shipyards in Bizerte and Sfax have completed 65 and 50 boats respectively and
the shipyard in Sousse has completed 75 boats. More loan requests for the
financing of additional fishing gear will have to be processed in 1979 to dis-
burse the remainder of the credit, and it is estimated that project completion
can be achieved by June 30, 1979. However, the recovery of loans provided
under the project to the fishermen remains a matter of concern as the recovery
rate has been low and measures taken to improve the situation have not yet
given results. BNT have been advised to recruit without delay additional
recovery agents in its branches along the coast whose main task would be the
collection of installments in the places where fishermen land and sell their
catch.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 858:  Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan  of September 28,
1972; Date of Effectiveness: June 29, 1973; Closing Date:
(Original) December 31, 1977; (Current) June 30, 1980.
The project has entered its final implementation stage. An esti-
mated 50 percent of project works have been completed. All construction works
should be completed by the end of 1979. Total project cost, including price
escalation allowances, is still estimated at TD 31.5 million. Of the total
Bank financing of $24 million (including the fully disbursed Credit 329), 57
percent, or $13.7 million, has been disbursed.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: May 24, 1973; Closing
Date: (Original) March 31, 1978 ; (Current) June 30, 1979.
Ln. 1189: Sixth Development Finance Company Project; US$20 million loan of
January 26, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: June 7, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
The closing date of Loan 881 has been postponed to June, 1979 to
permit BDET to disburse the last $0.6 million in the Loan account toward a
few subprojects which encountered implementation delays. The utilization
of the loan has been generally in line with the appraisal report's projec-
tions, which foresaw the loan to be fully disbursed by March, 1977. Dis-
bursement on Loan 1189, which is also fully committed, reached $16.8 million
as of December, 1978, about 6 months ahead of the schedule projected in the
appraisal report. BDET has shown consistent improvements over the past three
years in the key areas of management effectiveness, arrears recovery, finan-
cial practices and resource mobilization. The institution plays an increas-
ingly important role in financing industrial development, extending about
one-third of all term credit available to the industrial sector in Tunisia.
Ln. 937: Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973; Date
of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
The major part of the project has been implemented and most of the
objectives have been met. The project helped establish and strengthen the
Tunis District, the first regional planning authority in Tunisia. Work
carried out by the District in the housing and transport sectors has been
instrumental in bringing about substantial changes in public programs and
policies, such as the adoption of measures to encourage the use of buses and
restrain the use and parking of private cars. The project also assisted the
public transport company Societe Nationale des Transport (SNT) in renewing its
bus fleet and railway rolling stock, improving its organization and finance,
and upgrading the maintenance of its vehicles with the construction of a new
bus depot. In parallel, the city of Tunis adopted a new traffic plan with
a one-way street system, reserved bus lanes and restricted parking zones,
which contributed substantially to the improvement of bus services in Greater
Tunis. This, combined with an increase in the SNT bus fleet, and improved bus



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 7
maintenance has led to an increase in the use of SNT transport facilities by
about 27 percent above the level which would have been achieved in the absence
of the project. The construction of the last project component, a bus depot,
is now scheduled to start in May-June 1979.
Ln. 989:  Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1979; (Current) December 31, 1979.
Ln. 1445: Fourth Water Supply Project; US$21 million loan of July 5, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: January 30, 1978; Closing Date: December
31, 1982.
Most of the civil works programmed under the third project are now
completed. The project is expected to be fully completed by June 1979, some
six months behind the appraisal schedule. Preliminary financial results as
of September 30, 1978 indicate that SONEDE will meet the rate of return
covenant and debt service requirement for 1978. The proportion of cash in
SONEDE's current assets of 2.4 percent in 1978 is considered low. However, it
is expected that from 1979 onwards, due to tariff increases and other contribu-
tions, cash will gradually increase to an adequate level.  As far as current
assets are concerned, SONEDE agreed that attention would continue to be given
to inventory management in order to reduce stocks to a more appropriate level.
Good progress has been accomplished in the execution of the works included
in the Fourth Water Supply Project. Final engineering design of the project
components, with the exception of the water treatment plant, is completed,
and laying out of the project facilities and soil tests are under way. It
is now expected that, except for the treatment plant, procurement under the
project should be completed by mid-1979.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: (Original)
October 31, 1978; (Current) October 31, 1980.
Civil works for the first two centers started in July 1977. They
have met with delays largely because of shortages in imported materials and
are now expected to be completed by April 1979. For the remaining equipment
contracts, bids were opened on October 30, 1978 and contracts are in the
process of being awarded. Revised cost estimates indicate a project cost of
TD 7.8 million (US$17.8 million), 45 percent higher than the appraisal esti-
mate. ONTT has proposed that the third center be deleted from the project and
that residual funds (US$1 million) be applied to the first two centers. This
proposal is being evaluated in the Bank.

tended to supply phosphate rock to the Sehib beneficiation plant to be commis-
sioned by the end of 1979. Following the failure of the related tests to
reach satisfactory production levels a partial reformulation of the project
will be carried out with the assistance of experienced consultants whose
services will be financed by the unused portion of the Bank loan. The ser-
vices will include (i) a 15-18 months assistance in further testing the
longwall method, (ii) a feasibility study for dragline mining of an adjacent
deposit, (iii) a review of the corporate five-year investment program with a
view to designing and implementing an improved cost control system. In the
next 5-6 years the beneficiation plant will be supplied with ore mined at a
close-by small deposit until a new and bigger deposit will be ready for
operations.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$12.2 million loan of
December 31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Progress in construction and rehabilitation work in the Medjerda
sub-project area continues to be satisfactory, except for water supply to
farmers on which a common decision is expected by SONEDE and OMVVM, regard-
ing the latter's contribution to the investment costs. Some progress has
been made since May 1978 in enforcing the Agrarian Reform Legislation.
OMVVM continues to encourage large owners to improve cultivation of land
and marked progress has been reported in credit distribution for medium and
short term. In Nebhana, the land consolidation program is developing well
and farmers have been settled on nearly 60 percent of the total area.
Progress in construction and rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and roads
networks continues to be satisfactory.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; US$28 million loan of February 18,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date
December 15, 1979.
The project has suffered considerable delay as a result of a number
of factors, some beyond the control of the project entity, ONAS. As a result,
considerable cost escalation has occurred, chiefly in local cost components.
However, bids for most of the works have now been received and construction
will shortly be under way on all major components.  The project is expected
to be completed in mid-1981. One of its major benefits will be release of
land for development around Tunis Lake, which is presently impossible because
of the pollution of the lake waters by untreated sewage. Consultants financed
under the project have produced a land-use plan for the area, and acquisition
of the land has begun by Government.

Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975:
Date of Effectiveness: March 1, 1976: Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Following a change in the educational priorities in Tunisia, the
government and the Bank have recently agreed to reformulate the project. Dis-
bursements have commenced recently.
Ln. 1188: Second Highways Project; US$28 million loan of January 26, 1976:
Date of Effectiveness: June 16, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
Civil works of Lots 9 and 10 of the Tunis-Bizerte highway are behind
schedule although quality of works is generally satisfactory. Construction
has recently started on Lot 6: alternative bypasses of Nabeul, Hammamet and
Korba are under study by the Sous-Direction des Etudes. Construction works of
Lots 5, 7 and 11 have not started yet due to lack of local financing and, in
the case of Sfax bypass, delays in expropriation. The local financing issue
has been discussed with the Ministries of Public Works and Planning. The
revised intermediate report of the transport coordination study is behind
schedule, but the consultants expect to conclude the study on time.
Ln 1340:  Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$12 million loan of
November 23, 1976: Date of Effectiveness: July 19, 1977: Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
About 21 percent of the amount envisaged at loan signature was dis-
bursed by the end of December. The appraisal of subloans for small farmers
under category 1 of the Project is now progressing and BNT has made the first
commitments. The funds earmarked for SONAM are fully disbursed and prospects
are good for the commitment of funds for service cooperatives to small and
medium size farms. Commitments of funds made by BNT under categories 2 and 4
are progressing satisfactorily but due to cumbersome administrative procedures
and other technical problems, subloan applications of SCMVS under category 3
have been delayed. To overcome these difficulties, BNT and the Ministry of
Agriculture have proposed new procedures, and BNT is expected soon to notify
the Bank officially of the new standard loan conditions.
Ln. 1355: Second Power Project; US$14.5 million loan of January 12, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: May 4, 1977: Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The Project comprises 7 gas-turbine units of equal size totalling
150 MW to be installed in different locations. Its cost is estimated at
US$28.7 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$24.8
million equivalent. The Project has been almost completed. The energy
pricing study has started after some delay.

Ln. 1431: Sidi Salem Multi-purpose Project; US$42 million loan of July 5, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: July 31, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The effectiveness of the loan was delayed because of difficulties in
finalizing the cofinancing arrangements. This has not retarded project execu-
tion. For the project as a whole, progress in implementation continues to be
satisfactory. However, implementation of the diversion tunnels is about three
months behind original schedule. Accelerated efforts to mobilize equipment
and hire staff are needed to complete construction of both tunnels by the
end of August 1979. Progress in implementation of the railroad substructure
is also slightly behind schedule. The land reform and consolidation program
has been developing on schedule.
Ln. 1504/1505: Industrial Finance Project consisting of Seventh Loan to
Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and a Pilot
project for assistance to SSI; Loans of $30.0 million to BDET and
of $5.0 million to the Government, of January 25, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: October 13, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The start up of the project suffered from difficulties in finalizing
legal arrangements concerning the SSI Pilot Project component, which delayed
effectiveness by about six months.  No disbursements have, therefore, taken
place yet under either component of the project. Commitments under the loan
to BDET have built up rapidly after effectiveness, so that the loan is expected
to be disbursed on schedule.  Under the project, BDET is giving priority in
its financing to projects which are located in the least developed regions,
sponsored by new entrepreneurs, characterized by high labor intensity, or
export-orientation. No commitments have been made, yet, under the SSI pilot
project; however, considerable progress have been made by the Tunisian authori-
ties toward setting up a network of Tunisian and foreign technical assistance
experts, specifically catering to the needs of SSI, as agreed under the
project.
