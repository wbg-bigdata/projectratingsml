Description         The proposed loan i s intended to support the Government of
                    Bulgaria to meet some o f the challenges o f EU accession and
                    integration. In particular the DPL will support the adoption
                    and implementation o f policies to (i) improve the institutional
                    framework inthe labor and social sectors to more closely align
                    their policies with EU standards; and (ii)improve the
                    efficiency o f the health, education, and social protection
                    systems to maintain a fiscally sustainable expenditure
                    framework and improve access to basic social services.
Benefits            It is expected that at the end o f the DPL series (i)the
                    employment rate will have increased to at least 60 percent, (ii)
                    the hospital sector will be streamlined and more resources will
                    be allocated to outpatient care, therefore reaching a larger
                    percentage o f the underserved population, (iii) a basic package
                    o f drugs will become more affordable and therefore available
                    to a wider segment o f the population; and (iv) quality o f
                    education will have improved, and completion rates will have
                    increased.
Risks               1) Political risks include (i) possibility that the coalition
                                                    the
                    government o f three parties may not be able to reach
                    consensus on some important reforms; (ii)      opposition to new
                    education funding formula and changes inhealth financing and
                    provision by some stakeholders (teachers union, municipalities
                    that will see a loss in resources for education or closing o f
                    hospitals, BulgarianMedical Association)

                    2) Technical risks include the limited implementation capacity
                    insomelineministries

                    3) Institutional risks include the potential change in attitude o f
                    the government towards future phases o f the D P L now that the
                    accession to the EU has materialized, reducing the leverage

                                                                                        5

                   capacity o fthe World Bank to guide policy changes.

                   4) Macro risks are related to Bulgaria's economic vulnerability
                   due to the country's significant current account deficit,
                   inflation pressure, and the fiscal demands o f EU accession
                   which may grow inthe future.

                   Mitigation measures include (i)involving all parties in the
                   coalition through     work     with their representatives     in
                   government (deputy ministers);        (ii)devising mitigation
                   measures to counteract potential negative impact of change in
                   education financing formula; (iii) other Bank instruments
                                                       use
                   (investment loans, grants) to build capacity at line ministries;
                   (iv) building a relationship with EU teams supervising
                   Bulgaria's early EUmembership process; (v) supporting labor
                   policies aimed at increasing flexibility in the labor market and
                   facilitating adjustments o f the economy inresponse to negative
                   aggregate shocks; and (vi) increasing the Bank's surveillance
                   once the IMF moves fiom monitoring an active program to
                   surveillance.

          PROPOSEDFIRST SOCIAL SECTORSINSTITUTIONAL REFORM
                             DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                           FOR THE REPUBLIC OFBULGARIA

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document (PD) describes the first o f three planned Social Sectors
Institutional Reform Development Policy Loans (SIR-DPL Ior simply DPL I).        The proposed
loans are intended to support the Government o f Bulgaria (GOB)to meet some o f the
challenges o f integrating into the EU. Inparticular the DPL series will support the adoption
and implementationo fpolicies to:

    Improve the institutional framework in the labor and social sectors to more closely align
    their policies with EUstandards; and
    Improve the efficiency o f the health, education, and social protection systems to maintain
    a fiscally sustainable expenditure framework and improve access to basic social services.

2.      The policies supported by the D P L series were not fully reflected or guided by the
adoption o f the acquis communautaire and other accession processes, but remain nonetheless
relevant for the integration agenda, because o f their focus on fiscal sustainability, social
inclusion and access to services, issues that have been highlighted by the European Union
(EU) in the various assessment reports o f candidate countries. The need to address these
issues during early membership has been a key lesson from the experience o f the EU new
member states.     In addition, the policies supported by the DPL series will increase the
transparency o f public expenditures for health and education and in that way support the
Government o f Bulgaria (G0B)'s efforts to reduce corruption - a key concern o f the
European Commission (EC) with respect to Bulgaria's integration into the EU.

3.      DPL Iwill be the first policy-based operation prepared entirely by the new governing
coalition which won the Parliamentary election inJune 2005. The new Government has come
to power with an ambitious reform agenda, as reflected inthe health sector strategy currently
being discussed with the country's key stakeholders and the education sector strategy
approved by Parliament in June 2006, and with the commitment to implement the Joint
Inclusion Memorandum signed with the EU in 2005.              By selectively supporting the
implementation o f some o f the components o f these two strategies as well as the introduction
o f changes to current labor market and social protection policies, the DPL series will
complement and expand the work undertaken under the recently completed Programmatic
Adjustment Loan (PAL) program. The previous PAL program covered a broad range o f
topics ranging from infrastructure and the financial sectors to social services. Following
completion of the P A L program and during the preparation o f the recently approved Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) the government requested assistance from the Bank to continue
supporting reforms inthe social sectors and it was agreed that the DPL series would focus on
these sectors exclusively.

4.      The first phase o f the program i s dominated by the introduction o f changes in the
social protection sector to create additional incentives for employment generation, and the
definition o f a new fbnding mechanism for schools. These measures are accompanied by

                                                                                             7

actions to stabilize public spending on health, mitigate the impact o f the changes ineducation
financing on access, and improving the institutional capacity in the education and health
sectors. The second phase will focus on supporting full implementation o f the new education
financing formula, introduction o f governance changes in the sector, implementation o f some
o f the actions included inthe medium term vision for social protection, and additional actions
to maintain financial balance inthe health sector. The third phase supports the consolidation
o f the financing and governance reforms in the education sector and implementation o f
structural reforms in the supply o f health care services; this phase is also expected to show
some early results from the previous two phases o f program implementation. The reforms are
progressing at a different pace owing to the different degree o f preparedness inthe sectors, the
structural and medium-term nature o f some o f the reforms, and the time necessary to build
consensus for major policy changes, but the program is balancedover the three phases.

5.      In some cases the DPL series will support only the initial phase of policy changes.
Many o f the issues are complex and the necessary policy reforms are long-term innature-
most EU countries are still struggling with some o f the problems tackled in this DPL series.
For example, the restructuring o f the supply o f health care services i s a long term policy that
will show some early results towards the end o f the program but will not be fully
implemented until after the program's ending.          In the case of education financing, full
implementationwill require at least three years because the reallocation o f resources resulting
from the change inthe financing formula can create large differences between the current and
the revised allocations among municipalities. Therefore it is necessary to provide some time
for municipalities to adapt to these changes to avoid any adverse impact on access to
education services. This i s one o f the key reasons why a programmatic approach has been
chosen. While longer to implement, the first irreversible steps to change the financing of the
education sector financing, establish a system for student assessment, and restructuring the
hospital sector will have been taken before the end o f the D P L series.          The long-term
outcomes to which the D P L program i s contributing, but which are not likely to be realized
until after the three-year DPL program, are an increase in employment and reduction inlong
term unemployment, an increase in quality o f education and increased access to underserved
populations, and an improvement in health outcomes through better access to basic health
care and drugs.

6.      The accession o f Bulgaria to the EU represents a turning point in its history. If the
experience o f new member states is any indication, this will also alter the nature o f Bulgaria's
relationship with the Bank. Inthat sense, the value added o f the DPL can be found not only in
providing budget support for the implementation o f reforms, but also in assisting the
government to define the critical path for achieving key reforms and outcomes contained in
the sectoral strategies; providing or mobilizing technical assistance to develop technical
options; focusing the attention o f the needed stakeholders; and establishing a timeframe for
the reform process.       Given the dynamism created in the Bulgarian economy and its
institutions as a result o f accession, the DPL series has been designed with added flexibility in
phases two and three to accommodate to the GOB needs ina rapidly changing environment.

RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS INBULGARIA
7.        Over the last eight years, Bulgaria has made impressive progress towards long-
term stability and sustained growth. Following a difficult transition which culminated in a
severe crisis in 1996-97, macroeconomic stability was reestablished and has been maintained
by prudent fiscal policies and strict discipline in incomes policy anchored in the Currency
Board Arrangement (CBA) adopted in 1997. Fiscal consolidation reduced the overall fiscal
deficit from 15.2 percent o f GDP in 1996 to a balanced budget in2003 and generated a fiscal
surplus in2004 (1.8 percent o f GDP) and 2005 (2.3 percent). The external and public debt to
GDP ratios declined from nearly 100 and 107.4 percent o f GDP respectively in 1997 to about
68 and 32 percent respectively in 2005. As a result o f these policies and deep structural
reforms, average growth reached the levels o f the eight EUNew Member States (NMS-8)at
about 5 percent per year in 2000-05 (estimated at 5.6 percent in 2005) and inflation has
declined to single digits from hyperinflation levels. Unemployment also declined from 18
percent in 2000 to 10.7 percent by end-2005, but masks a continued low labor market
participation rate.

8.       A broad structural reform agenda has contributed to solid economic
performance. The severity o f the 1996-97 crisis and the prospect of EU accession changed
the political economy in the direction o f reforms. Between 1998 and 2002, most o f the non-
infrastructure enterprises and banks were privatized or liquidated, trade and prices were
liberalized, energy reforms made important progress, and the first steps were taken in
regulatory reform to improve the investment climate. As a result, growth is ledby the private
sector which now accounts for two-thirds o f total gross value added with an equal share of
total employment.        Integration with external markets expanded with trade in goods and
services increasing relative to GDP from 94 percent in 1998 to almost 140 percent in 2005.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows increased during the period, but remained broadly
constant as a share o f total investment.           Investor confidence improved over time - both
domestically and externally. Bulgaria's long-term foreign currency debt was upgraded to an
investment grade rating inthe summer o f 2004.

9.       However the external position has remained under pressure, with the external
current account deficit continuing to widen. The external current account deficit at 11.8
percent o f GDP in 2005 almost doubled compared to 2004 and i s deteriorating further in the
first half o f 2006. Strong private demand for consumption and investment goods and record
highoil prices have contributed to substantial increase inmerchandise imports of almost 10
percentage points o f GDP in 2005 compared to 2004. Export performance in 2005 was
affected adversely by summer floods but data for the first half o f 2006 suggest that the
recovery is already under way. FDIinflows remained strong and covered most o f the current
account deficit despite the lack o f large privatization deals in 2005. Gross official reserves
continued to provide ample coverage o f imports o f goods and services. This has allowed
early repayment on the remaining Brady bonds and prepayment o f debt to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Thus, external public debt was reduced to below
20 percent o f GDP by May 2006 and i s currently with an improved currency and interest

  All macroeconomic data and projections in the Program Document are as of October 24, 2006 and do not
reflect follow-up updates or revisions based on the Bulgaria's Convergence Programme, 2006-2009 (December
2006) or the State Budget Law (State Gazette No 108 ofDecember 29,2006).

structure. At the same time, private sector external indebtedness is growing rapidly to finance
larger stock of FDIs and strongbank lending. An analysis of macroprudential indicators used
to predict crises suggests that "Bulgaria i s not at present crisis prone"2 although important
risks and vulnerabilities exist and continued careful monitoring is required.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

 10.     The medium term macroeconomic framework centered on the CBA i s expected
to support rapid and sustainable economic growth inthe first years of EU accession and
prepare Bulgaria for monetary integration soon thereafter. The medium term outlook
envisages a robust growth o f 6 percent per annum, a gradual narrowing of the external current
account deficit, and a reduction in debt to GDP ratios.           Growth would be driven by a
continuous rise in investment and improved export performance in line with the recovery in
external demand from the EU and the increased competitiveness o f Bulgarian goods on
international markets. Consistent with the planned upgrades inthe infrastructure sectors and
early EUmembership, investment i s likely to grow at a higher speed and exceed 31percent o f
GDP in 2009. Inflation is projected to decline to 3.5 percent in 2008-2009 which would
support Bulgaria's meeting the criteria for entering the euro zone. External current account
deficit i s projected to remain highreflecting catch-up effects but would be gradually declining
from estimated 12.4 percent in 2006 to 9.8 percent in 2009. FDI inflows are expected to
continue to be the primary source o f balance o f payments financing provided that the
remainingstructural and institutional impediments are addressed, including weaknesses inthe
business climate, public administration, and the judicial system.            Gross external debt i s
projected to decline gradually to 67 percent o f GDP by 2009 from estimated 69 percent at end
2006.

11.      The current course of fiscal policy i s            basically appropriate to ensure
macroeconomic stability, growth and poverty reduction in the medium term.                        The
Government is committed to continue runningoverall fiscal surpluses in 2007-2009 although
on a declining trend. In the face o f deteriorating external account deficit, the Government
decided to increase the expected budget surplus in2006 to at least 3 percent of GDP. To this
effect, the Government agreed with the Fund to save 50 percent of the expected revenue
overperformance and refrain from spending 7 percent o f discretionary expenditure.                 In
addition, substantial downsizing o f the state administration has already begun with close to
4,000 positions cut since the beginning of 2006 while further 1,400 positions planned for
closure by the end o f 2006. Planned surplus for 2007 i s 2 percent of GDP, which i s projected
to decline to less than one percent by 2009.

12.     The main fiscal challenge in the medium term will be to absorb the expected
sharp increase intransfers from the EUby consolidatingand increasingthe efficiency of
existing expenditures.       The net overall financial effect o f expected EU grant funds is
projected to be highly positive on Bulgaria, about 3.7 percent o f annual GDP on average
during2007-2009, ifthe country takes all the available funds. A large share o fthese funds is
expected to go to support education initiatives, upgrading o f roads, implementation o f the
European common agriculture policy, and environmental standards. If the Government
absorbed all the available funds, the fiscal position would deteriorate by about 2 percent of
GDP3. Taking into account the already highlevel o f public spending, and the need to contain
domestic demand, the Government decided to cap the level of public expenditures as a share
o f GDP at 40 percent and substitute existing expenditures with EUfunds.

 Bulgaria: Public Finance Policy Review, Leveraging EUFundsfor Productivity and Growth, February 2006,
the World Bank.

                                                                                                   11

13.      Improving the allocation of public expenditure requires creating a more efficient
and transparent expenditure management system with enough flexibility to adjust
quickly and efficiently to macroeconomic shocks. The central key pressure points on the
fiscal position are in health care, education, and the social protection system. The Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) for Bulgaria4demonstrated the need to improve
allocations to address the issues o f overcapacity in health and education and to improve the
targeting o f social protection programs, which constitute about one-third o f total public
spending. Although important steps have been taken since 2002, particularly to improve the
financial position of the pension system, to improve the targeting o f social assistance, and to
address issues o f overcapacity in health care, the agenda is still unfinished while the ageing
population andrisinghealth care costs pose continuous challenges.

14.      Medium-term risks and gradual progress towards monetary integration, weigh
heavily on the fiscal stance. Inthe context o f the domestic environment, there are the risks
o f the loss o f momentum in the implementation o f structural reforms and the weakening of
macroeconomic discipline. Pressures to increase spending associated with EU accession
without corresponding expenditure saving or substitution may lead to relaxation o f fiscal
policy which would further increase domestic demand pressures and their impact on external
imbalances and inflation. The economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including
further increases in oil prices and interest rate increases, and greater capital flow volatility or
the falling short of FDI flows from the levels needed to finance the large external current
account deficit.       Furthermore, the gradual progress towards monetary integration raises
additional macroeconomic challenges. Greater monetary integration has potential benefits,
butitis notwithout risks given the large structural differences betweenBulgaria and countries
in the Eurozone. The preparation for, and eventual adoption of, the Euro will increase the
need for deeper economic restructuring, inaddition to enhanced macro-financial discipline, to
ensure adherence to the conditions for participation inthe currency area.

15. Given the constraints of the CBA, labor market policies are another important
component of the broad policy reform agenda. Ensuringflexibility of labor market i s key
for reallocating labor from low to higher productivity activities.           Thus, the economy can
flexibly adjust to shocks and the competitiveness o f Bulgarian companies would be
substantially improved. By supporting policies to achieve increased flexibility in the labor
markets the D P Lprogram will contribute to this objective.

16.      Deeper economic restructuring i s needed to address risks and vulnerabilities and
to achieve successful integration with EU and global markets.                  Despite the positive
developments over the last eight years interms of macroeconomic stability and advancement
with structural reforms, important gaps inreforms and performance remain relative to the EU
New Members States. Despite a well diversified trade partnership and a liberal trade regime
which provides Bulgarian producers with easy access to global markets, its economy has yet
to benefit more hlly from its integrationwith the EUand external markets. Bulgaria's export
capacity remains limited compared to the NMS-8 countries. Competitiveness remains mostly
limited to unskilled labor-intensive and energy-intensive activities. This can be explained by

17.         The following core reform agenda, supported by macroeconomic policies that
address risks and vulnerabilities, would help accelerate Bulgaria's convergence to the
EU income levels: (i)              improving the quantity and quality o f physical and human capital
accumulation, by focusing on upgrading skills and the transport network, and improving
efficiency and transparency inpublic administration; (ii)                         enhancing labor market adjustment
and the creation o f employment by implementing labor market reforms that better balance
labor adjustment, the creation o f employment, and unemployment risks, and include the
rationalization o f the social protection system to enable the reduction of payroll taxes; and
(iii)implementing institutional reforms intwo areas-reducing                                  legislative and regulatory
complexity in order to improve competition in the domestic market, and moving toward a
rules-based system by implementing judicial reform to increase reliance o f economic
transactions on contracts andtheir efficient enforcement.

18.        The IMF has completed the third review of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in
August 2006. A precautionary 25-months SBA with access of SDRlOOmillion was approved
by the IMF Board on August 6, 2004, and the first review was completed on May 18, 2005,
and the second in April 2006.                  The SBA-supported program seeks to reduce Bulgaria's
increased external vulnerability and to achieve sustainable highgrowth through: (i)                               continued
tight fiscal policy and measures to reduce bank liquidity inorder to reduce excess demand in
the short run; and (ii)            structural reforms to boost output and export capacity and export
capacity in the medium-term. At completion o f the third review and in light o f Bulgaria's
continued high external vulnerability, the IMF and GOBdecided to extend the SBA by 6
months beyond September 2006 to continue monitoring program implementation by end-

                                                                                                                            13

2006, and complete the reporting to the IMF Board by end-March 2007. Once Bulgaria joins
the EU, its participation in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP),'                         with related
multilateral surveillance, would help to sustain Bulgaria's prudent macroeconomic policies.

19.       The DPL series is broadly consistent with the Medium T e r m Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). The MTEF calls for a proportion o f spending on health as percentage
o f GDP that will remain relatively flat and fluctuate between 4.3 and 4.4 percent. Likewise,
the spending on education i s projected to fluctuate between 4.2 and 4.4 percent o f GDP.
Some o f the reform measures supported by the D P L series will have a fiscal impact, as
discussed in the respective section, but overall the entire program should be neutral in the
medium term. This should be the case as the savings generated by some o f the reforms-e.g.
the change inthe financing mechanism for schools-is                used to finance quality and efficiency
improvements-e.g.         renovation o f schools to accommodate larger number o f students.

POVERTYAND THE SOCIAL SECTORS

20.       The continued growth since the 1996-97 economic crisis has led to improvements
inliving standards, although deep pockets ofpoverty persist. Per capitaincome increased
from US$1,200 in 1997 to US$2,740 in 2004. Nevertheless, per capita GDP remained at 30
percent o f EU average (in2003 PPP terms), which makes continued growth and convergence
o f living standards towards EU standards a core policy goal. As incomes in Bulgaria have
risen, poverty has fallen. Poverty, measured at two-thirds o f average per capita consumption
in 1997, fell sharply fkom 36 percent in1997to 12.8 percent in2001. The depth and severity
o f poverty also improved. The most recent poverty assessment prepared in 2003 showed a
further reduction o f poverty, including reduction o f extreme poverty and eradication o f food
poverty (a proxy for malnutrition). As poverty has fallen, the nature o f poverty has evolved
with poverty becoming increasingly concentrated among vulnerable groups. Box 1 shows
that household size, number o f children, education or occupation o f the head o f household,
gender, ethnicity and location are the key determinants o fhousehold welfare andpoverty.




  The main objective of the SGP is to enforce discipline in the Euro-zone as a means to support price stability
and sustainable growth. Budgetary discipline is gauged with respect to two criteria: a general government
deficit-to-GDP ratio below three percent, and a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent. Functioning of the SGP
rests on two pillars: multilateral surveillance and corrective mechanisms. As regards surveillance, EUmember
states are required to prepare a Convergence Program and update it annually. The EC prepares an assessmentof
such convergence programs on the basis o f which the Council of the EU issues an opinion. As regards
corrective mechanisms, the Excessive Deficit Procedure identifies and forces corrections of excessive deficits,
definedunder non-exceptional circumstances as a deficit over three percent ofGDP.

                                                                                                            14

 Box 1: Who are the Poor?

  Thepoor are more likely to befound outsideSofia. The poverty rate inrural areas was estimated at 29.1 percent in2003, comparedto
  18.7 percent inurbanareas. Welfare differences by location,however, become sharper when Sofia city is compared to other - urbanor
 rural- areas. Eventaking into accountthe differences inthe characteristics(suchas education, family size, etc.) betweenrural andurban
  households,the per capita consumption of households living outside Sofia ranges is 10-25percent lower thanthat for householdsliving
  inthe capitalcity.

 People living in large households with two or more children are more likely to bepoor. Only a fifth of the populationlive inhouseholds
 with five or more members, but they account for about 41 percent of the poor. People living inhouseholds with two or more children
  accountfor over athird of the poor.

 A strong correlate ofpoverty is ethnicity. Romahouseholdsaccount for about 6 percentofthe populationaccording to the survey, but for
  over a fifthof the poor. Per capita consumptionina Romahouseholdis only halfofthe consumptionof a similar householdof Bulgarian
  origin.

 Human capital is a strongpolicy leverfor reducingpoverty. Over two-thirds of the poor consist of people living in householdswhere
 the head has less than high-school education. Per capita consumption i s 30-35 percent higher in households where the head has
  completed high school or technical education and 45 percent higher when the head has completed university studies (relative to a
 householdwherethe headhasonly completedprimaly education).

 Private entrepreneurs and employed individuals are relatively protected from poverty. The poverty rate is significantly lower in
 households headedby employers, self-employed or employees, while the risk of poverty is twice as high inhouseholds headedby the
 unemployedandinactive(other thanpensioners)comparedto the rest of the population.

 Poverty is not gender neutral. The risk of poverty i s slightly higher inhouseholdsheadedby women, usually singleparenthouseholds.
 Whendifferences ineducation, locationandother characteristicsare taken into account,per capitaconsumption inthese householdsis 10
 percent lowerthan inthose headedby men.

21.         A simulation of the poverty headcount index up to 2005 also indicates further
reduction inpoverty. Since recent data on poverty i s unavailable, a simulation exercise was
performed using the 2001 poverty rate o f 12.8 percent and annual household consumption
data, using the notion o f growth elasticity o f poverty which measures the change inpoverty
for a given change in growth.6 Table 1 shows the simulated poverty rates for different
elasticity assumptions. Inall cases poverty would have decreased from the 2001 values.

 22.         Bulgaria i s on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). After
 2000, improvements are more pronounced in school enrollments and smaller with respect to
 health indicators.                It is important that improvements include gains among the most
 disadvantaged, as gaps in access to health care and education appear to be narrowing.
 However gaps in Bulgarian attendance rates in primary and secondary education are still
  among the highest in the ECA region. As with education, financial constraints (formal and
 informal out-of-pocket costs) and differences in quality o f services accessed are in part
 responsible for lower health outcomes among poor and disadvantaged groups. Minorities,
 Roma in particular, are more likely to fall through the cracks o f the education and health
 systems with their lower access compounded by social exclusion.

                                               111.    MAINSECTOR ISSUES

 HEALTH
 23.        Health service provision i s inefficient, access to care less than universal, and the
 National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)i s not financially sustainable. The reform that
 introduced health insurance in Bulgaria was meant to achieve universal coverage in a
 financially sustainable manner, while promoting the efficient use o f resources and improving
 quality.       Eight years after the passing o f the health insurance law, health outcomes are
 beginning to show a reversion in the negative trend observed during the 199Os, but it i s also
 becoming apparent that many aspects o f the original plan require additional fine-tuning and
 that some o f the main reforms are yet to be completed. In Bulgaria problems remain in the
 following areas:


                                                                                                                              16

.   Current spending i s biased towards more expensive inpatient care, and the current
    payment and monitoring systems for hospitals do not contribute to managing the growth
    o fpublic spending adequately;
    The excess capacity o f hospitals and unequal allocation o f resources across regions has
    not been addressed;
    Spending on pharmaceuticals, at 80 Euro per capita - o f which about 50% is out-off-
    pocket-     i s still low in comparison to other European countries but i s increasing and has
    the potential to become a major burden for the NHIF budget and limit access to basic
    drugs for poor households; and
    Access to health care services i s not universal

24.     Spending in health may become unsustainable as the NHIF assumes its role of
single purchaser of health services. The NHIF was created with the expectation that it
would become the sole financier o f the majority o f health care services.                      The transition
towards this has been slower than expected. In 2005 NHIF purchased services in hospitals
representing about 50 percent o f their budget. Having both the Ministryof Health (MoH) and
NHIF purchase inpatient care services with different payment mechanisms sends confusing
signals to providers and promotes strategic behavior on their part, duplicates administrative
costs, and prevents NHIF from fulfilling its role o f strategic purchaser. In addition, neither
payment mechanism -as             they are currently administered and monitored-                  provides an
incentive for providers to contain spending and at present do not really reflect hospitals'
operating costs.

25.     Since about 50 percent o f public spending on health goes to hospitals, any long term
plan to control spending should address that sector.                   A recent study on the financial
sustainability o f the NHIF estimated that in 2006 the deficit could exceed 25 percent o f total
revenues, and that if nothing changes the deficit could climb to 47 percent in 2007. On the
revenue side, there i s an accumulated debt from 1.7 million non-contributors in2004 who had
not paid for a period ranging from 3 to 36 months, with an accumulated debt o f BGN 300
million approximately. The hospital sector currently has a stock o f arrears o f BGN 67Mn or
about 6 percent o f NHIF spending (December 2005). Although a small number compared to
other European countries, the increasing trend over time reflects a structural problem that
couldbecome serious inthe future.7

26.     Traditional efficiency indicators on inpatient care show progress but the
fundamental problem of excessive infrastructure prevails. Most countries inEurope have
faced the problem o f excessive hospital infrastructure and adopted measures to consolidate
inpatient care into fewer hospitals and to reduce the lengths o f stay at hospitals as a way to
curtail spending. Bulgaria has reduced the number o f beds but evidence suggests that more
could be done. Pilot studies in the Gabrovo, Lovech, Stara Zagora, and Razgrad regions to
evaluate the functioning o f hospitals and assess the extent by which there could be excess
capacity inthe sector found that (i)       there is excess capacity in all the regions analyzed; (ii)          in
some cases there i s excessive utilization o f hospitals due to the lack o f alternative facilities
that could address some o f the more simple conditions at a lower price; (iii)                some hospitals
perform social functions, like taking care o f terminal patients, and long term medical care;


 For example in Slovakia the annual flow of new debt the health sector was approximately S K K 5 billion in
2003, equivalent to 42 percent of total spending by the health insurance funds. The situation i s similar in other
New Member States like Hungary and Lithuania.

                                                                                                               17

(iv) distortions inhospital practices are frequent, like discharging and re-admitting patients in
order to be paidtwice andcode-creeping inorder to matchmore expensive payment codes. In
the case o f Stara Zagora for example, the pilot study estimated that the number o f reported
discharges was about 76 percent higher than the theoretical estimate based on population
needs. In addition it estimated that the theoretical number o f discharges could be handled
with 910 beds instead o fthe current 1,973.

27.        Pharmaceuticalpolicy inBulgaria i s under similar constraints as in other
countries of the region. The mainproblems inthe pharmaceuticalsector are:

i.EventhoughspendingonpharmaceuticalsisnothighforEuropeanstandards,ithasbeen
      growing at an accelerating rate.
ii.Thereareinefficienciesinthesystem,suchasspendingforexpensivedrugswithlimited
      value, delayed listingo f generics anduncontrolled hospital drug spending.
iii.Access tomedicinesisnegativelyaffectedbyhighco-payments for severaldrugsthat
     belong to a basic package o f healthcare in other countries with similar demography and
      economic conditions as Bulgaria. Most drugs in Bulgaria are only reimbursed to 25
     percent o fthe price consumers paid.
iv. Current procedures for drug pricing and including new drugs on the positive list are
      extremely bureaucratic and not inline with EUregulations. (see Box 3)

28.         As a "rule o f thumb", drug expenditure has a "natural growth rate" inmiddle-income
countries at about twice the rate o f GDP, even if expenditures are managed well. This is due
to several factors, such as an aging population with higher prevalence o f chronic diseases;
medical progress, offering new break-through treatment options that become immediately
essential; and individual prioritization o f needs, making better healthcare a priority over other
consumption choices for citizens that move up into the economic "middle class".                                                         The
challenge then i s not to reduce expenses in drugs but to control their growth rate and make
basic drugs affordable to every household, ina financial sustainable manner.

Box 3: ReimbursingdrugsinBulgaria

Proton-PumpInhibitors (PPI) are amodemtreatmentfor duodenalulcer andreflux disease-frequent conditionsseen inday-to-day
gastro-enterologicalpractice. InBulgaria,three different proton-pump-inhibitorsare onthe reimbursementlist: Drugs A, B, andC
(Brandnames havebeenexcluded from the document). All three are equally effectiveand safe: (www.drundinest.org, "Most
comparative clinical studies between the drugs in this class have shown that all PPIs are comparably effective for treating acid-
related gastrointestinal disorders, including GERD.Since all PPIs are similarly effective, the choice of which PPI to use will typically
depend onyour doctor'spreference and/or yourprescription benefitsformulary. ") However, as only drug A i s available as ageneric
inBulgaria,the costs to NHIFandto thepatient varydramatically(see Table). Dosagesaresimilar for similar indications, but evenif
twice the dosage of drugA would berequired,the cost advantageremains significant. Ifonly drugA would bereimbursed,NHIF
mightbeableto increasethe reimbursementrateandthereby improveaccess for poorerpatients.

29.        Low income groups have limited access to health care.                                             A household survey
conducted in 2002 to determine the true cost o f health care for households gathered
information about informal payments, utilization, and health spending by households of
different socioeconomic and ethnic background. The results suggest problems with access for
low income groups and in some cases the presence o f informal or unregulated payments in

                                                                                                                                         18

order to receive care. According to the survey approximately 13 percent o f households did
not approach their general practitioner (GP) because they could not afford to pay for the
expenses associated with the examination, and 29 percent o f those referred to a specialist by a
GP did not consult them for the same reason. Financial reasons are quoted by 90 percent o f
Roma and about 50 percent o f Bulgarians as the main reason for not seeking admittance to
inpatient care. Finally, access to pharmaceuticals i s also a problem: about 11 percent o f
households did not purchase medicines that had been prescribed by a doctor (25.7 percent in
the case o f Roma).


EDUCATION
30.     Bulgaria appears to be facing a decline inthe quality of education and a national
system for quality assessment i s still lacking. The information on quality o f education in
Bulgaria i s sparse, but there are some solid indicators suggesting that it has not improved over
the last decade. For instance, in the area o f mathematics, Bulgarian eight-graders participated
in three rounds of an international study (i.e., the Trends in International Mathematics and
Sciences Study (TIMSS)) in 1995, 1999 and 2003. Of all the countries in the sample,
Bulgarian eighth grade students faced the steepest decline in mathematics and science
achievement. While it could be argued that the curriculum reform implemented just during
those years partly explains such results, the magnitude o f the decline clearly points to a
worrying quality drop in lower secondary schools in Bulgaria. Moreover, too many students
still drop out without completing secondary education: over one-fifth of youth leave school
with only lower secondary compared to 7.5 percent inthe NMS. And the quality o f learning
results i s also unequally distributed among the student population. Recent external evaluations
o f 4th graders done by the Open Society Institute concluded that the average student in the
"Roma schools" in the sample had not even mastered half o f the curricula taught, and this
performance fell short o f their peers in non-Roma schools.* In such a challenging context,
Bulgaria has lacked a national system for the monitoring o f student performance and the
overall assessment o f education quality. This i s further aggravated with the absence o f
Bulgaria from international quality assessment test initiatives on a consistent basis like PISA
(Program for International Student Assessment) and PIRLS (Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study).

31.     In addition Bulgaria does not have the institutionalcapacity to assess the impact
of reforms on the quality of education. Currently, the Ministry o f Education and Science
(MES) determines quality standards and the core curriculum, and 28 regional inspectorates o f
the MES monitor schools' compliance with education legislation. This monitoring process
collects basic indicators such as participation and attainment in a decentralized fashion, but
this data is not being used effectively to manage the system. Today it is not possible to
supervise quality systematically, rewarding or cautioning schools according to performance,
or targeting measures to improve the quality o f teaching where they are needed. Further,
municipalities are largely incharge o f school management and capital expenditure -without a
strongregime to hold them accountable for delivering quality.



* Inthe sample, the "Roma schools" were not identified as such. However, in conversations with the municipal
education teams incharge of the schools which were tested, we learnt that the poorest performing schools were
schools where there were more than 70% Roma students.

                                                                                                          19

32.       Net enrollment rates are lower than desired, and participation varies by ethnic
and socioeconomic status.               Participation rates among the school age population have
increased over the last decade (Table 2). Net enrollment ratios at pre-primary, basic andupper
secondary levels are all higher today than they were 10 years ago. Nevertheless the net
enrollment ratio in lower secondary education - at 84 percent - i s still low, and gains in
participation at this level have slowed down in the last five years.' The sharp fall in net
enrollment rates between primary and lower secondary, still a part o f compulsory education,
i s o f concern. Upper secondary shows impressive increases, although to some extent this
reflects the recent increase in the duration o f some programs."                   The low participation rate
affects mostly the poor and vulnerable, many o f whom fail to complete compulsory education.

33.       Bulgaria is          experiencing a demographic transition, with the school-age
population shrinking substantially. However, a generous education infrastructure
remains from before the transition, and the current financing regime locks in
inefficiencies. As Figure 3 shows, student numbers declined by more than 25 percent in the
period 1992 to 2005. Municipalities have been closing down schools in recent years in
response to this decline, but there has not been a systematic planto adapt to this demographic
transition. Therefore, a large infrastructure overhang remains and grows, leading to declining
student-teacher ratios and growing per student costs. There are a large number o f schools that
operate with very low student-teacher ratios; about 31 percent o f municipal schools operate
with ratios below 11 -both             inrural and urbanareas. Inaddition, the stock ofnon-teaching
personnel reflects recruitment practices from before Bulgaria's political and demographic
transition, which did not necessarily follow cost-effectiveness considerations. In Bulgaria's
schools there are currently 43 non-teaching staff for every 100teachers.l1



  Age enrollments, defined as participation o f the relevant age group independently o f the educational level are
higher, however and close to universal, suggesting that a significant fraction o f the lower secondary age group
may still be inprimary education, while others may have progressed to upper secondary.
lo  The duration o f several (but not all) upper secondary programs was increased by one year to 5 years in
2002/03, while the denominator refers to a four year age cohort. Nevertheless, absolute enrollments also
increasedby about 14% between2000101 and 2003104, despite the fall inthe population age cohort.
11 The data quoted here on "non-teaching staff' are data from the Annual Census o f School from the National
Statistical Institute. However, school visits across the country suggest that these numbers do not always include
all the non-teaching staff which is associated with the schools. Often, school principals who fill out the surveys
have excluded security staff or cafeteria personnel if these staff members are paid by the municipality andor
outsourced to a private fm.Insome instances, schools visited by the World Bankteam inthe outskirts o f Sofia

34.       The current financing mechanism i s not creating incentives for an efficient
management of resources. This problem i s twofold: resource allocation i s centralized and
financing i s input-based. First, as resource allocation to schools i s determined at the central
level, schools or local authorities cannot react to local demands and flexibly meet the needs of
students and parents. Second, salary expenditure i s tied to the number o f teachers and non-
teaching staff, which inturn i s determined by detailed MES regulations. Inother words, local
authorities' freedom to adjust human and capital resources i s limited, and at the same time,
financial incentives encourage them to keep the current inefficient student-teacher ratio.

35.       The optimization o f the school network could save substantial amounts of money even
ifit focusedpurely onthe largemunicipalities where distancesbetweenschools are small. For
instance, there are 667 municipality schools located in "urban"                         areas within large
municipalities (Le. with a population greater or equal to 60,000).'* Out o f these schools, only
320 operate with student-teacher ratios greater than or equal to 14.


SOCIAL PROTECTION
36.       On the verge of acceding to the EuropeanUnion, a major challenge for Bulgaria
i s the low labor force participation and employment rate. In spite o f having increased
from 50 percent in the beginning o f 2003 to 59 percent in mid-2006, the employment rate
remains low compared to the EU-15 and most new EUmember states and substantially below
the EU Lisbon target rate of 70 percent by 2010, as can be seen inFigure 4.13 At present, 68

had 4 security guards, guarding tiny school buildings on a %-hour basis. In one instance, in the Village of
Marchevo the expenditure on the security guards exceeded the expenditures on teachers' wages.
l2 There are 29 municipalities (out of 264) which have a population greater than 60,000.
l3 All figures applyto age 15-64.

                                                                                                        21

percent o fthe employment is created by the private sector but a sizable share of it i s tied up in
low productivity jobs in agriculture, forestry and services, much of it in informal activities.
Accelerated efforts are necessary to meet the target intime. Despite the growth o f the private
sector, attracting andretainingpeople inemployment will be difficult given that 35 percent o f
the population aged 15-64 remains economically inactive, the workforce i s aging and the
demographic decline sets limitations for its renewal.

37.       Despite the positive trends in employment, the problem of non-employmentand
under-employment in Bulgaria is serious compared to EU countries. The overall
unemployment rate has been reduced substantially fiom 13.7 percent in 2003 to 9 percent in
mid-2006 as a result o f accelerated growth and net employment generation in the private
sector supported by active labor market programs.                                         However unemployment remains
persistent, especially among the youth and the less skilled. The incidence o f long-term
unemployment i s high: 54 percent o f the unemployed are jobless for longer than one year and
21.2 percent are first-time job seekers.

38.       The labor market exhibits high rates of informality. Bulgaria still has one o f the
highest shares of undeclared work among the "old" and new members o f the EU, on the one
hand providing a cushion for workers who cannot find a job inthe formal sector, and on the
other hand entailing a loss in budget revenues. For 2004, the EC estimated the share o f
undeclared work in Bulgaria at 22-30 percent o f GDP compared to 14-15 percent average for
the new EUmember states. Informality points to various bureaucratic and regulatory rigidities
and to limited flexibility of employment which hinder labor market adjustment and job
creation. As shown in Table 3 in comparison to the new member states Bulgaria's labor
market i s more rigid in particular in terms of the difficulty o f hiring workers, reflecting
barriers to hiringworkers on temporary and fix-term contracts.l4

39.       The current design of social assistance does not provide incentives for job
searching. Certain population groups remain reliant on social benefits under the Guaranteed
MinimumIncomeProgram(GMI) for over ten years without being accountable for job search
and improving skills and qualifications. These are mostly low-qualified long-term
unemployed and people without employment history who are not eligible for unemployment
benefits and end up receiving social assistance, which they combine with informal
emp10yment.l~ The overall number o f social assistance beneficiaries i s not very high -
between 220,000 and 230,000 people in 2004-2006; however a significant share o f them -
close to 85 percent - are people of working age, and over 75 percent o f the working age
GMI assistance beneficiaries are registered unemployed.16 The low employment rate is also
associated with the large increase in the number o f recipients o f disability pensions and
benefits.       Compared to 1999, in 2004 the number o f disability pensions due to general
sickness increased by 54 percent. During the same period, the number o f social disability
pensions granted increased 6.7 times while the number o f beneficiaries that only receive a
disability pension declined, as duplication o f entitlements were allowed. Working age
disability pensioners comprise 5 percent o f the working age population and 13.6 percent o f
the economically inactive. The employment o f 50 percent of the disability pensioners could
potentially increase the employed in the economy by 4 percent. Social services provision i s
decentralized and expanding however not yet contributing significantly to employment
throughjob creation inthe social services sector or by enhancing thejob opportunities outside


15By law, unemployment benefits are insurance-based, with duration of maximum 12 months and require
employment and contribution record of minimum9 months inthe last 15 months as qualifying conditions. Long-
term unemployed andpeople with no work history cannot satisfy these conditions.
l6This represents more than 60 percent of the unemployed in the second quarter of 2006 (Labor Force Survey
data)

                                                                                                                               23

it, e.g. for mothers o f pre-school aged children and caregivers through increase inthe access
to affordable childcare, affordable daycare for people with disabilities and long-term care for
the elderly.


                         IV.    THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

40.      The coalition government that took office inAugust 2005 set the goal to prepare new
comprehensive strategies inhealth and education, to be validated by the Council o f Ministers
(CoM) duringthe first halfo f 2006 and approvedby Parliament soon thereafter. The
education strategy was approved by Parliament inJune 2006 while the health strategy i s
currently under discussion at the CoM.

Government's Strategy on Health
41.      The draft health strategy i s built around nine strategic objectives and actions oriented
towards improving health outcomes, increasing efficiency and access, and achieving financial
sustainability. The main strategic objectives are:

         Improving the health o f the population, by increasing citizens' awareness about
         healthy lifestyles andincreasing the focus on prevention;
         Delivering high-quality and guaranteed healthcare services, by improving the
         accreditation system for healthcare establishments and increasing access to healthcare
         services through the reduction o f financial and geographic inequities;
         Emphasizingthe role o f primary outpatient care, by refiningthe payment mechanisms
         and clearly defining the division o f the responsibilities between the primary and the
         outpatient specialized medical services;
         Optimizing the network o f the health care providers, by improving the links between
         outpatient and inpatient care, devising a masterplan and implementation strategy for
         achieving a more efficient hospital network; strengthening hospital management, and
         revisingthe prospect payment system for hospitals;
         Implementing a transparent and fair pharmaceutical policy, by increasing the
         awareness o f patients, controlling prices and rationalizing the drug prescription
         practices and drug therapies usedbyhealthcare professionals;
         Developing the human resources o f the health sector, by aligning medical education
         content and systems to EU standards and improving the qualifications o f health
         managers at different governance levels inthe health system;
         Securing the financial stability and sustainability o f the system in the long-term, by
         promoting the rational use o f pharmaceutical products, creating an efficient and
         effective drug reimbursement policy, refining the models o f primary and specialized
         outpatient healthcare and the restructuring o f inpatient care, improving compliance for
         health insurance contributions, improving the negotiation process for the National
         Framework Contract, increasing the monitoring and enforcement capacity o f the
         NHIF, improving the prospective payment system, developing a voluntary health
         insurance, and introducingregulated co-payments; and
         Applying the European Union's regulations and directives, including the development
         o fprojects to be supported by EUstructural funds.

         To overcome the challenges in the sector the Government has devised a two-prong
strategy, which includes stabilization, short term actions, and structural, medium term

                                                                                                24

reforms. These actions are expected to tackle both supply and demand driven problems. In
addition the Government is considering changes in the prevailing model o f financing and
provision aimed at introducingmore competition inthe health sector.

43.      To stabilize spending the NHIF i s enforcing the collection of revenues and
introducing additional financial controls inhospitals. First and most immediate, the NHIF
i s taking steps to improve revenue collection, for example cross-checking the collection and
service databases with the newly-created National Revenue Agency, who took over the
collection o f health premiums from National Social Security Institute (NSSI).                   A
Memorandum o f Understanding was signed between this institution and the MOH to exert
more control on large firms.      Since then the number o f audits to providers and users has
increased and debt collection on contributions by large companies has improved. According
to NHIF these actions have resulted in an increase in collections o f about BGN 20 million in
the first half o f 2006. Second, inorder to keep better control and monitoring on spending by
providers NHIF i s requiring all providers to report their spending electronically. Third, to
prevent strategic behavior on the part o f hospitals NHIF is becoming the single payer o f
hospital services inthe country (with some minor exceptions). Unifyingmost health spending
under NHIF would have the advantage o f reducing strategic behavior on the side of
providers-which      tends to increase spending; reducing administrative costs; and increasing
the bargaining power o f NHIF. Fourth, the MOH has signed recovery plans with all the
hospitals where the MOH is the majority stakeholder. These plans contain provisions for the
hospitals to maintain a certain financial position, collect unpaid debt, and keep spending
below hospital revenues.         Hospital directors have been made accountable for the
implementation o f these plans, which are already showing a decrease in the stock o f hospital
debts relative to 2005.

44.     The NHIF is also planning to introduce changes to the National Framework Contract,
which sets the prices o f health services and i s negotiated annually with the Bulgarian Medical
Association and the National Association o f Dentists. The main change i s to introduce
volume ceilings for hospital services.     The experience in many European countries and
Canada shows that setting prices is not enough to limit spending by health care facilities, as
they can control volume o f services and recover any reduction in prices by increasing
admission rates. Manycountries inEurope have introduced limits inbothprice and quantities
o f services provided by hospitals, and NHIF i s planningto introduce a similar policy, either
through an amendment to the health insurance law, or the inclusion o f such provision in the
draft budget law for 2007.

45.     On the supply side, the Government is planningto restructure the hospital sector
to adapt it to the current practices of health service provision that rely more and more
on outpatient, less expensive care. Optimizing the hospitals network is a difficult political
issue and therefore it requires building consensus first by collecting evidence and
communicating it to the public and major stakeholders. The government has decided that the
first step in this process will be to implement a hospital masterplan to assess the needs o f the
population and compare them to actual services provided. There have been some successful
experiences with the restructuring o f hospitals that followed this path, like the case of Estonia,
where a restructuring plan was set up in 2000 with the goal o f reducing the number of
hospitals from 78 to 21 by 2015. Usingdemographic and epidemiological models the demand
for health care was estimated, as well as optimal catchment areas by type o f facility, so that
for a given catchment area the maximum time limit to reach the hospital would be one hour.

                                                                                               25

Based on these criteria Estonia identified 3 regional hospitals for tertiary care, 4 central
hospitals, 11 country hospitals, and 3 smaller hospitals. Between 1993 and 2001 the number
o f hospitals went from 115 to 67, the number o f beds decreased from 14,000 to 9,000, and
average length o f stay moved from 15 to 8.7 days.

46.       The hospital masterplanning exercise will not only propose a new, more streamlined
network o f hospitals. It will also estimate their ideal location, the type o f services that should
be provided at each level, the organizational model for better management and accountability,
the costs necessary to implement the network optimization program, and recommend
alternative models to achieve a successful restructuring. It will also propose ways in which
the private sector can participate inthe restructuring and functioning o f hospitals, like Public-
Private-Partnerships. Even though the entire process can last a decade, the Government i s
planning to start implementing the restructuring plan within the next three years, and is
looking into other countries experience within the EUinorder to take advantage o f Structural
Fundsto finance part ofthe process.

47.       The government will improve its co-payment policy in order to limit unnecessary
demand for health care without restricting access to basic services. Currently there seems
to be a significant portion o f health expenditures paid in cash by the users. The amount o f
these payments i s not clearly defined, irrespective o f the efforts o f the National Statistical
Institute (NSI) to monitor health expenditures as one o f the components o f the expenditures
done by households. Based on survey data concerning health care expenditures made in cash
by households, recent estimates put these expenditures at BGN 38 (approx. EUR 20) per
person each year for the 3000 households included in the survey sample. Extrapolating the
sample results, this would mean about BGN 311-350 million per year o f cash payments
(around EUR 160 milli~n).'~            Other estimates place out o f pocket payments at 25 percent of
the total health care expenditures in the country, representing an additional 1.5 percent of
GDP.

48.       The current co-payment structure has to be reviewed in light o f two potentially
contradictory facts: first, as discussed inthe previous section, out o f pocket payments -many
o f which are co-payments-            are creating a barrier to access for some groups. Second, there
seems to be evidence o f unnecessary demand for some services like hospitals. One o f the
goals o f universal health insurance i s to protect individuals from large negative shocks to their
health, covering catastrophic or large health related payments. At the same time unnecessary
demand for services should be limited by introducing adequate co-payments.                                          The
government will undertake a thorough review o f the current structure o f co-payments and the
extent o f unregulated or informal payments and take the necessary actions to limit the
negative effects o f co-payments and unregulatedpayments on access.l8

l8 According to the HealthInsurance Law, every visit to the GP, the specialist (witha referral) or the dentist the
insuredpatients pay a user fee equal to 1% of the MinimumSalary (currently minimumsalary is BGN
160/month, e.g. fee is BGN 1.6). Every day o f hospital stay is paidat 2% o fthe Minimum Salary. Ifthe
insuredperson is hospitalized for more than 10 days ina given calendar year, the person is only paying user fee
for the first 10 days o fhidher stay. User fees are NOT paidby a number o fgroups, includingbut not limited to:
chddren up to 18, pregnant women, people insocial homes and orphanages, conscript military, people on social
assistance, etc. (including also medical school graduates too, just as one curious example...). When lab tests are
being conducted at the referral o f the GP, specialist or dentist, the patient pays at the lab a fee for collection o f

                                                                                                                       26

49.       The government planon pharmaceuticals seeks to secure the financial sustainability o f
drug spending byNHIF, sustain the role o fNHIF as the relevant payer for basic healthcare in
Bulgaria, andbringthe regulatory framework inline with EUregulations. The Government i s
proposing changes in the legislation that will increase the share o f generic prescriptions and
protect NHIF against economically inefficient prescribing behavior by introducing
reimbursement ceilings for therapeutic groups covering chemically similar (rather than
identical) drugs with equivalent therapeutic value. The law addresses technical (for example
registration, manufacturing, clinical research), administrative (such as licensing o fbusinesses)
and economic aspects (pricing, reimbursement) and is based on European regulatory
standards. The reimbursement policy has to improve in order to allow households access to
basic drugs but not at the expense o f fiscal sustainability o f NHIF. A more rational
reimbursement policy should satisfy both objectives. Once the law passes second reading (it
has already been approved in general), Bulgaria will have a legislative framework that i s in
line with EUmember states. The draft has been reviewed by Bank and WHO experts and has
been deemed compliant with EU standards.                    It also follows many o f the recommended
policies by the Bank like the adoption o f a generic drug policy. In order to regulate the
implementation o f the law, 26 by-laws (ordinances) need to be developed, as the law itself i s
fairly general incertain areas (for example pricing and reimbursement). The Government has
requested Technical Assistance (TA) from the Bank to assist inthe drafting o f by-laws, which
will define substantial details and procedure^.'^ The following Gantt Chart summarizes the
Government's program inhealth for the next three years andhighlights major milestones:




bio-material, not higher than2 levaper lab visit regardless o f the number o f tests for that visit. Fee for collection
o f material is waived for people with no income, those insocial facilities, inchild orphanages and social care
homes; and auser fee equal to 1%o fthe minsalary. Finally, co-payments for medications for home treatments
entail a complex system o f full or partial reimbursement, based on a Positive Drug List approvedby MoHand a
s ecial Reimbursement List o f NHIF.
"By-laws      are drafted by inter-ministerial expert groups, submitted by M O H and passed by the Council o f
Ministers.

50.      The Government has embarked on a set o f ambitious initiatives reflected in the
"National Program for the Development o f School Education (2006-2015)" approved by
Parliament in June 2006. The program recognizes that the main challenges that the Bulgarian
primary and secondary education system face include (a) a decrease in the quality and
relevance o f skills taught; (b) a decline inparticipation rates, particularly in upper secondary
education; and (c) an ineffective use o f existing resources. The combination o f these
challenges will affect adversely the competitiveness o f Bulgarian school children in the EU
labor market. In order to reverse these negative trends, the Government appreciates that it
needs to increase access to education for all children and strengthening the quality o f the
education process. To achieve these two goals, the program has identified six broad
objectives:

         Orienting school education towards the stimulation o f thinking and independence,
         towards the formation o fpractical skills and towards personality building;
         Establishing an efficient internal assessment system through the wide-scale use of tests
         and introduction o f a system for national standardized external assessment;
         Decreasing the number o f drop-outs and increase enrollment rates for children in the
         compulsory schooling age;
         Strengthen the authority and improving the social status o f the teacher;
         Decentralizing the school network through the gradual introduction o f delegated
         budgets for all schools and providing more flexibility to municipalities to appoint
         school directors; and
         Optimizing the school network by introducing a single standard (per capita) financing
         formula and putting in place a system o f financial incentives for the closure o f
         ineffective schools.

         The MES is implementing a comprehensive national policy on student assessment
and strengthening its institutional capacity for system-wide evaluation of education
achievement and for quality assurance. One key factor inimproving quality o f education i s
to foster critical thinking skills rather than focusing on memorizing facts. Since external
assessment instrumentshave a great potential to influence teachers' behavior inthe classroom
and to promote a result-oriented and learning culture in schools, critical and independent
thinking and learning of functional skills can be enhanced using valid and fair testing
instruments.However, those very goals may be hampered ifexams andtests do not set out to
assess these important skills; or if they are used only for the purposes o f school and teacher
accountability. National tests and examinations, properly used, will provide evidence about
student performance, quality o f schooling, and the impact of specific education reforms on
quality. For instance, a very ambitious curriculum reform has been implemented over the last
decade, and it would be critical to gain evidence on how the new curriculum is faring with
regards to student achievement.

52.      The Centre for Control and Assessment o f the Quality o f Education (CKOKO) is the
national agency which will institutionalize and sustain the goals o f an outcome-oriented
education system. Similar agencies or institutes already exist - under different denominations
andinstitutional modalities - inevery EuropeanUnion country, and they are emergingas one
o f the key responsibilities o f central governments inthe education sector. The Government is
planning to strengthen CKOKO's institutional and technical capacity in order to implement a
series o f testing programs to assess the quality o f education in Bulgaria, thus providing

                                                                                              29

decision makers and education administrators with hard evidence to support policy changes
andreforms inthe sector.

53.      The second pillar for quality improvement i s the promotion and integration of
ICTs in the school curriculum and in training of teachers, directors and inspectors.
Bulgaria lags behind both the EU and the New Member States on access to computers in
schools and use o f ICT ineducation. Only 33 percent o f schools are connected to the internet,
while the EU average i s 80 percent and the NMS average i s 55 percent. In May 2006 the
Council o f Ministers approved an updated action plan for the implementation of the National
Strategy for the Introduction o f Information Technologies in Bulgarian Schools (2005-2007).
The MES is in charge o f drafting the necessary legal amendments, teacher training,
developing e-content and curriculum, while the State Agency o f Information Technology i s
responsible for computerization and network infrastructure.         The Strategy has two broad
components. The first is to increase the quality o f teaching through the development and use
o f internet based teaching and learning aids, training school teachers on the use o f Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) in the education process, providing computers and
connecting all Bulgarian schools to the internet. The second i s to increase access to education
opportunities for disadvantaged social groups through strengthening distance learning
opportunities, developing an educational internet portal and increasing the amount o f online
content available to both students and teachers.

54.      The MES i s undertakinga detailed assessment to identify legislative roadblocks to the
integration o f ICT in the integration process. The changes have included, in the first phase,
the introduction o f basic ICT training from grade 5 and during the second phase will change
legislation to allow, inter alia, the taking o f electronic tests and record keeping o f students'
scores. Duringthe next three years a significant and increasingportion o f capital spending at
the Ministry o f Education will be directed to ICT related activities. The Government has
planned to invest some BGN 141 million for implementing the Education and ICT Strategy
between 2005 and 2007, making it the third largest item in capital spending in the education
budget. In2005 over 40,000 teachers received basic training on the use o f ICT, some 27,000
computers and over 3,000 servers inthe schools and all Bulgarian schools were provided with
internet access.

55.      The most ambitious element of the government's strategy in education i s the
financing and governance reform in municipal schools.               The Government's Program
contains a plan for decentralization and optimization o f the school network based on a three-
pronged strategy: (i)  optimizing the school network via a funding reform that will allocate
money to municipalities by a unified standard per student, for both salary and non-salary
expenditures; (ii) decentralization o f school management to empower schools to manage their
humanresources via delegated budgets, and (iii)    mitigatingmeasures to prevent anincrease in
drop-outs during the reform transition (this i s integrated with the general drop-out reduction
program) *

56.     An agreement has been reached within the Government on the new financing
formula for schools. MOF, the MES and the National Association o f Municipalities (NAM)
have agreed on the definition o f the "unified standard". There will be four centrally set rates,
varying according to population density. Municipalities inmore rural, less densely populated
areas -which    are also poorer in general-    will receive higher per capita funding. During a
transition period o f two years, municipalities losing out under this arrangement will receive

                                                                                               30

the nominally frozen amount o f their 2006 funding. The decision on the new financing
formula will be approved by the Council o f Ministers and submitted to parliament alongside
the Budget Act by 31 October, with effectiveness from January 1, 2007. The rationale behind
letting money follow the student is to set incentives to align infrastructure and staff levels
with current student numbers. Even if "losing" municipalities continue receiving the nominal
2006 allocation, there will still be a mounting financial pressure, as wages are expected to be
increasingby approximately 5-10 percent a year innominal terms. Thus, the only way for the
"losing" municipalities to be financially viable under the per capita scheme i s to consolidate
their school network. Ifthat takes place, the "savings" generated can be invested inextending
and improving the quality o f education services inthe consolidated schools. Fully realizing
the expected outcomes o f the school network optimization would require a timely change in
the primary and secondary education sector legislation.

57.     The Government is going to implement mitigating measures to prevent increases
indrop-out rates and unemployment of school staff as a consequence of the financing
and governance reform. The MES, the MOF, and other key stakeholders in the education
sector agree that optimization o f the school network will not take place without substantial
support, guidance, monitoring and financial incentives from the center. There i s a risk that
instead o f closing schools and re-allocating the freed resources, these may be spread ever
more thinly across existing schools, with detrimental effects for education quality, safety
standards and participation rates. The Government's Strategy therefore envisages financial
stimulisupportingthe efficiency incentive generated bythe fundingreform. A budget line for
`consolidation mitigation' programs has been included inthe 2007 draft budget. The detailed
design o f both the participation agenda and the additional mitigation measures i s currently
under discussion. The counterparts agree that it should contain at least a re-worked transport
program and active outreach to parents, especially to those with children at risk o f dropping
out. Inaddition some o f the active labor market policies could be targeted to school staff, for
example matching their skills and supply with the currently unmet demand in childcare.
Similar schemes have been successful in New York (`Satellite childcare'), and also recently
been adopted by the UK Department o f Work and Pensions (`Support Childminder Network'
and `Childminding under the New Deal').

58.     The Government i s considering additional actions with the objective of reducing
dropout rates. The National Program provides for the following targeted actions, in addition
to any special mitigation measures that will be introduced to reduce the risk o f school
dropouts after the introduction o f the unified standard. First, the practice o f providing free
textbooks and learning aids for students in primary education (grades 1-4) will continue and
should gradually be extended to cover children with special needs. The full operation o f the
Education Portal will assist this process directly by makingelectronic textbooks and learning
aids more widely available. Second, the free school feeding program for students in primary
education will continue, while special efforts are made to restore and return to operation
school canteens inprimary and secondary schools. Third, the provision o f free transportation
to students, combined with the development o f the semi-boarding facilities will continue with
the goal to provide every centrally located school with at least one school bus (minibus) by
2008. Besides the national transport program and outreach to parents the government will
introduce stricter compliance in the linkage o f social benefits to the school attendance o f the
children.



                                                                                              31

59.      The Government's Program also includes a comprehensive deregulation and
decentralization agenda. The aim i s to devolve essential management powers to the local
level through delegated school budgets, school-based management, easing o f class room size
andteacher workload regulations, and a re-structuring o f the powers and tasks o f all involved
institutions. Bulgaria began introducing delegated school budgets inthe late 1990s supported
by a EU commission Phare program.*'                 By 2006, around 40 municipalities (out o f 264) have
some form o f delegated school budgets, in which a formula allocates funds to schools and
principals can manage their budget at the school level. The delegated share i s limited in
practice and the school director has discretion only over all or parts o f the non-staff budget, as
the number o f teaching staff is still determined by MES regulations. The Government plans
to pushfor an extension o f delegated budgets only after the unified standard has been applied,
in2008 and 2009, to provide time for school principals to be trained-an                      Institute for School
Directors i s being set up inNovember 2006-                   and to allow for changes inthe legislation on
centralized staff appointment. Both measures are envisaged inthe Government Program and
should be inplace before budgets are delegated. As a first step in 2007 the MES i s planning
to pilot in 10 municipalities the decentralized appointment of school directors. The following
chart summarizes the Government's plan for the governance and financing reform:




2oA system o f delegated school budgets means that each school receives a lump sum budget for the financial
year. This is a single sum o f money which includes money to pay for the salaries o f teachers and other staff as
well as all the non-staff expenditures, such as utilities, learning materials, school ceremonies, office supplies, and
regular maintenance o f the school building. Under a unified standard per student the school receives a single
lump sum, with no indication as to how much is for salaries and how much for non-salaries. This is up to the
school authorities to decide.

                                                                                                                   32


Government's Strategy on Labor and Social Protection
60.     The Government's program for labor, reflected in the "Employment Strategy
2004-2010" is harmonized with the overarching objectives of the European Employment
Strategy for achieving full employment, quality and good performance at work and an
inclusive labor market. It aims at providing opportunities to each individual in active age
for freely selected and productive employment. The implementation o f the strategy i s
expected to bring about labor force growth o f at least 5 percentage points, permanent
reduction o f unemployment to below 10 percent and participation in active labor market
measures and programs o f at least 25 percent o f the long-term unemployed. The strategy i s
addressing the labor market constraints with a range o f policy instruments, among them: (i)
income policy reform for employment promotion, (ii)active measures to reduce
unemployment and increase labor force participation, (iii)  promotion o f entrepreneurship and
opening o f small and medium enterprises, (iv) transforming informal into formal employment
and making work more attractive, (v) enhancing the capacity o f the labor force to remain
active longer (active aging policy), (vi) enhancing the adaptability o f the businesses and
workforce to the changing labor market demand and supply, (vii) improving the quality o f
human capital through investing in life-long learning. Specific medium- and short-term
measures following from the Employment Strategy are implemented through Annual
Employment Action Plans.        On September 25, 2006, the Government and the nationally
representative organizations o f employers and employees signed an Economic and Social
Development Pact o f Bulgaria till 2009. The parties reached an understanding on the need to
reform the labor legislation, income and social insurance policies, including to abolish the
seniority bonus-an    additional remuneration for length o f service only-   and replace it with
merit and qualification-based wage increases, and to limit the role o f the state in employer-
employee relations. The parties agreed on measures to strengthen vocational education and
develop by 2007 a national strategy for life-long learning, to work towards increasing the
employability o f the vulnerable population groups, reduce unemployment to below 9 percent
and achieve an employment rate o f 61 percent by 2010.

61.     In social protection, the main activities include overcoming education
disadvantages, increasing access to social assistance, health and social services for
vulnerable groups, in particular people with disabilities and vulnerable ethnic
minorities. The government's program i s reflected in the EU Joint Inclusion Memorandum
(JIM) signed by the EUand the Government o f Bulgaria on February 3,2005, the Strategy for
Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion, the Poverty Reduction Action Plan for 2006, the
Action Plan for Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities 2006-2007 and other
strategic documents. In the medium-term, the GOB programs envisage measures to prevent
the institutionalization o f children and promote their reintegration in family environment,
improving the care for people with disabilities, especially for those placed in institutions for
mentally disabled, improving the access o f vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities to
schooling, health care and improved nutrition. The Government established the Agency for
People with Disabilities as an executive agency with the Ministryo f Labor and Social Policy
(MoLSP) and in March 2006 approved a strategy aiming at make it the "one-stop-shop" for
medical certification, social assessment and social integration services for people with
disabilities. To promote labor market integration o f people with disabilities, the Government
i s diversifying and scaling up targeted active labor market programs and services for them,
including pilot training programs and incentives for employers to hirepeople with disabilities.
The Government legally opened the provision o f employment and social services for non-

                                                                                             34

state providers (businesses, individual professionals and non-governmental organizations) and
public-private partnerships.              Certain services are decentralized and transferred for
management to the municipalities while financing remains the responsibility o f the state
budget. The expected outcomes o f these policies are reduction o f poverty, keeping inequality
at a low level, increasing the access to social care o f highquality, reduction o f the placements
ininstitutional care, andreducingthe number of early school leavers from the current level of
20 percent (2005) to the EUaverage o f around 15 percent2',

62.       In light of the low employment levels and the disincentives to job searching
created by the social assistance programs, the Government i s embarking on a program
to improve the effectiveness of social spending and to create an environment conducive
to employment promotion. The Government will promote labor demand both by lowering
the cost o f employment through the reduction o f the cost o f labor for the employers and by
promoting more flexibility in working hours and employment contracts. The high cost of
employment in Bulgaria i s associated mainly with the burden o f social security taxation.
Figure 5 shows that social security contributions inBulgaria are among the highest in Central
and Eastern Europe. It forces employers to cut back new hiringon formal labor contracts and
to try to remain competitive by hiring and paying informally and cutting on social
contribution payments. The Government has proposed amendments to the Labor Code to
introduce increased flexibility o f working hours and fix term and part-time contracts. It i s also
introducing changes in the social insurance code to lower the pension insurance contribution
rate by 6 percentage points from 29 to 23 percent, so as to ease the social contributions burden
on employers. The lower cost o f employment i s expected to motivate the creation o fnew jobs
and to motivate the conversion o f unofficial 'obs into official ones, increasing the quality o f
the existingjobs interms o fpay andbenefits.LJ2

22The last is possible because a major feature o f labor market informality i s that jobs are only partially
unofficial, meaning that they are registered but the wages declared for tax purposes are significantly lower than
the ones paid inreality.

63.    On the supply side, the Government's employment action plans aim at improving
employment activation measures within the social assistance system, limiting the extent
of subsidies for low qualification jobs and increasing the focus on Active Labor Market
Policies (ALMPs) which have demonstrated a positive net effect on employment. 23 The
National Employment Action Plan for 2006 contains a series o f actions aimed at shiftingthe
focus from low quality job subsidies to skill enhancement and qualification programs to
promote durable employment:
   A reduction by 54 percent in the number o f beneficiaries o f the main program offering
   low-quality community jobs - "From Social Assistance to Employment" from 91,630 to
   42,000 while increasing considerably the investment in programs that promote skill
   acquisition inthe private sector to match its needs, qualification, andtraining,
   Gradual relative expansion o f on-the-job training and qualification programs linked to
   private sector skill needs
    Giving preference to first-time applicants to employment under the "From Social
   Assistance to Employment" program;
   Introducing targeted literacy and vocational training programs for 2,500 individuals from
   vulnerable groups, particularly Roma;
   Increase individual incentives to find employment by adopting amendments to the
   Employment Promotion Act to introduce a monthly bonus for recipients o f social
    assistance who find employment at their own initiative, paid as a top-up to their monthly
    salary for one year
    Inthe mediumterm, introducingchanges to the disability insurance programto reduce the
   perverse incentives embedded inthe system, including changes inthe medical assessment
   process and the assessment criteria.

64.     Figure 6 shows that in2006 the planned spending on active labor market programs has
remained the same as percentage o f GDP but the number o f services provided has come
down, mostly to reflect the decrease in low quality supply o f jobs in the "From Social
Assistance to Employment" program.

65.       Employment activation measures and changes in the design of social welfare
benefits will allow for a better targeting of social assistance expenditures to the most
vulnerable groups while providing more structured support for those who can work to
participate in the labor market. Social assistance i s provided through two mainprograms -
the GMI and the Energy Benefit programs. The GMI program i s well targeted and with
strong redistributive effect among the poor transferring more than half o f the benefits to the
bottom 20 percent o fthe population. However, its coverage i s low, workfare requirements are
weak and it is inno way conditional to job search and labor market integration requirements.
Thus the program encourages passive reliance on social assistance and state provision o f
subsidized low-skilljob placements, and leaves the recipients in a dual poverty and inactivity
trap. Measures aimed at removing adverse work incentives and ensuring that the social system
i s more focused to core risk and vulnerable groups will help address the dual aim o f
promoting more activation and less passive reliance on Government transfers. To retarget
social assistance programs the government has introduced changes in the legislation which
limit GMI assistance for working age long-term beneficiaries without disabilities or sickness
to a maximum o f 18 months and suspend their right to reapply for 12 months thereafter. The
government will also keep the GMI benefit level for working age beneficiaries without
disabilities or sickness at the minimumlevel by applying the base coefficient.

66.       The Government program lays the ground for long-term productivity increases
through employment policy and education reforms. There may be a short-term trade-off
between employment and productivity: as a result o fmeasures to cut the cost o f labor (e.g. the
6 percentage point cut inthe pension contribution rate) which would promote the entry o f low
productivity workers, average productivity inthe economy may fall. This may be balanced, at
least inpart, by the formalization o f higher-productivity informal jobs, by the introduction o f
greater flexibility and extension inworking hours, and by making wages dependent mainly on
productivity rather seniority. However, in the medium and longer run, the Government
measures are set to trigger productivity increases in the economy, by increasing skills o f the
existing workforce through encouraging employers' investment in qualification programs and


                                                                                                               37

the inflow o f well educated, higher productivity labor market entrants as a result o f education
reform.

67.     The development of inclusive and demand-driven social services will help reduce
inactivity and foster integration in the labor market of social groups at risk of losing
competitiveness in the labor market.         These include mainly people with disabilities,
caregivers to people with disability and parents (mostly mothers) o f young children. The
government will increase the availability o f affordable community- and home-based
professional care for people with disabilities which will allow reintegrating o f able-bodied
family members in the labor market and acquisition o f pension rights instead of life-long
reliance on social assistance. The provision o f affordable child care i s very important for
removing barriers to re-employment o f their mothers. The Government is planningto develop
pilot experiences to make social services and the labor market more sensitive to the
employment and training needs o f people with disabilities.       The following Gantt Chart
summarizes the Government Program:




                                                                                               38

            V.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CPS
68.     The links between the D P L series and the Bulgaria CPS are strong, both formally and
conceptually. The CPS-which        was presented to the Board on June 13, 2006-includes       as
part of its base case scenario a series of three DPLs in the social sectors for a total o f $450
million. This comprises 50 percent o f the overall base case lending and the only budget
support operations to be financed by the Bank during the next three years. The policy
changes to be supported by the D P L series are intended to set the stage for implementing the
health and education strategies prepared by the government and to provide the backbone that
will guide investment operations in the social sectors-financed    by both the Bank and other
multilateral organizations.

69.     Conceptually, two o f the four overarching goals supported by the CPS are being
acknowledged inthe DPL series:

a. Raisingproductivityand employment in support of private sector-led growth along
    the lines of the EU's LisbonAgenda: The three programmatic DPLs (FY07-09) would
    support the productivity and employment agenda by focusing on: (i)       the reform of the
    labor framework and social protection system to increase employment by lowering payroll
    taxes, reducing social assistance dependency, reforming disability benefits, and increasing
    formal employment through more flexible work arrangements and better incentives to
    participate inthe formal economy and (ii)  the reforms inthe education sector to strengthen
    the institutional capacity to monitor and improve quality and increase accountability to lay
    the foundation for long-term productivity growth. .

b. Fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds: The DPL
    series would focus on improving the efficiency o f the health, education, pension and
    social assistance systems to support their financial sustainability and effectiveness. In
    health, the focus will be on improving financial sustainability of the NHIF, restructuring
    of the hospital sector, and improved efficiency inthe pharmaceutical sector. Ineducation,
    the DPLs will support finance and governance reforms that would help improve both the
    quality of education, and how efficiently the resources available for education are being
    used. The reforms in these sectors will also open windows o f opportunity to utilize EU
    funds as new programs are being created or old programs reformed.


COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS
70.     The IMF Board, on August 6, 2004, approved a 25-month SDR 100 million
Stand-By Arrangement of a precautionary nature. The IMF supports the Bulgarian
authorities' economic program as articulated inthe Memorandum o f Economic Policies dated
July 21, 2004. Cooperation between the Fund and the Bank has been and continues to be
strong, especially with respect to the general fiscal issues, education and social protection
sectors which are included in the IMF program. For example, the IMF program includes
fiscal surplus targets while the Bank supports improving the efficiency o f the hospital sector
which i s a major contributor to fiscal arrears. The IMF program also includes structural
benchmarks related to the increase o f work-time flexibility, the submission o f the education

                                                                                             40

sector reform strategy to Parliament and a reduction in the number o f redundant teaching
positions which are all complementary to the proposed D P L program. O n May 17, 2006 the
IMF decided to extend its program in Bulgaria by 6 months (until March 31, 2007) after
having involved the Bank actively in the discussions related to the social sectors. After the
expiration o f the SBA, the relationship would move towards regular surveillance. While the
Bank continues to rely on the donor coordination responsibility o f the Council for Economic
Policy (CEP), the Bank maintains strong and effective working relationships with donor
partners. These include the Open Society Institute (education decentralization) and the EU
(the absorption o f structural funds).


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS


71.     The DPL series i s complementary to existing and planned operations in the social
sectors, and i s intended to become the pillar around which future investments and policy
dialogue inthese sectors will be structured. The current health sector reform project includes
a component on hospital restructuring inselected municipalities and some technical assistance
for hospital master-planning activities.          In addition one of its main activities is the
strengthening o f the management and administrative capacity o f the NHIF, an essential
condition to improve financial sustainability and efficiency inhealth care provision.

72.     The proposed social inclusion project (FY07) will help to address the needs of
Bulgaria's most vulnerable groups (national minorities-in               particular Roma-people         with
disabilities, children in institutionalized care and others), in support o f meeting the goals of
the JIM signed with the EU. This operation will complement the DPL series in its objective
to improve targeting o f social welfare programs to reduce distortions in the labor market,
develop and agenda to improve the delivery o f social welfare services and promote access to
quality education. An Institutional Development Fund Grant has recently become effective.
The IDF grant will support capacity building in the Ministry o f Education and Science
through the strengthening o f CKOKO, the planned Institute o f Directors and the MES
department in charge o f developing programs aimed at absorbing European Social Funds.The
proposed regional development project (FY09) would address regional imbalances by
strengthening capacity to manage the programming and strategic allocation o f EU structural
funds, integrate them into public expenditure management and the intergovernmental fiscal
system, and capacity building at regional and local levels for project preparation and
absorption o f EU funds. It i s expected that the increased capacity o f Bulgaria to absorb
structural funds will feed into some o f the policies supported by the D P L series, like the
hospital restructuring, as has been the case in other countries in the region, like Estonia and
Latvia.

73.     The D P L series i s inmany cases a continuation o f the P A L 111, presented to the Board
in 2005. While the PAL I11was muchbroader in scope-having                     only one o f its five pillars
devote to the social sectors-the       DPL's more narrow focus allows for a higher degree o f
           As mentioned before the DPL complements and completes some o f the changes
undertaken under the P A L series. Some aspects and actions undertaken under the P A L I11


24The five pillars in PAL. I11 were:  sustaining structural reforms, establishing a market-fr-iendly business
environment, deepening financial system, improving public sector governance, and investing in human capital
and strengthening socialprotection.

                                                                                                          41

will continue to be developed and monitored by other parts o f the World Bank Program for
Bulgaria. For example the Economic and Sector Work (ESW) "Investment Climate for
Private Sector Growth and Employment" will make sure that objectives and commitments
made under the P A L I11continue to be pursued. The following table shows some examples of
complementarity between the P A L and DPL.

LESSONSLEARNED

74.        There are two main sources from which to draw lessons - the recently completed
Bulgaria P A L program and the analysis o f the social sectors in NMS-8. Whde all o f the
lessons from the P A L program are important for the DPL series, it i s worth noting two: (i)
EU accession and integration are often the drivingforce behind many reforms, but the Bank
can add value by helping the Government to design an implementation strategy for those
reforms and by providing lessons from international experience; and (ii)the use o f an
umbrella programmatic policy-based lending program, despite its complexity, can be an
effective instrument to concentrate high-level government commitment to support
implementation o f difficult reforms.25 Lessons from working with the NMS-8 are well

documented in the Bank's briefing to the new Government o f Bulgaria.26 Inparticular, it i s
noted that continuedpursuit o f structural, institutional and governance reforms i s necessary to
achieve the growth and productivity increases necessary for convergence with the other EU
member states (see Box 4). Additionally, progress in public finance reform i s necessary to
rationalize expenditures for efficiency and growth orientation, and to meet the financial
demands o f EUmembership.


ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

75.     The operation is well integrated with the World Bank's analytic and advisory work.
As part o f the preparation activities for the DPL Ithe Bank team prepared policy notes in
health, education, and social protection providing a comprehensive overview o f the three
sectors, highlighting the main problems, and identifylng key areas where Bank intervention
would be needed. In addition the D P L team prepared brief technical notes on hospital
restructuring, the pharmaceutical sector, education financing, assessment o f quality of
education, labor market and unemployment, disability cost containment, social assistance and
social services delivery, breaking the poverty and dependency cycle for ethnic minorities.

76.     Inthe education sector, and as part of the preparation of the DPL I,the World Bank
education team has worked closely with the MES and MOF in compiling a school level
expenditure data base, and investigating the drivers o f costs in education.          So far, an
exhaustive analytical note on teacher and non-teacher compensation has been prepared, and
another note on maintenance costs i s under preparation.         The education team has also
prepared a chapter for the forthcoming follow up to the February 2006 Public Finance Policy
Review -which     has been the basis for estimating the fiscal impact o f the education reforms.
The most recent Country Economic Memorandum was also consulted inthe preparation of the
DPL I, butit does not focus on the social sectors extensively.

77.     Finally the ongoing dialogue on poverty and living standards through the poverty
assessment programmatic work should provide additional information to be used in setting
baseline indicators and measuring the impact o f various reforms supported by the DPL
program. The programmatic work on poverty includes a household survey with education
andhealthmodules that will be usedto look at the effect o f stabilization measures inhealth on
out o f pocket spending and changes in the education financing on dropouts and access to
schooling.

 TransparencyInternational's 2005 corruptionperceptionindex ranks Bulgariain55" place among 159 countries (but still betterthan Polandand

 The latest EUreport, which determinedBulgaria's readinessfor accessioninJanuary of2007 discussesthe progressinthe fight againstcorruption
 at length. It lists anumberof actionstakento fight corruption, like: (i) the amendments to the `law onthe publication of the assets of persons

 declarationsby persons occupying highpublic positions; (ii) the Amendments to the Law on PoliticalPartiesadoptedinAugust 2006, stipulating

 Bulgariaacceptableto handleadministrationof ESFs.

 The reportshows that further progress is still necessaryinthe area ofjudicial reform andthe fight againstorganized crime and corruption.The
 Commissionhas establisheda mechanismto cooperateand verify progressinthese areas afteraccession. This will bebasedon Articles 37 and38
 of the Act of Accession. BothBulgariaandRomaniashallreport regularlyonprogressinaddressingspecific benchmarks.And the Commission
 will provide internaland external expertiseto cooperateandprovide guidanceinthe reform process andto verify progress. The Commission's

 The CPS acknowledgesthat improving governanceandstrengtheninginstitutionsis one ofthe mainchallengesinBulgaria. "Moving towards a
 transparent,honestand efficientjudiciary is one of the key requirementsfor improving the businessenvironmentandmeeting EUaccession
 requirements." Thereforethe Bankhas agreedto provideextensiveTA for judicial reform, initially throughtwo activities,first, non-lendingTA
 for Supportfor Justice Sector Modernization and Reform. Second, anIDF grant that will be submittedas aproposalin2006: Combating
 Corruption-Strengthening Anti-Corruption Capacity in the Ofice of the Prosecutor General. 7%        would eventually lead to additional activities
 in the sector, to complement the European Union involvement.

 Eventhough the DPLprogramdoes not address governance andcorruptionexplicitly, many ofthe policy actions agreedwith the Governmentwill
 improve governanceandincreasetransparencyinthe social sectors. Specifically(i) the unificationof paymentsto hospitalswill increasethe

         VI.      THE PROPOSED SOCIAL SECTORS INSITUTIONAL REFORM
                                    DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

78.      A social sector DPL series is the right instrument for supporting Bulgaria in its
transition towards full EUmembership. Bulgaria made significant progress inmeeting the
EUaccession criteriajoining the community inJanuary 2007. However to converge towards
EU standards o f living will require addressing those areas which will affect the productivity
o f the work force, the efficiency o f public spending, the inclusion o f minorities, and
addressing regional disparities. Since many o f the gaps are related to the social sectors the
GOB has requested Bank assistance inthese sectors specifically, recognizing their importance
for convergence and their pressingneed for further reform.27 The new coalition government
(inpower since August 2005) has made a commitment to prepare and present medium-term
health and education strategies. The education strategy was approved by Parliament in June
2006 while the health strategy is currently being discussed at the Council o f Ministers. A
D P L series focused on the social sectors would assist the government to transform these
relatively high-level strategies into concrete action plans with measurable indicators of
progress. The DPL series will provide a framework for implementation o f the strategies and
for targeting the work o f other donors. Finally, the DPL will commit the attention o f the
highest levels o f Government, and particularly the Ministry of Finance, to work together with
the social sector ministries, an issue that cannot be underestimated when important reforms-
like introduction o fnew financing formula for the education sector-are           contemplated.

 79.     A programmatic approach is preferable to other alternatives. Given the medium-
term horizon o f both the education and health strategies, a series o f single tranche loans i s
determined to be the best option to support their implementation. A series o f DPLs will allow
for sufficient flexibility to adjust to new information and changing circumstances during
implementation o f the new strategies and to change the scope o f the operation, if necessary,
over time. This is likely to happen as experience innew member states has shown that rapid
changes in the Bank's work program in these countries were required. The series structure
will also permit the specific sectors to follow different paces o f reform. Having a three year
flexible program provides an anchor for policy dialogue with social sectors during Bulgaria's
early membership inthe EU. It is expected that during this transition some new actions will
have to be considered, particularly those supporting absorption o f EU funds. Finally, a
programmatic approach also fulfills the goal o f providing a policy "umbrella" that could
frame future investment and technical assistance operations in the social sectors by the Bank,
and align the interventions o f other donors.

80.      The need for flexibility has been incorporated in the project design, which relies
heavily on the government's strategies and programs. The strategies prepared by the
Government provide a broad framework for the reforms in health, education, and labor and
social protection. The DPL series contribution to the government's program lies in the
provision o f concrete action plans in each sector together with technical assistance, and
specific monitoring indicators o f progress. The DPL series i s helping to transform ideas into
actions within a timefiame. The need for flexibility in light o f a very dynamic situation
prompted by EU accession and post-accession needs has been incorporated in the design of

POLICY AREAS


            Followingi s a description of the main areas supported by the DPL series. For
            each main area a set of actions to be included in the Policy Matrix are
            proposed.


81.     The DPL series has two overarching objectives that are closely linked to the CPS
objectives.     These are: (i)Increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term
productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of
education and; (ii) Promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in social sectors and
improve access to social services. A description o f the actions being supported by the DPL
under each objective and the expected outcomes follows.

I Increaseemploymentandlaythefoundationsforlong-termproductivitygrowth
by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of education

I.1.    Problem: Low employment, relatively high unemployment rates, high percentage of
long term unemployed, and high rates of informality in the labor market

82.     The Government, through the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy in particular, i s
embarking on a program to promote employment, which includes interventions to alter
incentives both on labor supply and labor demand sides.

83.     Prior actionsDPLI.The following prior actions havebeen completed:

(a)     The Government has enacted amendments to the Labor Code to increase flexibility o f
        working time and fixed term and part-time contracts;

(b)     The Government has enacted amendments to the Social Insurance Code to lower the
        contribution rate for pension insurance by 6 percentage points from 29 to 23 percent;

(c)     The Government has enacted amendments to the Employment Promotion Act to
        introduce a monthly bonus for unemployed recipients o f social assistance who find
        employment at their own initiative.

84.     Medium term actions (DPL I1 and DPL 111). In the medium term the DPL series
will support the GOBto introduce impact evaluation systems o f the main active labor market
programs. Based on the results o f the impact evaluations the DPL I1 and I11 will support
further restructuring o f active labor market programs to strengthen on-the-job qualification
and training programs linked to private sector skill needs and develop a medium term
program and institutional framework for professional training and qualification consistent
with European Social Fund priorities. Finally, the Government will continue its efforts to

                                                                                                  46

make the labor market more flexible by folding the seniority bonus into the base wage. The
mandatory seniority bonus which i s an additional remuneration for length o f service only,
limits individualwage formation based on merit, increases the cost o f hiring employees with
longer work history and hinders overall labor force mobility.

I.2.       Problem: Social Welfare Program design creates disincentivesfor job searching

85.         To create additional incentives for job searching and lower reliance o f able-bodied
individuals on social welfare programs the government will change eligibility criteria o f some
social assistance programs. The DPL series will support the impact evaluation o f these
changes and further reforms based on the results o f the evaluation.                                            Baseline data and
evaluation design will begin early in 2007. The DPL Iwill support the piloting o f some
programs to integratepeople with disability into the labor market.

86.        Prior actions DPL I. The following prior actions have been agreed:

(a)         The Government has developed and piloted one new project and scaled up one
            national program and two encouragement measures stipulated in the Employment
            Promotion Act to encourage labor market integration o fpeople with disabilities

87.         Medium term actions (DPL I1 and DPL 111). In the medium term the D P L series
will support the GOBto introduce an impact evaluation system o f the main social assistance
programs and monitor their effect not only on poverty and social indicators but also on job
creation. The next stages o f the DPL program will support additional measures to overcome
the long-term dependency on social assistance benefits and transition to work by improving
the targeting o f social assistance based on comprehensive impact evaluation of the GOB
policy limitingGMI assistance to able-bodied long-term unemployed to 18 months, improved
methodology for defining the poverty line, and refined structure o f minimum payments
(minimum wage, minimum pension, social pension, guaranteed minimum social payment).

                                                                                                                                     47

The DPL series will also support the introduction o f changes in the disability insurance
program as it has been shown that growth o f that program has hindered the incentives for job
searching.

88.        Expected outcomes (by 2009). By the end o f the DPL Program, the expected
outcomes are:

           i.Anincreaseintheemploymentratetoatleast60Percent(age 15-64,NSILFS
                data);

I.3        Problem: Quality of education has been decliningand the institutional capacityfor
quality assessmentis lacking

89.        The D P L Iwill support the Government's strategy to strengthen the MES institutional
capacity to assess the impact o f curricular and other reforms on the quality o f education. This
has the potential to radically switch priorities in policy making for the education sector,
bringing the quality o f student learning to the top o f the policy agenda. The Centre for
Control and Assessment o f the Quality o f Education will institutionalize and sustain the goals
of an efficient, transparent, and outcome-oriented education system. The DPL series will be
supporting four different testing activities in Bulgaria: a) a new placement test at the end o f
7th grade which has the potential to radically overhaul current patterns o f student access to
upper secondary school; b) designing and piloting a new Matura, i.e., secondary school-
leaving examination; c) new tests (sample or census-based) to be used strictly as system-wide
evaluation o f education quality; and d) managing Bulgaria's participation in international
achievement tests such as TIMSS, PISA, and PIRLS. Bulgaria has already participated in
some international assessment studies but without sustained interest and funding fiom the
MES, which prevents fiom taking full advantage o f the benefits associated with these
international endeavors. For example, Bulgaria has not participated in PISA since 2002. The

                                                                                                                     48

 DPL Iwill support the piloting o f the first o f those tests while the rest will be supported by
 DPL I1and D P L 111.

 90.         Prior actions DPL1. The followingprior actions have been completed:

 (a)         The MES has approved the 2007-2009 program o f activities to be implemented by
             CKOKO and CKOKO has implemented a pilot sample-based national assessment of
             student performance ingrade 7;

 (b)         Council o f Ministers has: (i)               approved an action plan for the implementation of the
             National Strategy for the Introduction o f Information Technologies in Bulgarian
             Schools, and (ii) to implement such action plan.
                                      started

  91.        Medium-term actions. The DPL I1 and I11 will support the introduction of the
 remaining testing instruments, the Matura (by 2008), the participation in international tests,
  and the additional tests to be used for quality assessment.28They will also support additional
 measures to improve quality like training o f inspectors, school directors, and the further
 implementationo f the strategy for the integration o f ICT inthe school curriculum.

ILl     Problem: Inefficiency in health serviceprovision and less than universal access to
care, as well as threats to the financial sustainability in the National Health Insurance
system

93.     The government i s adopting stabilization measures to control public spending on
health and introducing changes inthe pharmaceutical sector that should increase efficiency in
the commercialization o f new drugs, increase access to basic drugs to underserved groups of
the population, andhelp restore financial balance o f the NHIF.
Prior actions DPLI.The following measures have been adopted

(a)     Inorder to improve the financial balance of its national health insurance system, the
        Government has: (i)increased the health insurance premium revenue; (ii)          unified
        payment mechanisms for hospitals; (iii)   included limits inthe volume o f services to be
        paid by NHIF to hospitals in the draft budget law for 2007; and (iv) signed recovery
        planswith University, national andregional hospitals with a State majority ownership;
        and

(b)     The Government has submitted legislation to the Parliament to improve
        pharmaceuticalapproval, pricing and reimbursementpolicies to increase the efficiency
        o fpublic spending on pharmaceuticals and access to essential drugs.

94.     Medium-term actions.         In the medium term the Government will continue
implementing stabilization measures to maintain financial balance at the NHIF and start
planning and implementing the structural reform in the hospital sector.           The National
Framework Contract and the hospital payment system would be improved to increase
efficiencies and more rationale allocation o f health resources. Additional changes in the
pharmaceutical sector would be implemented in order to simplify approval and pricing
procedures even further and increase efficiency inNHIF spending on drugs.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE REFORM PROGRAM

100.    The program is broadly consistent with the medium term expenditure fkamework, and
the World Bank team has been working with both the Ministry o f Finance and the sector
ministries in estimating the additional spending required to implement some o f the policies
together with potential savings resulting from efficiency enhancing policies. Table 4 shows
the consolidated budget and budget projections for 2005-2009 for health and education, as
reported in the MTEF fkom June 2006.           Due to the large projected GDP growth, both
spending on health and education are expected to increase by about BGN 180-250 million per
year, even though the sectors spending as percentage o f GDP will decrease in 2006 and
remain constant thereafter.

101.    The MTEF incorporates the expenses necessary to implement the reforms supported
by the DPL series. In the case o f education, according to the MTEF summary report,
"...Greater effectiveness should be pursued within the available budget resources for the
education sector. It presumes optimization and gradual consolidation o f the large number of
schools and higher education institutes at a reducing number o f students with the purpose o f
increasing the studentdteachers ratio. Keeping the unnecessary capacity in the educational
system requires considerable resources for salaries and maintenance expenditures. The
released funds could be used for modernization o f the school base, higher salaries to teachers
and upgrading o f their skills and qualification, improvement o f the curricula and introduction
of modern training methods with the aim to improve the educational system results as a
whole. The overall reforming o f the educational system i s also needed in view to stimulating
human resource development and successfully training qualified staff meeting the
contemporary needs o fthe labor market".

102.    As for health the MTEF states that ``. .Inthe period 2007-2009 the expenditures on
                                                 .
healthcare are projected to grow by BGN200-220 million annually. However, more important
i s the attainment o f greater effectiveness o f those expenditures, better control and
optimization o f available resources and their targeting at improving the quality o f work o f
doctors and hospitals." and "...The experience in other European countries shows that the
regulation o f medicines' prices initselfis not sufficient for the attainment o f effective control
over expenses on medicines (a lot o f countries apply a combination o f regulatory measures
that comprise introduction o f additional payment for medicines prescribed, limitation o f the
number o f prescriptions per patient as well as the amounts under the prescriptions, laying
down a ceiling o f expenses on medicines, and the organizations o f doctors bear responsibility

"...The improvement of the quality of provided health services presumes adequate
for every excess expense)." Finally, the MTEF addresses the hospital consolidation plan:

maintenance o f existing capital assets at public health institutes. The closure o f wards or o f
entire health institutes havingunnecessary capacity as well as the merger o f hospitals with the
aim of reducingthe total administrative costs will be hardand yet necessary decision. Thus,
resources could be released for securing the pressingcapital expenditures".

103.   The reduction in short term revenues from a decrease of 6 percentage points in
the social security contribution i s expected to be offset by an expansion of the pool of
contributing workers and a higher reported wage over the medium term. As a result o f
the wage appreciation, the Government has projected that the contribution base for social
insurance will be expanding over the next few years and will partly cushion the NSSI revenue
decline. In the short term (2006 and 2007), the revenue shortfall associated with the cut i s
expected to trigger an increase in central government transfers compared to 2005 which has
been budgeted in 2006 and i s part o f the GOB'Smedium-term expenditure fi-amework 2007-
2009. Figure 7 presents the scenario, which for 2006 assumes nominal wage growth o f 11
percent and an increase inemployment by 4 percent or 118,000 jobs.

104.   The change in the contribution rate was implemented from the beginning of
2006, and initial results are encouraging- unlike projected, the revenues of the NSSI did
not decline in Q1 and Q2 of 2006. According to initial N S S I estimates, contribution
revenues increased by 12 percent in the first 6 months o f 2006 compared to the same
reference period in 2005. N S S I explains this mainly by the increase in officially reported
incomes following the reduction in the contribution rate. Private sector wages grew by 12.2
percent in Q1 o f 2006 compared to Q1 o f 2005 - the highest wage growth rate for the past 5
years. Meanwhile employment also picked up, albeit at a more modest rate, with a reported
40,000 newjobs inQ1 and 4 2 o f 2006 compared to the same reference period in2005.

105.         The other reform supported by the DPL with significant fiscal implications is the
education and governance reform. Figure 8 provides preliminary estimates o f the possible
costs and savings o f moving municipal schools in Bulgaria to a per capita financing scheme.
The graph on the left hand side o f Figure 8 illustrates the additional costs and savings under
the reform compared to current spending on municipal schools. The graph on the right-hand
side presents different scenarios for the future development o f education expenditure,
depending on the implementation o f the reform. The underlying assumptions are explained

106.         The total savings and costs arising fi-om the reform comprise (fi-om left to right in
Figure 8):
             (a)          an efficiency gain (estimated by the MOF when setting the initial hnding
                          rates),
             (b)          the "demographic dividend" (the saving associated with the fact that the
                          student population i s declining) and


                                                                                                                                                                     55

         (c)      expenditures on mitigating measures.29

107.     The efficiency gain (component (a))                  results from the following efficiency
improvements:
         First, schools can be consolidated, i.e. the students from formerly two schools can be
         served bythe buildings and staff o f one school, which reduces the overall cost.
         Second, as stated above, there i s a disproportionately high number o f non-teaching
         staff in the Bulgarian school system. If this staff were reduced (over and above any
         reduction implied by school consolidation), it could generate additional savings.

School level data shows that 794 schools in Bulgaria (that i s about 30%) operate at student-
teacher ratios below 11. Measures to consolidate these schools and reducing the overall
number to, say, 400 schools operating at ratios just above 11, could yield savings of over
BGN 80m per year. Moreover, a parallel reduction o f non-teaching staff by 30% (7,000
people) could yield additional savings o f about BGN 20m. The total amount o f possible and
acceptable savings i s a matter o f judgment. The figure o f nearly BGN lOOm shown in the
graph contains the combined consolidation and non-teaching staff reduction savings
considered possible by MOF. This first best scenario assumes that municipalities will respond
to the incentives and support measures provided by the central level to consolidate schools.

108.     The demographic dividend (component (b)) encompasses the savings that are made by
central Government budget due to the fact that the new funding accrues per student and
therefore accounts for declining student numbers. The dividend arises from comparing the
funding amount (under the new per capita regime) without student decline with the funding
amount with student decline. The demographic dividend grows per year (to the extent that
school-age population shrinks every year) and, in 2009, i s estimated at BGN 60m. The
positive fiscal effect o f the demographic dividend could be dampened if the population trend
observed inthe last two decades i s reversed; some evidence suggests this could happen inthe
near future.

109.     Figure 8 also factors inany mitigating and support measures during reform transition.
These would include a program to cover material improvement o f school buildings and a
busingscheme, as well as parent-involvement strategies, and municipal capacity support. The
annual expenditure for this i s estimated at BGN35m.

110.     The fiscal projections on the right hand side integrate all elements o f the reform that
have been agreed so far: schools will receive a per capita fundingamount from January 2007.
This amount has been proposed by the MOF and agreed with MES and NAM and differs
according to structural features o f the municipalities (e.g. population density). The baseline
scenario assumes spending grows at the rate o f GDP. The line immediately below the baseline
scenario shows how spending as percentage o f GDP goes down ifthere is full transition to the
per capita funding rates suggested by the MOF and compensating losing schools during two
years. The third scenario, generating the most savings includes additional savings from



                       ~~        ~


29The simulations show the pure effect of the changes supported by the DPL series. Irrespective of this it has
already been established elsewhere that overall spending in education is well below the average o f comparable
countries (as percentage o f GDP). It i s expected that as Bulgaria grows, overall spending will also grow and
achieve values closer to N M S averages.

                                                                                                           56

cutting all currently unallocated administrative e~penditure.~'Currently the Government i s
considering to retain total education spending at the baseline (Scenario 1) level, and to
compensate the reduction inper student amounts with increased program spending, including
mitigating measures related to school consolidation (illustrated by the vertical arrow).


                           VII. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS
111.     The HD DPL program would support improvements in health, education, labor
markets and social protection that are expected to have an overall positive impact on living
standards and contribute to increase equity in Bulgaria. The improvement o f the quality o f
education i s expected to increase equity in the medium- and long-term by buildingmarket-
relevant skills and thus improving the competitiveness and the earning capacity o f the future
labor market participants.

112.     Creation o f new jobs will be triggered by reforms that increase the flexibility o f the
labor market, reduce the cost o f labor for the employers and motivate taking a job instead of
long-term reliance on social benefits. The more flexible labor market decreases the barriers to
hiringandfiring and allows overall better utilization o fthe working time. This is expected to
bringan increase inthe incomes from work inthe form o f additional wages paid to the newly
hired on more flexible employment terms, and a wage increase for the current workers.
International evidence shows that the more flexible terms o f employment increase the
insecurity o fthose who are employed on permanent formal contracts (those who are inside the
labor market), but open more job opportunities for those who are outside and often more
vulnerable (those who are unemployed, working in the informal sector, or working on part-
time, fixed-term, seasonal or other types o f flexible contract arrangements).

113.     The lower cost o f labor for the employers due to the reduction in social security
contributions from 29 to 23 percent, is expected to broaden the contribution base, improve
compliance, promote the creation o f new jobs, reduce labor market informality and increase
overall job security. Initial evidence o f higher compliance and contribution base is already in
place - for the first 6 months o f 2006, revenues from social insurance contributions went up
by 0.8 percent. The official wages inthe private sector are expected to increase, however this
does not necessarily mean that workers will be actually receiving more than when paid fully
or partially informally. Even though take-home labor incomes may decrease as formal sector
employment increases -since          labor market legislation will apply to a larger segment o f the
market-     the quality o f the official/contractual jobs will increase compared to informality in
terms o f stability o f employment, predictability o f earnings andjob security (e.g. eligibility to
pensionbenefits and compensations incase o funemployment, sickness and maternity leave).

114.     The policy measures targeting activation o f long-term unemployed on social
assistance and labor market inclusion o f people with disabilities and other social groups with
barriers to access to jobs are expected to have a distinct positive impact on incomes. As a


30These are obviously ceteris paribus simulations, and the Bank team i s not advocating additional decrease in
the education budget as percentage o f GDP. The resources freed through the financing reform should be
reinvested in the system. Ths can take the form o f activities to improve quality and reduce drop out rates, as
discussed inprevious sections, or simply be fed back to increase the per capita funding rates.

                                                                                                           57

result o f the difference between the amount o f the monthly social assistance transfer for an
able-bodied individual and the lowest income from work (the minimum wage), the monthly
income o f those joining the labor market will increase over 2.5 times. Additional gains will
follow from the acquisition o f a work record, pension rights and entitlements to short-term
benefits (sickness, maternity and unemployment). It i s important that the proposed time limit
o f guaranteed minimum income payment to able-bodied, long-term unemployed on social
assistance i s paired with activation and job placement measures, including subsidized
employment. Although the implementation o f this measure will take place in an environment
of growing demand for formal labor, there might be social assistance beneficiaries with low
literacy and skills who could not be able to find jobs on their own. The DPL program will
support comprehensive impact evaluation which will allow identifying the potential `losers'
from this policy measure among the current 125,000 working age beneficiaries of social
assistance, to measure how it will affect the welfare status o f the poverty household and to
support the government inelaboration o f successful mitigation measures.

115.    The actions supported inthe health sector are expected to increase access to basic care,
as the reimbursement policies for basic drugs that are now preventing some groups from
obtainingthem at affordable prices will be thoroughly revised. Inaddition the restructuring of
hospital networks envisioned for the medium term should redraft the current mapping o f
health care facilities and promote access by (i)  shiftingthe focus from inpatient to outpatient
care, and (ii) using the resources saved from the hospital restructuring to improve quality in
lagging areas.

116.    Ineducation, the actions supported by the DPL are expected to have a positive social
impact through:
    improved student achievement at the secondary level, through a strengthened quality
    monitoring and supervision that is both evidence-based and gives a voice to parents,
    combined with greater school autonomy;
    increased student participation rates, through stronger incentives for schools to take
    students on;
    increased student completion rates, through stronger incentives for schools to retain and
    graduate students;
    improved equity in access through a differentiated funding regime that recognizes
    marginalized students andincentivates their enrollment and school retention
    improved teaching quality, through the availability o f solid and nuanced data on student
    achievement and the tailoring o f in-service teacher training to improve learning processes
    inschool.

117.    The adoption o f the per-student financing formula i s expected to rationalize resource
use in the school system, phase out suboptimal schools in terms o f student-teacher ratios,
decrease the share o f spending on salaries and increase expenditures related directly to higher
quality o f the learning outcomes (e.g. qualification o f the teaching force, improved curricula,
textbooks and teaching methods). The MES has gathered quantitative and qualitative data on
school closures prior to the introduction o f the new financing formula, in four municipalities.
Both the quantitative data and the stakeholders' stories differ so widely across the cases
studied that a common theme cannot be extracted. The only lesson emerging from the pilot
appears to be that existing issues andtrends ina school catchment area are the main drivers o f
participation and attainment, without school closures making a difference. Further work i s
ongoing on tracking individual student names from closed schools across receiving schools in

                                                                                              58

the four municipalities. Internationally, the evidence on school consolidation i s sparse. The
introduction o f per capita financing and governance reforms in various countries has not
nearly led to the amount o f closures already observed and expected for Bulgaria and i s
therefore not an ideal benchmark. A study in four rural communities in Nova Scotia found
that the benefits o f consolidation, including the material improvement at the consolidated
school, and the access to a bigger circle o f friends for both students and parents, outweighed
the cost o f additional travel. Initial fears and opposition o f local citizens were not ~onfirmed.~~
A study o f consolidation in Ohio confirms these findings and cites greater choice o f courses
for students as the main benefit32. Both studies do not observe an increase in drop-outs or
long-term staff unemployment.

118.    However, there i s a risk that school closures could lead indifferent students to drop
out, and that this may particularly affect marginalized groups and rural areas. The
Government acknowledges this and i s developing a comprehensive package to enhance
student participation, for example through a busingscheme (enabling free choice o f school in
a certain radius), free school meals and material improvement in consolidated schools. In
addition, the effect o f the new funding regime will be closely monitored on a quarterly basis
(see next section). Based on this, the fundingrates will be reviewed in order to counteract any
adverse impacts. For example, students more expensive to teach (because o f bi-lingual
requirements or special needs - this often affects the marginalized) may receive higher
fundingrates.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
119.    The CEP under the Council o f Ministers, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister o f Economy has undertaken the overall management and coordination of the
government program, assuring representation o f all the Ministries involved inthe reform (Le.
Health, Education, and Labor and Social Policy) and involvement o f M o F and Ministry of
Economy in the discussion o f the reform program. It receives well-organized and effective
support from the Directorate for European Integration and Relations with International
Financial Institutions (IFIs) o f the Council o f Ministers.                  In order to monitor the
implementation o f the program the Government will produce quarterly reports on the status of
the actions included in the Policy Matrix, indicating progress achieved and highlighting any
particular difficulties in their implementation. In addition, a number o f milestones for the
program, identified during preparation o f the D P L Iare included in the Gantt Charts for
health, education, and social protection respectively, and can be used as an additional
monitoring instrument.

120.    With regards to evaluation, there are many actions in the policy matrix that require
careful evaluation. The institutional and implementation context o f the proposed reforms in
education governance and financing does not allow for a rigorous impact evaluation. This i s
because there i s no comparison group, as i s usually the case with reforms implemented at the
macro level. However, it i s possible to monitor the development o f the desired outcomes
before, during and after the reform. This requires the collection o f a baseline o f the indicators
inthe policymatrix, anagreement ontheir target level andthe mechanisms for data collection

together with the MES units responsible for their collection.        Preliminary work for the
monitoring o f the Guarantee Fund to support school consolidation is already taking place. A
steering group with the MES, MOF, the NMA and experts has been set up to monitor the
disbursement o f the Guarantee Fundand the development o f activities financed. The Bank has
encouraged this development and pointed out that in addition, it would be desirable to
combine the routine financial reporting o f municipalities to the central Ministries with the
feeding back o f results indicators such as ' number o f students transported to consolidated
schools'.

121.    The Bank team agreed with MoLSP, OS1 and a representative of N S I to conduct
jointly with OS1 an independent multi-topic household survey. The survey will be
representative for consumption, incomes and non-monetary aspects o f poverty at national and
regional (28) level and will include boosters to allow assessing the income, educational,
health and labor market status o f the Roma and Turkish ethnic minority groups and
comparing them with the country averages. The multi-topic household survey i s part of the
programmatic work on poverty and living standards currently being conducted by the Bank,
and will identify baseline indicators for the monitoring and evaluation o f the impact of the
Bank assistance to Bulgaria in the first years o f accession. This includes the impact of the
Decade o f Roma Inclusion initiative, the Social Inclusion Project currently under preparation,
and the DPL program. Inaddition, with the household and additional data to be collected, the
team will measure social deprivation and the impact on beneficiaries o f specific programs,
like the strengthening o f the conditionality o f monthly child support to school attendance, the
social investments in children at risk and the limitation o f the GMI delivery to able-bodied
long-term unemployed to 18 months. The survey will also collect data on spending and
access to health care, including pharmaceuticals, which will allow to evaluate the effect of the
reform on access to basic health services.

122.    Finally, the DPL program incorporates as a trigger the implementation o f an impact
evaluation o fthe reform o f social welfare programs.

123.    The participation of stakeholders in the program design has been assured
through the support of the Government's strategies. The health and education actions in
the policy matrix are based on the strategies prepared by the MOH and MES respectively.
The preparation o f the strategies was done in a highly participatory manner. In addition the
DPL program was discussed with the main stakeholders: the line Ministries, Ministry o f
Finance and Ministry o f Economy; members o f Parliament and Parliamentary commissions
for health and education; associations o f employers, teacher unions, general trade unions, and
Bulgarian Medical Association and Bulgarian Nurses Association; health consumer groups
and NGOs. Inboth education and health, field visits were organized during preparation and
main components o f the program benefited from discussions in the field.             Finally, the
education reform was also discussed with the National Association o f Municipalities which
has endorsed it publicly.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
Public Financia1Management
124.    A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was submitted to the Government in
July 2004 which concluded that the environment for conducting public procurement in the
country as high risk. This CPAR has informed PAL-3 and D P L preparation, specifically, the

                                                                                              60

regulatory framework for public procurement has been improved under PAL-3, and the
government has made good progress in the initial implementation o f the CPAR action plan.
Bulgaria has adopted a new public procurement law (effective as o f July 1, 2006) with the
objective o f being fully aligned with the EU acquis. Development o f implementation
regulations, model tender documents and training o f procurement national cadre are required
to facilitate implementation o f the new law into practice. Procurement capacity issues exist
particularly for the Ministry o f Education and Science. An IDF Grant was extended to the
MES to build institutional capacity and improve performance inprogram developing, project
management, outcome measurement and partnership development and thus to increase the
capacity o f MES to absorb EU structural funds and other project financing. This IDF i s now
effective.

125.    The Bank has extended knowledge o f the country's Public Financial Management
(PFM) and fiduciary risk i s considered low. A Country Financial Management Assessment
(CFAA) was prepared in 2003. The CFAA highlighted strong features of or significant
achievements inPublic Financial Management (PFM), including: (i)        a well developed system,
(ii)soundlegislationandfunctioningexternaloversightinstitutions(namelytheNational
    a
Audit Office and the Parliament); (iii) enhanced budget process and comprehensiveness --the
latter through a significant reduction o f the number o f extra-budgetary funds--, (iv) the
beginning o f a pilot programmatic approach in three ministries, (v) the development of a
Treasury Single Account (TSA) to service all budgetary institutions; (vi) improved realism of
budget estimates, (vii) the restructuring o f the capital expenditure function, (viii) strengthened
cash management, (ix) an adequate internal control fkamework In 2003, fiscal transparency
was considered high.While the overall financial management risk to Bank funds was deemed
low, the CFAA made important recommendations -notably in the areas o f controls - that the
Government implemented, including under PAL-2 and PAL-3, and with continued technical
assistance from the donor community.

126.    Under PAL-2, the government developed a comprehensive program for strengthening
public expenditure management.         This included actions designed to increase allocative
efficiency and transparency inbudget formulation; to strengthen the budget execution system
and processes. The Government also strengthened the effectiveness o f internal and external
accountability arrangements. Capital expenditure management processes and systems were
aligned with European Union standards. The government moved forward with the
implementation o f the new Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) with the
long-term aim to expand the GFMIS to all spending entities in government. There i s an
update inthe accounting law, which became effective inJanuary 2005.

127.    Under PAL-3, the government (i)     improved its internal an audit practices - the Public
Internal Financial Control Act was amended in December 2005 to strengthen public internal
financial control and establish proper internal audit mechanism in the country; (ii)      improved
its external audit practices; (iii)improved public expenditure management processes,
including introduction o f a medium term fiscal framework, (iv) expanded program budgeting
in nearly half the ministries, (v) introduced accountability for results, and (vi) further
improved management o f capital expenditures.

128.    The D P L series i s in many cases a continuation o f the PAL-3, As mentioned before
the D P L complements and completes some o f the changes undertaken under the P A L series,


                                                                                                61

as illustrated in the action table (paragraph 73) showing some examples o f complementarity
between the P A L and DPL.

Disbursement,Accounts,Auditing, and ClosingDate
 129.   The proposed SIR D P L Iamount o f US$l50 million equivalent has been converted
into Euro during Negotiations. The borrower is the GOB, represented by the MOF. The
proposed D P L l i s the first o f the three planned development policy loans totaling up to
US$450 million equivalent as provided for inthe CPS, which was presented to the Board on
June 13th, 2006. Disbursement of funds will be triggered by satisfactory progress in the
reforms set forth in the loan. The loan will be disbursed in one tranche immediately upon
effectiveness.   The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy lending. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, thus
evidence will not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement requirements be
necessary.     Upon approval o f the loan and notification by International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) o f loan effectiveness, the government will submit a
withdrawal application to the IBRD. At the request o f the MOF, the IBRD will deposit the
proceeds o f the loan into a foreign exchange deposit account (deposit account) designated by
the government that form part o f the general reserves o f the country and acceptable to the
Bank, such account to be held at the BulgarianNational Bank (BNB). Prior to that, the Bank
will withdraw from the Loan Account a front end fee amounting to 1 percent o f the loan
amount, subject to any waiver. This account is available for budget financing and will be
managed by and subject to the control o f the MOF. The government shall ensure that upon
deposit o f the net proceeds of the loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be
credited inthe Borrower's budget management system, ina manner acceptable to the IBRD.

130.    Ifafter the loanproceeds are deposited inthe BNBaccount, the proceeds areused for
ineligible purposes as defined inthe loan agreement, IBRDwill require the borrower to either:
(a) return that amount to the Deposit Account in BNB for use for eligible purposes or (b)
refund the amount directly to IBRD.

131.    The administration and accounting o f the loan proceeds will be responsibility o f the
Ministry o f Finance. The standard country rules will be followed by treasury for
administration and accounting. The government will maintain accounts and records, or ensure
that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in accordance with
provisions o f the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form
acceptable to the Bank. The proceeds o f Loan deposited at the treasury account with BNB
will be used to cover budget expenditures. The MOF will be responsible for the Operation's
administration and for preparing the withdrawal application, maintaining the deposit account
as required. The MOF, with the assistance o f the BNB, will maintain records o f all
transactions under the Operation in accordance with sound accounting practices. The
government will report to the IBRDon the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system within 30 days o freceiving such fund.

132.    The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment o f the BNB in 2002 and found that
safeguards are generally adequate. Recommendations bythe IMFwere promptly addressed by
the BNB. Past audits and the positive assessment by the IMF provide significant assurance
that the loan will not be inappropriately used.      The Bank had chosen to exercise its
prerogative to audit the deposit accounts under PAL1 and PAL2, and the audits were
unqualified and acceptable to the Bank.Accordingly, the Bank decided not to require an audit

                                                                                           62

o f the loan proceeds under PAL-3. Considering the Bank's knowledge o f the public finance
management systems, the ongoing improvements o f these systems and considering the
positive assessment o f the BNB made by IMF, the Bank will not require an audit o f the loan
proceeds under this DPLl, which i s consistent with PAL-3 operation.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
133.     No significant environmental impacts are associated with D P L I. The reforms
supported by the program are related to the adoption o f policies and only a few could have a
future environmental impact. Specifically, reforms in the education sector are expected to
result in consolidation o f schools, and this will in turn require changes in some schools
infrastructure (e.g. school rehabilitation).  Similarly, the reforms in the health sector are
expected to lead to changes inthe hospital sector, including consolidation, conversion o f some
facilities, and therefore require investments in hospital infrastructure. These actions which
may have environmental impact are expected to occur only during the second or third phase
o f the DPL program. The rehabilitation o f education and health infrastructure would require
compliance with the national environmental and construction codes which are now in line
with EUstandards.

       BULGARIA: FIRST DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (DPL-1)
                    LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY


                                                                   February 5, 2007


Mr.Paul Wolfowitz
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr. Wolfowitz:

1.      W e appreciate this opportunity to request continuing support from the World
       Bank for the implementation o f our medium term reform agenda and, on behalf
       o f the Government o f Bulgaria, we request a First Development Policy Loan
       (DPL-1) for U S $150 million equivalent to initiate the series o f three
       development policy loans as per the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
       between the World Bank and the Republic o f Bulgaria approved by the World
       Bank Board on June 13Ih', 2006. W e believe that this new series o f development
       policy loans provides the appropriate vehicle for Bank support in addressing our
       medium term policy and institutional reform agenda, and in supporting the
       country in its full integration into the European Union after the accession on
       January 1, 2007.

2.       Following completion o f the Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALS)
       program and during the preparation o f the recently approved CPS we requested
       assistance from the Bank to continue supporting reforms in the social sectors
       and it was agreed that the D P L series would focus on these sectors exclusively.
       Conceptually, two o f the four overarching goals supported by the CPS are
       being acknowledged in the D P L series:

    Raising productivity and employment in support of private sector-led growth
      along the lines of the EU's Lisbon Agenda: The three programmatic DPLs
      (FY07-09) will support the productivity and employment agenda by focusing on:
      (i) reformofthelaborframework andsocialprotectionsystemto increase
          the
      employment by lowering payroll taxes, reducing social assistance dependency,
      reforming disability benefits, and increasing formal employment through more
      flexible work arrangements and better incentives to participate in the formal
      economy and (ii)the reforms in the education sector to strengthen the
      institutional  capacity   to   monitor   and   improve    quality  and   increase
      accountability to lay the foundation for long-term productivity growth.

                                                                                      65
                                          1

      Fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds: The
       D P L series will focus on improving the efficiency o f the health, education,
       pension and social assistance systems to support their financial sustainability
       and effectiveness. In health, the focus will be on improving financial
       sustainability o f the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), restructuring of
       the hospital sector, and improved efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector. In
       education, the DPLs will support finance and governance reforms that would
       help improve both the quality o f education, and how efficiently the resources
       available for education are being used. The reforms in these sectors will also
       open windows o f opportunity to utilize EU funds as new programs are being
       created or old programs reformed.


3.       W e expect that at the end o f the D P L series (i) employment rate will have
                                                           the
increased to at least 60 percent; (ii)  the hospital sector will be streamlined and more
resources will be allocated to outpatient care, therefore reaching a larger percentage
o f the underserved population; (iii)a basic package o f drugs will become more
affordable and therefore available to a wider segment o f the population; and (iv) quality
o f education will have improved, and completion rates will have increased.

4.       W e have maintained macroeconomic stability as a precondition for the
effectiveness and sustainability o f the above program. W e will maintain the Currency
Board Arrangement (CBA) until the adoption o f the Euro. The C B A has served
Bulgaria well, providing a stable monetary environment, contributing to l o w inflation,
and boosting confidence. W e are fully committed to take all o f the necessary steps to
support it. W e will continue to implement a cautious and flexible fiscal policy, which
i s a key to safeguarding external viability under the CBA. W e have aimed to reach,
and then maintain, a broadly balanced fiscal stance in the medium term, remaining
prepared to adjust our fiscal policy in case o f further widening o f the external current
account deficit.

5.       The IMF has completed the third review o f the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
in August 2006. A precautionary 25-months SBA with access o f SDR100 million was
approved by the IMF Board on August 6, 2004, and the first review was completed on
M a y 18, 2005, and the second in April 2006. The SBA-supported program seeks to
reduce Bulgaria's increased external vulnerability and to achieve sustainable high
growth through: (i)   continued tight fiscal policy and measures to reduce bank liquidity
in order to reduce excess demand inthe short run; and (ii)     structural reforms to boost
output and export capacity in the medium-term. At completion o f the third review and
in light o f Bulgaria's continued high external vulnerability, the IMF and GOBdecided
to extend the SBA by 6 months beyond September 2006 to continue monitoring
program implementation by end-2006, and complete the reporting to the IMF Board by
end-March 2007. Once Bulgariajoins the EU, its participation in the EU's Stability and
Growth Pact (SGP), with related multilateral surveillance, would help to sustain
Bulgaria's prudent macroeconomic policies.

6.       In the course o f preparing the First Development Policy Loan, we have
developed and implemented various components o f our reform program that will be

continued in the series o f D P L 2 and 3. The final design o f DPL-1 has benefited fiom a
strong monitoring and evaluation system, implemented in coordination with the Bank
and built during the preceding series o f PALs. This has enabled us to take actions
necessary to ensure the sustained implementation o f policies and the successful
outcomes o f institution-building efforts. The programmatic approach o f the PALs will
be transferred to the DPLs as it provides us with the flexibility to make sound adjustments
in our program and to build on new information and additional experience in institutional
design and implementation in moving towards the successful achievement o f our
strategic objectives and program outcomes.

7.       This Letter o f Development Policy summarizes the elements o f our program
 supported by DPL-1 and with expected follow up in DPLs -2 and -3, while the reform
 program outcomes and the critical steps taken to achieve those outcomes are
 summarized in the accompanying Matrix o f Performance Benchmarks and Desired
 Outcomes.

8.       The first phase o f the program i s dominated by the introduction o f changes in
the social protection sector to create additional incentives for employment generation,
and the definition o f a new funding mechanism for schools. These measures are
accompanied by actions to stabilize public spending on health, mitigate the impact o f
the changes in education financing on access, and improving the institutional capacity
in the education and health sectors. The second phase will focus on supporting full
implementation o f the new education financing formula, introduction o f governance
changes in the sector, implementation o f some o f the actions included in the medium
term vision for social protection, and additional actions to maintain financial balance
in the health sector. The third phase supports the consolidation o f the financing and
governance reforms in the education sector and implementation o f structural reforms
in the supply o f health care services; this phase is also expected to show some early
results from the previous two phases o f program implementation.

9.       The DPL overarching objectives related also to the Country's strategic
priorities and the approved CPS are:

Overarching Objective 1: Increase employment and lay the foundations for long-
term productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving
quality of education

10.      Through actions under this objective the D P L series will solve several
problems.

11.      First, low employment, relatively high unemployment rates, high percentage of
long term unemployed, and high rates of informality in the labor market are an issue.
Our government, through the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy in particular, is
embarking on a program to promote employment, which includes interventions to
alter incentives both on labor supply and labor demand sides. Under the D P L 1 we
have enacted amendments to the labor code to increase the flexibility o f working time
and fix-term and part-time contracts. W e also have enacted amendments in the social
insurance code to lower the pension insurance contribution rate by 6 percentage points
from 29 to 23 percent. Finally, we enacted amendments to the Employment Promotion

                                            3                                           67

Act to introduce a monthly bonus for unemployed recipients o f social assistance who
find employment at their own initiative.

12.      Second, we will tackle theproblem of the Social Welfare Program design
creating disincentivesfor job searching. To create additional incentives for job
searching and lower reliance o f able-bodied individuals on social welfare programs the
government will change eligibility criteria o f some social assistance programs. The
D P L series will support the impact evaluation o f these changes and further reforms
based on the results o f the evaluation. Baseline data and evaluation design will begin
early in 2007. As part o f DPL-1 we have developed and piloted programs and services
for labor market integration o f people with disabilities.

13.      By the end o f the DPL Program, the expected outcomes are:

         i.Anincreaseintheemploymentrateto atleast60Percent(age 15-64, NSI
             LFS data);
         ii.A reductionofnumberoflow-qualitysubsidizedjobsby25 percentfrom
             the 2005 baseline;
         iii.Reductionofatleast10percentinthenumberofhouseholdsreceivingsome
             social benefit from 76% percent inthe end o f 2003 (MTHS data); and
         iv. An increase incontributions to social security larger than the growth rate o f
            wages.

14.      Third, we will address the problem that quality of education has been declining
and the institutional capacity for quality assessment is lacking. The D P L Iwill support
our strategy to strengthen the Ministry o f Education and Science's (MES') institutional
capacity to assess the impact o f curricular and other reforms on the quality of
education. This has the potential to radically switch priorities in policy making for the
education sector, bringing the quality o f student learning to the top o f the policy
agenda. The Centre for Control and Assessment o f the Quality o f Education (CKOKO)
will institutionalize and sustain the goals o f an efficient, transparent, and outcome-
oriented education system. The DPL series will be supporting four different testing
activities in Bulgaria: a) a new placement test at the end o f 7th grade which has the
potential to radically overhaul current patterns o f student access to upper secondary
school; b) designing and piloting a new Matura, i.e., secondary school-leaving
examination; c) new tests (sample or census-based) to be used strictly as system-wide
evaluation o f education quality;       and d) managing Bulgaria's participation in
international achievement tests. As part o f DPL-1 we have approved a three-year plan
for CKOKO, and our Council o f Ministers approved action plan for the implementation
o f the National Strategy for the Introduction o f Information Technologies in Bulgarian
Schools and begins implementation.

15.      By the end o f the DPL Program, the expected outcomes are:

        i. CKOKOpreparesannualreportsontheassessmentofeducationqualityand
            makes them available to schools, parents, other stakeholders inthe education
            sector and public opinion in general;

        iv. 35 percent of subjects inthe primary and secondary educationcurriculum have e-
            technology and multimedia content available to teachers and students.

 Overarching objective 2 : Promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in
 social sectors and improve access to basic social services

16.       Under this overarching objective we will address two main problems.

17        First, the inefficiency in health serviceprovision and less than universal access
to care, as well as threats to the financial sustainability in the National Health
Insurance system. The government i s adopting stabilization measures to control public
spending on health and introducing changes in the pharmaceutical sector that should
increase efficiency in the commercialization of new drugs, increase access to basic drugs
to underserved groups of the population, and help restore financial balance o f the NHIF.
As part o f the DPL-1 we adopted a number of measures inorder to improve the financial
stability of NHIF: (i)     increased the health insurance premium revenue; (ii)unified
payment mechanisms for hospitals, (iii)      included limits in the volume o f services in
contracts between NHIF and hospitals in the draft NHIF budget law; (iv) signed
recovery plans with hospitals where MOH i s majority shareholder; and (v) the
Parliament has approved legislation, at least through the first reading o f the Health
Commission,       which     would   improve    pharmaceutical    approval,   pricing,   and
reimbursement policies to increase the efficiency o f public spending on pharmaceuticals
and access to essential drugs.

18.       By the end of the DPL Series (2009), the expected outcomes are:
         i. financial projectionsofspending andrevenues show thehealthsystemis
         .. financially sustainable;
         11.  the proportion o f spending on outpatient care relative to inpatient care has
              increased by 5 percent;
         iii.consolidationactivities for hospitalsmoveefficiencyindicators closerto
              those o f EU (e.g. average length o f stay, number o f beds, and inpatient
              admissions decreases);
         iv. The percentage of the Bulgarian population reporting access to essential
            pharmaceuticals increases (baseline and outcome to be measured by
            household surveys in 2007 and 2009) and the NHIF data shows a higher
             aggregate number o f prescriptions (per insuree) and a higher average
            reimbursement rate for an agreed list o f essential drugs; and
         v. NHIF data showing that pharmaceutical spending is within budget and
            growing at a rate not higher than twice GDP growth.

 19.     The second problem is that current governance and financing system for
schools is not conducive to increased accountability and does not provide incentivesfor
efficient use of resources. W e are undertaking a governance and financing reform o f the
municipal school network, involving the introduction o f a per capita funding formula
and progressive devolution o f responsibilities to local and school levels. Under DPL-1
have already approved new unified standard for allocating funds to municipalities for

                                             5                                           69

their school networks and the plan for a phased introduction o f the new financing
formula. We also approved a package o f measures and incentives to support school
consolidation and the introduction o f the unified standard.

20.     By the end o f the DPL Series (2009), the expected outcomes are:
       i.an increase in the average pupil teacher ratio for lower secondary
           schools from the 2006 level to the prevailing ratio according to the best
           European practice;
       ii.all municipalities, meeting the standards defined by an inter-Ministerial
           Working Group, will have access to the Government program o f measures
           and incentives to support school consolidation and the introduction o f the
           unified standard;
       iii.in.anincreasedsatisfactionofmunicipaleducationdepartmentheadsandof
           school directors with the new school financing formula and with the
           Government Program o f measures and incentives to support school
           consolidation and the introduction o f the unified standard (beneficiary
           assessment; measured against baseline survey); and
       iv. an   increased   parent/student    satisfaction   with   consolidated schools
           (beneficiary assessment; measured against baseline survey).

21.    W e would like to reiterate that the Bulgarian Government is committed to
continuing reforms and, in particular, to sustaining and continuing the reform agenda
needed for the integration into the EU as defined above. A new government program
will further define the specific actions inthe months ahead. We look forward to the
World Bank's support to Bulgaria in its development program including through
development policy loans focusing on the current and future reform agenda.

VII.   SafeguardsAssessment:


Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) was
subject to an assessment with respect to the SBA which was approved on February 27, 2002.
The assessment, completed on June 12, 2002, identified certain weaknesses and made



33Onexpectationbasis.
                                                                                      73

appropriate recommendations, as reported in IMF Country Report No. 02/174. An updated
assessment, which was conducted with respect to the current SBA and completed on
November 23, 2004, found that the BNB's financial statements had been improved and
earlier audit qualifications eliminated, the scope o f the internal audit function had been
widened and a risk-based audit methodology had been introduced. N o major vulnerabilities
in the safeguards framework were identified. The mission's recommendations to further
solidify Bulgaria's safeguards are being implemented.

VIII. ExchangeArrangement:


An amendment to the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) effectively established a
currency board arrangement from July 1, 1997. The deutsche mark was chosen at par as the
peg currency, which has since been replacedwith the euro at the rate o f lev 1.95583 per  1.
According to Article 30 o fthe Law on the BNB, the BulgarianNational Bank shall be bound
to sell and purchase on demand euro against levs up to any amount within the territory of
this country on the basis o f spot exchange rates which shall not depart from the official
exchange rate by more than 0.5 percent, inclusive o f any fees, commissions and other
charges to the customer. Bulgaria has accepted the obligations o f Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 o f the Articles o f Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is fiee of
restrictions on the makingo fpayments and transfers for current international transactions.

IX.     Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 2,2006 (see IMF Country Report
No. 06/298). The Acting Chairman's summing-up o f the discussion was circulated as
SUR/06/84. Bulgaria i s on a 12-month cycle.

X.      FSAPParticipationandROSCs:

Bulgaria participated in an FSAP held from October 29 to November 14, 2001. A follow-up
to the FSAP update was conducted as part o f the 2004 Article IV consultation mission.
