CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project for the consolidation and ex-
pansion of land settlement in the Caqueta area of the Amazon Province.
A Bank loan of US$8.1 million is proposed.
ii.       In many parts of Colombia peasant farmers have insufficient land
to make a reasonable living, and it is estimated by Government that to
correct this situation some 360,000 families would have to move out of
overpopulated areas, and that land would be required for a further 50,000
families annually. While Colombia has no real shortage of agricultural
land, much of this lies to the east of the Andes and is inaccessible at
present. The costs of a program to move large numbers of people into
these areas and assist them to develop economic farms would be prohibitive
at the present time. Fortunately there are some accessible and partly de-
veloped areas where settlement can be carried on at a reasonable cost and
would be economically justified; Caqueta is one. In this area spontaneous
settlement has developed, and a system has evolved which could be replica-
ted, in due time, in areas further east.
iii.      The project would comprise constructing about 380 km of roads
in the Caqueta area to service some 3,500 partially established settlers,
and to open up 280,000 ha of undeveloped land for a further 2,800 new
settlers. It would include the provision of credit for farm development,
land clearing, fencing, livestock and other farm inputs for the 3,500
partially established settlers, as well as for about 1,000 settlers
of the 2,800 expected to move into the project area during the develop-
ment period. About 90 primary schools and six health centers would be con-
structed under the project and a simple experimental program aimed at im-
proving rice and pasture production would be initiated.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$21.6 million equivalent during
the three year disbursement period of the proposed Bank loan. Of this
total, US$6.6 million would be for road construction, US$7.5 million for
farm investment, US$5.2 million for incremental seasonal farm inputs,
US$0.75 million for buildings, and US$1.5 million for administration,
vehicles and equipment. The proposed loan would finance the foreign ex-
change costs, estimated at US$5.5 million, 25%, and US$2.6 million of
local currency costs, together amounting to 38% of total project costs.
The Government would contribute 30% of project costs, and farmers the
remaining 32%. Procurement for goods and services would be by local and
international competitive bidding, but in view of the nature of the goods
required, and the existence of many well qualified Colombian civil works'
contractors, it is doubtful whether the value of international contracts
would be significant.



- ii -
v.        The project would be implemented by the Instituto Colombiano de
la Reforma Agrarian (INCORA), an autonomous public body.  INCORA is respon-
sible for carrying out two Bank financed projects, the Atlantico Irrigation
Project (502-CO), and the Agricultural Credit Project (624-CO). INCORA is
well managed and operates ongoing colonization in Caqueta.  Long term loans
for farm development would be made through the Banco Canadero, (BANCO) a
private bank in which Government holds a minority shareholding, and short
term loans would be made through the Cata Agraria (CAJA).
vi.       The project would create a livelihood for about 6,3MO families,
and generate employment opportunities for about another 1,700 non-farm
families; about 55,000 people in all would benefit. The principal farm
products would be rice, beef cattle and pigs which would be consumed
within Colombia; project farms would also produce the subsistence food
requirements of the occupiers. Importantly the project would'cdntinue
a process of low cost settlement capable of replication elsewhere in Colom-
bia and in countries with similar conditions and agrarian problems.
vii.      Based on estimated future farm gate prices and present crop and
livestock yield levels in the project area, the economic rate of return
from investment in the project is estimated at 16.5%. Participating families
would obtain incomes of about US$1,000 annually plus subsistence, a satis-
factory income when compared with the near subsistence level of many Colom-
bian cultivators.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Government
of US$8.1 million for a period of 20 years including 4 years grace.



C0LOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has applied for a Bank loan to finance
the consolidation and expansion of land settlement in the Caqueta Intenden-
cia of the Amazon Province (see Map 1). The project would be administered
by the Instituto Colombiana de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA). A first phase
of this settlement, which benefitted 3,500 farmers at a cost of nearly
US$10 million, was financed by Government and a USAID loan.
1.02      The joint Bank/PAO mission 1/ which reviewed INCORA's operations
in 1967 came to two major conclusions. Firstly, that INCORA's existing
program lent itself to immediate expansion, and ought to include credit
not only to large scale but also medium-sized farmers. The Agricultural
Credit Project (Bank Loan 624-CO amounting to US$17 million), through which
INCORA provides credit to medium-sized farmers, is the outcome of this con-
clusion. Secondly, that to improve the balance of INCORA's investment pro-
gram, more emphasis should be given to land settlement and colonization
schemes, which should include road construction for improved access to farms
and markets. This project would be in line with the second conclusion.
1.03      The Bank has made six agricultural loans to Colombia:
(a)  18-CO   :  First Agricultural Machinery Project   - US$5 million
(1949)
(b) 108-CO       Second Agricultural Machinery Project  - US$5 million
(1954)
(c) 448-CO   :   First Livestock Development Project    - US$16.7 million
(1966)
(d) 505-CO   :   Atlantico Irrigation Project              - US$9 million
(1968)
(e) 624-CO   :  Agricultural Credit Project                - US$17 million
(1969)
(f) 651-CO   :   Second Livestock Project                  - US$18.3 million
(1969)
1/   Report No. TO-611.



-2-
1.04      The first and second machinery loans have been repaid.  The
first Livestock Project (448-CO) progressed well for two years but lending
has now slowed down because the Caja de Credito Agraria, Industrial y Minero
(CAJA) failed to provide sufficient short term credit to farmers; the sec-
ond livestock loan is not yet effective. The Atlantico Irrigation Project
(502-CO) is a little behind schedule as pockets of unsuitable soil made it
necessary to redesign the irrigation layout, but future progress should be
satisfactory. The loan for the Agricultural Credit Project (624-CO) became
effective in November 1969, and the project is now beginning to get into its
stride. INCORA is responsible for implementation of the Atlantico Irriga-
tion and the Agricultural Credit Projects.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a mission which visited
Colombia in January/February 1970, composed of Messrs. A. Storrar, H. Amin-
Arsala, J. Gregor (part-time), A. van Dijck (part-time), and R. Hewson
(FAO). Mr. A. Stoneham helped prepare the financial and credit sections.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Colombia, with a total area of 1.14 million km2, has a wide range
of climatic conditions, varying from tropical to alpine, which permit the
production of almost any agricultural crop and livestock product. The most
heavily populated rural areas are in the temperate and sub-tropical zones,
but the tropical Amazon basin, where the project would be located, covers
one-third of Colombia's land surface area and contains only 1% of its popu-
lation.
2.02      Agriculture accounts for about 30% of gross domestic product,
75% of all exports, and virtually satisfies the country's food require-
ments. Livestock represents over two-fifths of total agricultural produc-
tion. Coffee production, which cannot be expanded because of the interna-
tional coffee agreement currently accounts for 60% of commodity exports.
The gross value of other agricultural production is expanding at an annual
rate of over 4%, thus gradually reducing the relative importance of coffee.
2.03      Population, estimated at about 22 million, is increasing by an
estimated 3.3% annually. About 50% of those economically active are in-
volved with agriculture. The 1960 census reported 1.2 million agricultural
families; of whom 7% owned 75% of the agricultural land (an average of 400 ha
each), and 62% farmed 4% (3 ha each). There are now about 1.5 million agri-
cultural families. As a result of INCORA's program for purchasing and sub-
dividing some of the large estates and its colonization program, the share of
land held by the smaller farmers is increasing.



2.04      Annual income per capita is estimated at about US$300 but in the
more densely populated agricultural areas most peasant farmers have a much
lower income, many living at bare subsistence level. Such low incomes are
due partly to poor farming methods, and in many cases to a shortage of culti-
vable land. Even with improved skills many small farmers would not be able
to make a satisfactory living due to the small farm size.
2.05      It is estimated that some 700,000 farmers are in the latter class,
and that about 300,000 families would have to move to new areas to allow the
remainder to develop economically sized farms. In addition, an estimated
one-half of the current 120,000 landless farm workers need land. Government
is therefore faced with the need to make land available for some 360,000
families and, at the same time, to improve the lot of those who remain in
the over-crowded areas. Since the number of farming families is increasing
by 50,000 annually, Colombia faces a formidable problem, which can only be
partly solved by accelerated colonization.
B. INCORA and Agrarian Reform
2.06      Although the need for agrarian reform has long been apparent, it
was not until the Agrarian Reform Law 135 was passed in 1961 that Government
took active steps to implement a land reform policy. The law also established
an autonomous public body, INCORA, as the main instrument for carrying out
such policy. INCORA is more fully described in Annex 1. INCORA's main
objectives are to reorganize the agrarian social structure, to encourage
economic development and exploitation of uncultivated or inadequately used
land in private holdings, to increase agricultural productivity, to improve
contractual arrangements for small tenant farmers and share croppers, to
raise the level of living of the rural population and to facilitate conser-
vation, improvement and adequate utilization of natural resources.
2.07      Government has already made uninhabited land of relatively easy
access available for resettlement. Such areas are limited, however, and
development of the extensive but more distant uninhabited land would be
uneconomic at present due to the heavy infrastructural costs involved.
Government has purchased about one million hectares of agricultural land from
the larger farmers (about 5% of the land held by this group), for redistri-
bution, but political, administrative and financial problems make this a
slow process. Although there are some 300,000 farmers living in poverty in
the present overcrowded areas, they are conservative in their outlook and
many of them are unwilling to move to new and more favorable areas. Thus,
the problem of land redistribution is proving to be a slower process than
first anticipated.
2.08      INCORA has developed 42 projects to date (see Map 1); 11 coloni-
zation projects on new land, and the remainder irrigation and land redis-
tribution. About 100,000 families have benefitted from colonization and
irrigation schemes, and 14,000 have been settled on subdivisions of large
estates. In the future, INCORA intends to pursue vigorously both coloniza-
tion and land redistribution projects.



-4-
2.09      Wherever possible INCORA uses other entities to help with its
development activities; in Caqueta it uses and will continue to use local
consultants and contractors for road construction, banks such as CAJA and
the Banco Ganadero (BANCO) for credit facilities, and the Ministry of Agri-
culture for crop and livestock experimentation.
C. Credit and Credit Institutions
2.10      Agricultural Credit:  Detailed information on agricultyral credit
is in Annex 2. The demand for credit is high, but the institutional supply
probably reaches only about 30% of farmers, and is rarely adequate for their
needs.  Only about one-fourth of institutional credit is advanced after de-
tailed technical appraisal; much of the rest is given for seasonal loans as
fixed amounts per hectare for the main crops.
2.11      At the end of 1968 the agricultural portfolio of the banks (includ-
ing CAJA) was about Ps 5.3 billion, or 35% of their total investment portfo-
lio. This was higher than agriculture's contribution to GDP of about 30%.
Of the agricultural portfolio, CAJA held 58%, BANCO 11%, and the other 23
banks 31% between them. Fifty-four percent of these loans were in the live-
stock sector.
2.12      Agricultural loan periods vary from up to one year for seasonal
loans to a maximum of 7 years for livestock, 10 years for tree crops and
15 years for permanent installations. Security for seasonal loais is
usually a lien on the crops being produced. Security for longer term
loans is frequently a mortgage on the farm and equipment, which in the case
of livestock includes the animals and their progeny. Additionally, all banks
insist on an insurance policy on the farmer covering life and permanent dis-
ability, the premium being 1% a year on the loan balances outstanding.
2.13      For non-agricultural lending, the general interest rate is- 14%
and more a year, depending on the risk. In agriculture, the maximum rates
permitted by the Monetary Board for banks start at 10% a year for loans of
one year or less, increasing to a maximum of 14.5% for loans of 10 years
and over. CAJA's rates are lower; 9% short term, 11% medium term and 12%
long term, with short and medium term loans of below Ps 5,000 charged at
1% less. Loans supported by credit from external sources may carry special
rates; for example, the rate for the Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 624-CO)s
is 12% a year, and for the USAID Supervised Credit loan, 8%.
2.14      CAJA:  Detailed information on CAJA is in Annex 3.  It was created
in 1931 to provide credit to farmers unable to obtain it elsewhere. Later
CAJA also became responsible for credit to small industry and mines. Apart
from providing credit it operates a supplies department, which is an impor-
tant factor in supplying farmers with seasonal inputs and farm machinery.



It also provides savings and insurance facilities, and administers some
Government agricultural development projects lI. It supplies banking and
accounting services for some of INCORA's credit programs 2/. Its 10-man
Board of Directors includes the Minister of Agriculture as Chairman, and
representatives of the President of the Republic, Central Bank, Coffee
Growers' Federation and Farmers' Association. The General Manager, nominated
by the Board, is assisted by five deputies.
2.15      CAJA's paid-up share capital was Ps 540 million at the end of 1969,
of which 82% was held by Government and 12% by the Coffee Growers' Federation.
Net profits have risen from Ps 5 million in 1965 to Ps 34 million in 1969, and
reserves from Ps 151 million to Ps 363 million in the same period. Its total
investment portfolio of Ps 3.8 billion at the end of 1969 was about one-fourth
of the portfolio for all banks. Almost half its portfolio is in the livestock
subsector. It has special discounting facilities with the Central Bank up to
Ps 1.9 billion. Overdue loans average about 12% but most are repaid within
the next year. The bad debt write off each year is less than 0.01%, which is
satisfactory.
2.16      BANCO:  More detailed information on BANCO is in Annex 3.  It was
established in 1956 mainly to provide credit for livestock. Like CAJA, it
also participates in INCORA's credit programs. Its 5-man Board includes one
representative each of the President of the Republic and the Minister of
Agriculture, and the rest private shareholders.
2.17      BANCO's paid-up share capital is Ps 264 million, of which about
30% is held by Government, 4% by CAJA and the rest by private investors.
Net profit 1965 through 1968 was about Ps 6 million a year, but was Ps 8
million in 1969. Its investment portfolio was almost Ps 1 billion at the
end of 1969, representing about 11% of the total agricultural portfolio.
Over three-fourths of the portfolio is for livestock, the balance mainly
for agricultural marketing and processing. Overdue loans (more than 3 months)
at the end of each year is about 5.7% and the bad debt write off each year is
less than 0.5% of its loan portfolio, which is satisfactory.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Physical Features
3.01      Introduction:  The project area consists of about one million ha
in the Intendencia of Caqueta in south-east Colombia on the frontier of the
Amazon forests; these stretch eastwards from the Andes (see Map 1). Estab-
lished settlement areas form a band about 30 km wide and about 200 km long
running along the foothills of the mountains, centered on Florencia, the
main town.
1/   Including the two Livestock Development Projects (Bank Loans 448-CO
and 651-CO).
2/   Including the Agricultural Credit Project (Bank Loan 624-CO).



-6-
3.02      Soils and Vegetation:  Tropical rain forest, except where cleared
for settlement, covers the area. Soils are derived from the weathering of
the Andes Cordillera and are acid and rather low in nutrients. Soil data
are available from a reconnaissance survey made in 1965 1/. Exoept for limited
areas of alluvials, soils are generally not suited to sustained'annual crop-
ping, although they adequately support a rice crop in the first year after
forest clearing, and permanent pastures thereafter.
3.03      Climate:  The climate is humid and tropical, with an even temper-
ature of about 260C. A well distributed rainfall, of about 3,800 mm annually,
sustains'pasture and crop growth without interruption, but the months of
December to February are dry enough to permit cutting and burning of the
forest.
3.04      Topography, Drainage and Hydrology:  Lying about 600 meters above
sea level, the project area is dissected by numerous rivers which arise in
the mountains and flow southeast into the Amazon basin. The topography is
gently rolling with slopes rarely too steep for pastures although at times
difficult for continued cereal cropping. The 1965 reconnaissance survey
showed that less than 7% of the area is badly drained and inundated land,
that about another 10% is subject to irregular flooding. In most places
groundwater is obtained at a depth of 4 meters, and all streams and rivers
have a good volume of water throughout the year.
3.05      Communications:  Entry to the project area from Bogota-is south
to Garzon and then east over the western scarp of the Andes by 100 km of
mountainous road to Florencia. A road along the foothills links Florencia
to San Jose in the south and Puerto Rico in the north and provides the main
access to the developed area (see Map 2); there are no bridges over some of
the main rivers, and although several stretches of the road are paved with
asphalt from locally occurring deposits, the general standard of the road is
poor. Financial provision for improving this road has been included in the
recent highway loan to Colombia (680-CO), and work should be completed over
the next 3 years.
3.06      To assist land settlement in Caqueta, penetration roads have been
built outwards from the main access road (see Map 2). This construct-Lon was
initiated by CAJA and continued by INCORA, using local consultants for design
and local contractors for execution. Workmanship has been satisfactory.
3.07      Rivers are important local communication routes within the develop-
ing area. The most important are the Caguan, Guayas, San Petro and Orte-
guaza rivers, which flow into the Amazon system.  There are daily commercial.
air services from Bogota to Florencia. There are also many airstrips suita-
ble for light aircraft.

B. Past Development and Present Situation
3.08      Historical:  Florencia was founded during the Amazon rubber boom
early in this century, and areas close to the new town were soon developed
for rice and beef production. Settlers were stimulated to move to the
area as the knowledge spread that they could take possession of apparently
unlimited public lands. Also, population pressure and soil erosion problems
in the neighboring mountainous areas of Huila and Cauca accelerated movement
to Caqueta.  The 1951 census in Caqueta counted 41,000 inhabitants, that in
1964 some 103,000, and the present population is estimated at over 160,000.
Population is growing at 8% annually (about 13,000) of which 3.2% is local
increase and 4.8% immigration.
3.09      Official support for directed colonization in Caqueta began in
1959 under the auspices of the CAJA, but was not successful, primarily due
to the poor selection of settlers but also because of inadequate supervi-
sion and credit. Meanwhile spontaneous settlement continued, and as roads
and communications were improved and supervised credit became available,
the influx of settlers increased; the inflow of new families to Caqueta in
1969 was about 1,200.
3.10      Settlement is spreading to the southeast into the Amazon basin,
following roads and rivers along which produce can be marketed (see Map 2).
Settlement and forest clearing is negligible in remote areas without imme-
diate access to the river banks. This is clearly demonstrated in Map 3,
which shows the actual development, as at September 1969, in one of the main
project areas; a lack of roads is the principal limiting factor to settlement
in Caqueta.
3.11      Settlers arrive on their own initiative and usually work as hired
laborers for established farmers or timber operators. After one or two years
they send for their families and set out for the frontiers of settlement;
there they start forest clearing, establish their rice and subsistence crops,
and follow these by pasture establishment and the introduction of cattle.
The main determinant of farm size (30 to 250 ha) is the area the settler
manages to clear in the first five years. In the fifth year, he is given
a permanent land title to twice the area he has cleared. This method of
land allocation is cheap and also has the advantage of roughly tailoring
the size of holding to the settler's abilities.
3.12      Land Use and Farming Systems:  The most valuable trees are ex-
tracted by independent sawmillers before the settler enters the zone; as
the jungle is progressively cleared, the remaining millable timber is
felled and hand sawn by the settler, or by arrangement withi a contractor.
All other trees and shrubs are then cut and the debris burned in the dry
season.  Shortly afterwards rice is planted between the stumps and unburnt
trunks; little weeding is necessary and locally harvested grass seed is
broadcast under the rice crop. The average settler clears 5 to 10 ha
annually for rice production, and establishes about two hectares of sub-
sistence crops (cassava, plantain, sugarcane) in the first year of settle-
ment.



- 8 -
3.13      This pattern is repeated over 5 to 10 years until the whole farm
is cleared and in pasture, except for about 15 ha retained for foodcrops
and managed on the basis of shifting cultivation. Pasture is ready for
grazing six to nine months after the rice harvest' fencing is then erected,
and cattle introduced. Normally a few pigs are kept on free range around
the house lots and fed on cassava, maize and plantain from the subsistence
area; pigs are a most important source of income in the early years of
settlement but pig-keeping is abandoned as the cattle enterprise becomes
established because settlers prefer to work with cattle. A low cost system
of land development has thus evolved which is well within the capability of
the average settler. Although the present svstem has not led to problems
of erosion or shortages of timber and firewood, in the future INCORA intends
to reserve 20% of the forest areas for purposes other than agriculture (see
para 4.20).
3.14      Land Tenure:  All unoccupied land in the project areais public
land. Law 135 of 1961 charges INCORA with developing this unoccupied land
and sets out the regulations for granting land title. The land is first
assigned under a written contract which stipulates; that the settler must
develop half of the farm within five years, that he cannot transfer his
land without permission from the Government, and that he must participate
in a life insurance program to cover the repayment of any borrowings in the
event of his death or total disability (see Annex 4). Provided the settler
complies with these obligations, he is allotted a final title after the
five year period. A small staff of INCORA surveyors, headed by a lawyer,
arrange for the survey and legalization of contracts and titles; during the
last six years 5,714 titles have been issued in Caqueta.
3.15      Credit:  Details of agricultural credit in Caqueta are in Annex 2.
INCORA has two main programs operating in the area, one for general agricul-
ture, in association with CAJA, and the other for livestock, in association
with BANCO. Their objective is to provide development loans, coupled with
appropriate technical assistance, to farmers possessing enough land and
manpower to operate a minimum viable farm unit, but having no access to
other sources of credit on commercial terms. No farmer can stay in the
programs for more than 10 years. Those who have satisfactorily repaid
their loans within this period are given graduation certificates by INCORA.
Although at graduation they may still be repaying program loans, they are
considered capable of obtaining further credit for working capital or
investmdnt in the commercial credit market, where interest rates are higher.
3.16      Farmers may obtain separate loans under both programs- but the
maximum is Ps 80,000 per farmer covering about 60% of developmnent costs.
Loans are given for periods up to one year for subsistence, 2 years for
seasonal farm inputs and land rents, 7 years for machinery, breeding livestodk
and semi-permanent crops and 15 vears for Permanent installations.



- 9 -
3.17      On loans above five years, a grace period of three years or more
is allowed. The nominal interest rate is 8% but since 1969 interest charges
during the grace period have been waived, reducing the real rate on loans of
over seven years to around 5%. Security is a lien on crops for loans of up
to two years, and a mortgage on the farm and livestock for longer loans. In
every case life insurance is required, with the premium calculated at 1% on
the outstanding loan balance.
3.18      Over the 6-year period 1964 through 1969, a total of about 3,500
farmers have received program loans to a value of about Ps 110 million,
an average of about Ps 31,500 per loan. The two programs have been reasonably
successful, but two factors have limited their scope. The first has been
the shortage of funds allocated to them; funds reached a peak of Ps 34 million
in 1967, but declined to Ps 24 million in 1969, with corresponding decreases
in the number of new loans. At the end of 1969 some 200 applications were
deferred, awaiting 1970 funds. This has discouraged some potential settlers.
The second factor is that the current five year period for livestock breeding
loans, which includes a grace period of three years, is too short and does
not allow for repayment out of the sales of progeny.
3.19      Under the general credit program, CAJA acts as INCORA's agent only,
providing banking and administrative services for a fee of 1% a year on loan
balances outstanding. INCORA takes the bad debts risk. At mid-1969, 86%
of loan repayments due had been made by maturity dates, compared with INCORA's
countrywide average of 82%; of the balance, about half were rescheduled for
delayed repayments. Only about 2% are expected to be ultimately written off
as bad debts. Under the livestock credit program, BANCO assesses the credit-
worthiness of applicants, operates the program account and accepts the credit
risk; its fee is 4% of the loan balances outstanding. BANCO's bad debt
writeoff each year is less than 0.5% of its investment portfolio, which is
satisfactory.
3.20      Marketing:  The main products of the area are beef, pork and rice;
approximately half is consumed in Caqueta and the balance exported to Bogota,
Cali and intermediate towns between them and Florencia, where large outlets
for these products exist (see Annex 5).
3.21      Beef and pork are purchased from farmers by local middlemen who
make up truck loads and trans-ship to wholesalers in the consumer centers.
About 75% of the rice crop is bought by local millers and the remainder by
the Instituto de Mercadeo Agricola (IDEMA). IDEMA helps to stabilize prices
by purchasing part of the rice crop at previously agreed prices, and also by
providing storage for some 16,500 tons of cereals in Florencia. There are
eight rice mills in Florencia with a combined milling capacity of 16,000 tons
of paddy montlhly and this is sufficient to handle the present and anticipated
production in Caqueta.
3.22      Health and Education:  It is socially and economically important
that the whole family resides on the holding, and while Caqueta has economic
attractions for the prospective settler, he is more likely to settle down
permanently with his family if reasonable health and education facilities
are provided. Over the last five years INCORA has organized the construction
of 130 primary schools on a self help basis, and has built health centers in
the new settlement areas. Adequate staff, and these have been made available.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
4.01      The project would be the second phase of the land colonization
program in Caqueta. It would be based on the existing simple ankd proven
system of settlement and agricultural development producing rice, pork and
beef (see paras 3.11 to 3.13).  It would be developed over a 3-year period
and would consist of:
(a) design and construction of 380 km of penetration and
access roads to:
(i) service some 3,500 partially established settlers;
and
(ii) open up 280,000 ha of undeveloped land for a
further 2,800 new settlers.
(b) provision of credit for farm development to:
(i) 3,500 partially established settlers; of whom
2,000 are already in receipt of a limited amount
of credit and 1,500 have not yet participated in
the credit scheme; and
(ii)  1,000 of the 2,800 new settlers expected to move
into the project area during the development period.
(c) strengthening the INCORA administration at Caqueta.
(d) construction of 90 primary schools and six health centers.
4.02      The project would be administered by INCORA, and farm credit.
would be channelled through CAJA and BANCO.
B. Detailed Components
4.03      Phasing of Settlement and Farm Development:  Good road communica-
tions are essential not only for effective agricultural development, but also
for the efficient issue and administration of credit. In the initial year of
the project, emphasis would be on the provision of credit to existing INCORA
clients and to partially established settlers on the fringes of the present
development area. As the road program develops, more new settlers would be
serviced. The proposed phasing would be as follows:

/1   Recent experience has shown that only about 45% of farmers in actively
developing areas apply for credit; no major change in the pattern of
borrowing is expected during the project period.
4.04      Road Development:  140 km of penetration roads and 240 km of access
roads would be constructed on five main fronts to open up undeveloped areas
for settlement, and to give access to areas of production which have deve-
loped along river banks but which are now isolated (see Map 2).
4.05      Three types of roads would be built according to the following
standards found satisfactory at Caqueta: 110 km of Class B penetration
roads (6 meter embankment and 4 meters gravel); 30 km of Class B/C penetra-
tion roads (5 meter embankment and 4 meters gravel); 240 km of Class C farm
access roads (4 meter embankment and 3 meters of gravel where necessary).
Three ferries, one at Valparaiso, and two on the Rio Guayas, would be in-
stalled (see Map 2). Under the guidance of INCORA, farmers would clear
subsidiary tracks from their farms to the nearest access road.
4.06      Credit:  Project credit would be administered in a similar way to
the current programs (para 3.16), with INCORA establishing settler's credit
requirements. CAJA would disburse seasonal credit, and BANC0 longer term
development credit. CAJA has seven bramches in the project area, sufficient
to handle satisfactorily settlers' short-term credit requirements. BANCO
has only one branch in the area, in Florencia, but this would be adequate
for handling medium and long term credit.
4.07      The main requirements for a borrower to qualify for credit would
be that he has:
(a) no easy access to sources of commercial credit;
(b) at least 5 ha of land cleared and under cultivation;
(c) a farm of between 30 and 250 ha;



- 12 -
(d)  a written contract of possession or a farm title;
(e)  agreed to accept INCORA's supervision of his farm's
development as set out in the farm plan;
(f)  been assessed as creditworthy by BANCO.
4.08      An INCORA credit officer would draw up farm plans in consultation
with the settler. The loan application would include the plan, a statement
of the settler's financial position, and the estimated impact of the loan on
the farm cash flow to show the settler's ability to meet loan repayments and
interest charges.
4.09      INCORA's project director would be responsible for approving
loan applications, which would then be forwarded to BANCO for a credit-
worthiness appraisal of the applicants. BANCO's assessment of creditwor-
thiness would be accepted by both INCORA and CAJA. BANCO and CAJA would
each retain a copy of the approved loan application and would make loan
disbursements according to its schedule.
4.10      Normally CAJA would supply seasonal credit for rice production
(seeds, fertilizer, hand tools etc.) in kind from its own supply depots. It
would supply credit for living expenses in cash, in accordance with a standard
payment schedule. For medium and long term loans, BANCO would pay suppliers'
bills when satisfied the goods had been delivered. For livestock the settler
could buy from any seller, with BANCO approval, but he would normally buy
through BANCO's own livestock purchase scheme (Annex 2 para 17).
4.11      Seasonal credit requirements are given in Annex 2, Tables 6 to 8.
Such credit would not exceed Ps 14,000 per settler each year. It would be
required annually for 3 to 7 years, depending on the farm's state of develop-
ment. The interest rate would be 8% a year. Security would be a lien on
the crops to be produced, together with life assurance on the settler at 1%
a year on the sum advanced. Repayment of the total sum advanced would be
due immediately after harvest.
4.12      Medium and long term loan requirements are given in Annex 2,
Tables 6 to 8. Loans to individual settlers would vary, depending on the
farm's state of development. Average establishment costs and loans by type
of settler are as follows:

A:  Partly established settlers, currently receiving credit.
B:  Partly established settlers, currently not receiving credit.
C: New settlers.
4.13      Repayment periods would vary according to the type of settler.  As
the main long term enterprise would be beef production, new settlers would
require longer grace periods than established settlers. Repayment schedules
would be as follows:
Period (in years) of               Loan        Grace        Repayment
Settlers, Type A                           7           3             4
Settlers, Type B                           9           5             4
Settlers, Type C                          12           7             5
In general, by the time repayments of long term loans become due, settlers
would be sufficiently established not to require further short term credit
(Annex 2, Tables 6 to 8). Thus there should be no conflict of interest be-
tween CAJA and BANCO over the priority of loan repayments.
4.14      BANCO's security would be a lien over the livestock and its
progeny, and life insurance on the farmer. As INCORA controls the transfer
of land (Annex 4 para 3 (a)) and has the right of possession, it would use
these powers to reinforce BANCO's security.
4.15      Interest Rate:  The proposed interest rate of 8% a year on both
seasonal and long term project loans would be lower than the 12% of the
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 624-CO), in which well established medium
sized farmers are farming some of the best land in Colombia, and can afford
to pay the rate. Interest rates on medium and long term loans made by CAJA
and commercial banks usually range between 9% and 12%, reaching 14-1/2% in a
few cases (para 2.14). The rates to settlers under the present Caqueta
settlement program are 8% short term and about 5% long term. The present
project rate represents an increase of 3% for long term loans over the
prevailing rate at Caqueta, but with inflation currently approaching 7%
it would represent a real rate of just over 1%. Settlers at Caqueta re-
ceiving loans under this project would be either new to the area or in



- 14 -
the early years of developing their farms from heavy tropical forest. The
cash flow estimates (Annex 2, Tables 2 to 4) show that the proposed rate of
8%, although higher than those now prevailing, can be met by new settlers.
However, any higher rate is likely to prove a disincentive to borrowing
and thus to the development of new agricultural land at a relatively low
cost to Government (para 8.03). In the circumstances this subsidized rate
of interest is justified.
4.16      Health and Education:  The project would result in a need for
10,000 primary school places. These would be provided by constructing
90 schools of standard design on a self-help basis; settlers would provide
labor and rough timber, INCORA the supervision, roofing material and inter-
nal fittings (Annex 7). INCORA has organized the building of 130 schools in
Caqueta over the last five years, and the new program, spread eXvenly over
three years, would not present organizational problems.
4.17      Two health centers, of a design similar to existing centers, would
be erected annually at strategic points throughout the project area. In
project cost estimates, provision, has also been made for the beds and equip-
ment needed for each center.
4.18      In the past, INCORA has contracted successfully with the Ministries
of Health and Education to supply and finance staff for schools and health
centers constructed in its projects.  These arrangements would continue,
and assurances were obtained during negotiations that contracts would be
signed between INCORA and the Ministries of Health and Education requiring
the latter to supply adequate staff and recurrent finance for the operation
of the new health centers and schools in the project area. Assurances
were also obtained that all primary school children in the project area
would have the opportunity of a full primary education.
4.19      Research:  Under the project 100 hectares would be acquired by
INCORA at Bodoquero for the development of the rice and pasture research
programs that are essential for improving productivity in the area (see
Annex 8). Such research would be undertaken by the Instituto Colombiano
Agropecuario (ICA), under contract to INCORA, the former providing
qualified professional staff and the latter, the necessary equipment and
recurrent finance. This system works successfully in other INCORA project areas.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a suitable contract would
be signed between INCORA and ICA covering a 3-year research program.
4.20      Forest Reserves:  The past policies of colonization in Caqueta have
not led to erosion problems nor to shortages of millable timber or firewood.
In future, nonetheless, INCORA intends to demarcate forest reserve areas to
ensure future supplies of timber and firewood, to temper the ecological changes
associated with the clearing of natural forest areas and to preserve wild life.
With these purposes in view, INCORA will survey the forest in advance of
colonisation and will set aside specific areas more suited to silviculture
than to agriculture. It is estimated that 20% of the new colonisation areas
will he allocated for this purpose.

5.02      A contingency of 10% is included in administration, vehicle,
building and road costs. The estimated foreign exchange cost of 50% for
road construction is based on recent experience of the Banks' Transportation
Projects Department and takes into account the higher equipment usage for
construction in this terrain. Road construction costs are based on the
final engineering plans for the first years road program which have been
approved by the Bank.

5.04      Settlers would provide Ps 122.4 million (32%) and Government would
provide the balance, Ps 266.0 million (68%), obtaining Ps 145.7 million (38%)
from the proposed Bank loan, and the rest, Ps 120.3 million (30%), from its own
resources. INCORA would handle the whole of the Ps 266.0 million on behalf of
Government in a separate project account (para 5.07), and utilize these funds
as follows:
(a) Farm investments: Ps 75.0 million would be lent to BANCO at
4% interest a year, with BANCO taking the credit risk, and on-
lending to settlers at 8% (para 4.14). Interest earned from on-
lending to BANCO would be credited to the project account, as
would BANCO repayments. The schedule for such repayments would
be related to settlers' repayment programs. A condition of effect-
iveness of the Bank loan is the signature of a subsidiary loan
agreement, acceptable to the Bank and covering the above points,
between INCORA and BANCO.
(b) Seasonal inputs: Ps 31.8 million would be advanced through CAJA,
which would act as INCORA's agent in disbursing seasonal credits.
CAJA would provide banking and administrative services for a fee
of 1% per year on loans made, with INCORA taking the credit risk.
A condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan is the signature
of an agreement, acceptable to the Bank and covering the above
points, between INCORA and CAJA.
(c) Other project items: Ps 159.2 million for administration,
vehicles, equipment, buildings and road development, would
be channelled through the project account, with INCORA making
and receiving payments as appropriate.
5.05      Bank Loan:  The proposed loan of US$8.1 million (Ps 146 million)
would finance about 38% of project costs.  It would cover the whole of the
US$5.5 million foreign exchange component, plus US$2.6 million of local costs.
Government would be the borrower and would bear the exchange risk and would
Day into the project account loan funds as disbursed.  Government would
advance the US$2.92 million for farm investments to INCORA as a 30 year
loan, on which it would charge 4% a year interest; it would advance the
remainder (US$5.18 million) for vehicles, equipment, buildings and road
development as i grant. Government would repay the Bank loan over 20 years,
including a grace period of four years.
5.06      Government Funds:  Project funds made available to INCORA by Govern-
ment, Ps 120.3 million, would come in two forms. Ps 54.3 million for farm
investments and seasonal credits would come from 30 year loans from the
Government to INCORA, on which it would charge 4% a year interest. The re-
mainder, Ps 66.0 million, for vehicles, equipment, buildings and road deve-
lopment, would be a grant. Funds would be paid into the project account as
required. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government
would provide the above, and any balance necessary to meet the full cost of
the project.



- i7s -
C. Accounts and Audit
5.07      Project Account:  INCORA would maintain a separate project account,
which would cover all project items and show all project transactions made
by INCORA with funds provided by the Bank and Government. It would contain
separate sub-accounts for farm investments, seasonal inputs, administration,
vehicles and equipment, buildings, and road development. The first two would
show interest received and paid out as well as loan advances and repaymenits.
5.08      BANCO and CAJA Accounts:  BANCO and CAJA would each maintain a
separate account to show payments received and paid out on behalf of the
project. A clause to cover this would be included in the agreements be-
tween them and INCORA (para 5.04).
5.09      Audit:  INCORA's main project account would be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and assurances were
obtained at negotiations to this effect. The BANCO and CAJA project accounts
would be audited annually by the Superintendent of Banks.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
5.10      Procurement:  Settlers would obtain their supplies for long term
farm investment (excluding livestock) through normal commercial channels.
For livestock, settlers would be able to buy from any seller with BANCO
approval, or through the BANCO's own livestock purchase scheme (para 4.10).
Seasonal inputs would be provided through CAJA's own supply depots or other
suitable organization in Caqueta. Vehicles and equipment would be obtained
by INCORA through its usual local competitive bidding procedures. Schools
would be built on a self help basis with material supplied by INCORA and
procured through local competitive bidding. Health centers would be
constructed by small local contractors, selected through INCORA's local
bidding procedures. The procurement of a large number of relatively small
items by numerous buyers for a project of this nature cannot be done
satisfactorily through international bidding procedures. The procedures
of both INCORA and CAJA for local procurement, and supplies offered by local
commercial channels, are adequate to ensure competitively priced goods and
supplies for the project.
5.11      Engineering consultants would design the roads and prepare contract
documents. During negotiations agreement was reached that INCORA personnel
would supervise t-e construction of the roads.  v            INWA woula empioy

- 19 -
work and assurances were obtained during negotiations to this effect. Many
experienced Colombian contractors are available, and it is expected that all
contracts would be won by local companies.
5.12      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a)  INCORA would provide annually, three months in advance, details
of the following year's construction program for the Bank's
concurrence; and
(b)  adequate maintenance of roads would be undertaken by the
Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales, an autonomous agency
for feeder roads responsible to the Minister of Public Works.
5.13      Disbursement:  Disbursement of the Bank loan would be at the rate of
70% of the amount in the proJect account for farm investment, vehicles and equip-
ment, buildings and road development.  Disbursements would be against statements
of expenditure submitted by INCORA on behalf of Government and supported by
normal documentation. Disbursement claims for farm investments would be sup-
ported by certified data from BANCO. Claims for road construction would be
certified by the engineering consultants and INCORA. Annex 11, Table 2 shows
the estimated disbursement of the Bank loan.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Policy and Coordination
6.01      INCORA would be responsible for project administration and manage-
ment. Its senior adminstrative, executive and legal representative is the
General Manager, to whom the project director would be directly responsible.
A project coordinator would be appointed to INCORA's Division of Legal Affairs
in Bogota, during the development period.
6.02      INCORA's present system of policy control and coordination is
satisfactory. However, since colonization has become an important part of
its operations, it proposes to establish a colonization section in Bogota.
Colonization project directors would be responsible to the head of this
section, instead of directly, as now, to the General Manager. If the pro-
posed new arrangement is introduced it is likely to be satisfactory for
project implementation but, during negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government and INCORA that no change would be made in current
arrangements for Caqueta without the prior concurrence of the Bank.



- 20 -
B. Project Organization
6.03      Field operations would he controlled by a Project Director in
Florencia, who would be the INCORA official now in charge of the first
phase of the Caqueta program. The present incumbent is highly competent.
He would be supported by a Deputy Director, who would be responsible for
day-to-day project activities through section heads dealing respectivelv
with credit, accounting, land registration, technical services and roads.
Assurances were obtained durine negotiations that during disbursement of
the Bank loan, anv future appointments to the post of Project Director would
only be made after consultation with the Bank.
6.04      The chief of the credit section would be responsible for lending
operations and extension services to farmers, and would have administra-
tive control of zone chiefs (10) and credit supervisors (70).  Each credit
supervisor would be responsible for about 50 farmers at any one time and
past experience in Caqueta has shown this to be sufficient for efficient
operation.
6.05      The roads will be designed by consultants and construction will be
carried out by contractors. INCORA staff will supervise the execution of
these works, but a firm of consulting engineers will assist INCORA in its
supervision activities (see para 5.11).
6.06      An experienced lawyer would head the land registration section,
and his staff of 8 surveyors and their associates would be responsible for
the survey of farms for title and for the issue of relevant documents. To
prevent delays in the issue of titles, all land registration work would
continue to be finalized in Florencia and not in Bogota. A team of this
size would be able to process a minimum of 2,000 titles annually.
6.07      Four experienced technicians - one agronomist and three veterin-
arians - would be directly responsible to the Deputy Director for general
technical advice on farming activities; they would also work closely with
the zone chiefs and credit supervisors in the preparation of farm and
credit plans.
C. Staff Requirements and Availability
6.08      The staff requirements for each project year are at Annex 9,
Table 3. At present, INCORA has surplus staff due to some curtailment
of its general activities, and most of the existing staff at Caqueta would
become redundant within the next two years if further credit and develop-
ment finance was not made available.  In addition to the staff which would
be available in Caqueta, the project would require some additional recruit-
ment; importantly a deputy director, two veterinarians, two agriculturalists,



- 21 -
four zone chiefs, a lawyer and 20 credit supervisors. No difficulties are
foreseen in recruiting these personnel.
D. Selection of Settlers
6.09      Based on the census data referred to in Chapter III, the annual
expected increase of new settler families in the project area is estimated
at 2,800 over the next three years, provided access roads are constructed.
About 45% of new settlers are expected to come from local families, and
the balance from the over-crowded highland areas.
6.10      There would be no formal selection of settlers since the area is
open to any wishing to farm there; once settlers arrive, however, a natural
selection based on survival capabilities would occur. Compared with the
one attempt at highly organized and expensive settlement, where wastage of
settlers was as high as 70%, this natural system of selection is superior.
It does not involve Government in the cost of moving prospective settlers
from distant areas, or in the cost of transit camps and preliminary sub-
sistence for such settlers; the onus is on the settler himself to make the
initial effort and investment, and having done so, he makes a greater
effort to support this with continued hard work.
6.11      Those settlers who seek credit from INCORA are again self-
selected in that they must first clear five hectares of jungle on their
own initiative, and demonstrate to BANCO that they are a reasonable credit
risk. Thus there would be little likelihood that proceeds of the Bank loan
would be onlent to unsatisfactory settlers.
VII. YIELDS, OUTPUTS, MARKETS AND PRICES, FARM INCOME AND
GOVERNMENT REVENUES
7.01      Yields and Outputs:  Yields used in project calculations are
those now achieved by local farmers. Rice yields of 1,000 kg/ha were
verified by a recent INCORA survey; steer weights of 450 kg and cow weights
of 355 kg were calculated from records at the Florencia weighbridge. Pig
weights were calculated from local air consignments and other records in
Florencia.
7.02      Rice and pork production would be of primary importance in the
earlier years of development, but gradually would give way to beef which
would be the major product at project maturity. Project rice production
would reach a maximum of about 29,U00 tons in project year four, pork a
maximum of 28,000 head (2,000 tons) in year four and beef 34,000 head
(14,000 tons) in year 18 (Annex 5). The annual value of production at
maturity (year 12) is estimated at US$5.0 million.



- 22 -
7.03      Markets and Prices:  Although Colombia exports small amounts of
rice and beef, project production would be either consumed locally in
Caqueta, or transported to areas south of Bogota and east of Cali. The
demand for these products in these markets is estimated to be increasing
at 8 to 10% annually. In Caqueta, production would only be able to meet
the increased demand for rice and pork in existing markets for the next
five years. Beef production in Caqueta would not outrun demand in exist-
ing markets until about project year 8 and the surplus thereafter would be
very small and disposable elsewhere (Annex 5).
7.04      Anticinating a possible decline in meat prices, farm gKate prices
used in project calculations for beef and pork are 10% below present prices
(Annex 5). Farm gate prices used for rice, however, are about the same as
at present; a price decline is not expected since the use of varieties
with better milling characteristics could increase farm gate values by as
much as 20%. Farm gate prices used in project calculations are as follows:
Steers    Ps 4.45 per kg live weight   Pork   Ps 6.65 per kg live weight
Cows      Ps 4.25 per kg live weight   Rice   Ps 1.10 per kg of paddy
7.05      Farm Incomes:  Details of farm budgets appear in Annex 2.  The
annual net income at maturity of a typical project farm would be about Ps 18,000
(US$1,000); and if the value of subsistence consumption is taken into account
about US$1,250. Government considers it of importance that project farm incomes
should be well above subsistence level, but not excessive.
7.06      Government Revenues:  Direct revenues accruing from the project
would be fairly substantial. Principal sources of revenue would be municipal
land taxes and Government livestock slaughter and capital asset taxes (Annex 12).
Estimated revenues are Ps 4.3 million in year 5, Ps 8.6 million in year 10, and
Ps 9.5 million annually (US$ 0.5 million) from year 15 onwards.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project would directly benefit 6,300 farming families in the
Caqueta Intendencia by enabling them to develop economic holdings on previ-
ously unexploited land, and to obtain satisfactory incomes. Development
brought about by the project would generate additional non-farm employment
opportunities in the project area, and it is estimated that an overall
total of nearly 8,000 families or 55,000 people would benefit. The ratio
of farm to urban families in the project area is about 3:1.
8.02      Using the farm gate prices in Chapter VIII, and asstuning a 20-year
project life, the internal economic rate of return from investment in the
project would be 16.5% (see Annex 13). As unemployment and under-employment
in Colombia is increasing by an estimated 100,000 persons each vear, no
value has been attributed to farm family labor. Variations in firm gate
valt'es would affect the rate of return as follows:



- 23 -
Farm Gate Values             Rate of Return
+ 20%                         21%
+ 10%                         19%
- 10%                        14%
- 20%                        11%
8.03      The project would have substantial social benefits insofar as
it would help correct the present imbalance in Colombia's agrarian struc-
ture at a relatively low cost to the Colombian economy. As Colombia is
faced with a formidable agrarian problem, the development of low-cost
settlement.l/ is of considerable importance and the experience gained from
the project would be invaluable in planning and implementing similar
projects elsewhere in Colombia.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  suitable contracts would be signed between INCORA and the
Ministries of Health and Education to ensure the supply of
adequate staff and recurrent finance for the operation of
the new schools and health centers in the project area (para 4.18);
(b) Government would provide sufficient funds to meet its share
of the project costs (para 5.06);
(c) INCORA would employ a firm of engineering consultants, acceptable
to the Bank, to assist in analysing bids, to advise on supervision
procedures and to certify that road works are carried out according
to plans and specifications (para 5.11);
(d) INCORA would provide annually, three months in advance, details
of the following year's construction program for the Bank's
concurrence (para 5.12);
1/ Comparative settlement costs per family in some other Bank financed
projects are as follows:
US$
a)  Colombia - Caqueta                                         2,200
b)  Kenya    - Land Settlement (303-KE)                        3,000
c)  Colombia - Atlantico Irrigation (502-CO)                  10,000
d)  Malaysia - Jengka Triangle (I) (533-MA)                   10,000
e)  Trinidad - Crown Lands (dairy section) (486-TR)           20,000
f)  Peru     - San Lorenzo (418-PE)                           30,000



- 24 -
(e) adequate maintenance of roads would be undertaken by the
Fondo Nacionale de Caminos Vecinales (para 5.12).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness are that:
(a)  an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, will be signed between
INCORA and BANCO covering their duties and responsibilities in
providing long term credit to project farmers (para 5.04 (a));
(b)  an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, will be signed between
INCORA and CAJA covering the duties and responsibilities of
these parties in providing seasonal credit (para 5.04 (b)).
9.03      The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.1 million
for a term of 20 years.

ANNEX 1
COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA)
Objectives
1.        The Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) is an auto-
nomous Government institution established under the Agrarian Reform Law 135
of 1961, to reform the agrarian social structure of Colombia. Much land is
inequitably concentrated in the hands of relatively few people, while at the
other extreme many smallholders are trying to farm land which is too small
in area to be profitable. INCORA is responsible for bringing these two
extremes closer together. Where large and potentially cultivable areas of
agricultural land are being left uncultivated, or are being wastefully or
inadequately used, INCORA is authorized to buy and develop them. INCORA
is also responsible for increasing production and productivity in rural
areas, particularly by making credit and technical services readily avail-
able to smallholders.
Operations
2.        In pursuit of these objectives, INCORA has developed a wide range
of projects including land reclamation, irrigation, land acquisition and sub-
sequent sub-division, the colonization of unpopulated areas and the consoli-
dation of uneconomic smallholdings. It has encouraged the issue of land
titles to give farmers security of tenure and to ensure their eligibility
for credit. It has introduced supervised credit and technical assistanlce
to subsistence smallholders to help develop them into commercial producers.
Its activities comprise 42 projects located throughout the country (Map 1).
Of these, about 30% are concerned mainly with land reclamation and irriga-
tion, 40% with farm improvement and supervised credit, and the balance of
30% with colonization. The Bank/FAO mission which visited Colombia in 1967
to evaluate INCORA's operations, found that it was run in a creditable man-
ner under progressive leadership.
Administration and Management
3.        Under INCORA's constitution, directors are chosen so that the
Board reflects broad political parity. The Minister of Agriculture is
Chairman, and the 16-man Board includes representatives of ICA, CAJA,
IDEMA, the Geographical Institute, farmers' associations, agricultural co-
operatives, livestock breeders, farm workers, the Catholic Church, and the
Army. Two senators and two representatives of Parliament are also members.
Board members serve for a 2-year term. The General Manager is nominated
by the President of the Republic, and his political affiliations must be
different from those of the General Manager of CAJA.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        There are 5 separate departments at headquarters.  Field opera-
tions are decentralized as far as possible through regional offices; but
overall responsibility for direction, planning, general policy formulation,
and supervision remains at headquarters. There are about 1,500 profes-
sional and sub-professional staff, of which about 400 are at headquarters.
About one-third are administrators, one-third agricultural technicians,
one-fifth engineers, and the balance legal and other professionals. Total
staff is at present about 4,500. The agricultural development department
is composed of 4 divisions: rural development, agricultural promotion,
credit, marketing and cooperatives. Total professional staff of the agricul-
tural development department is about 80, of which one-third each are in the
agricultural promotion and credit divisions.
Finance
5.        INCORA obtains the bulk of its funds from Government but its re-
sources also include appropriations, agrarian bonds, proceeds of foreign
and domestic loans, donations and income from current operations. Adminis-
trative costs (excluding interest charged on borrowings) were about 1.5% of
the average capital employed over the three years 1966 through 1968, which
is reasonable. Summarized balance sheets and sources and applications of
funds for the period 1965-69 are given in Tables 1 and 2.
Credit Program
6.        This program started in 1964 and has been assisted by two loans
totalling US$18 million from the United States Agency for International
Development and in May, 1969, a loan of US$16.7 million from the Bank. To
be eligible for credit under the INCORA program, farmers must own or rent
10 - 150 ha of land in an INCORA development area. Details of the Caqueta
credit program are given in Annex 2.

COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION
Banking and Credit
A. The Banking System
1.        The Colombian banking system is characterized by governmental
direction of credit through a complex of official rediscount facilities
and reserve requirements. The Monetary Board, set up in 1963, controls
the system, and has become increasingly effective. Its principal control
is the percentage of deposits of each bank which have to be kept in re-
serves, either as cash or on deposit with the Central Bank. This percent-
age rose from 24% in 1964 to a peak of 34% in 1968. The Superintendency
of Banks regularly inspects all banks to insure compliance with the
controls.
2.        The Central Bank (Banco de la Republica) holds the national re-
serves, is the sole issuer of currency, and is banker for Government and
the commercial banks. It administers five special funds, of which the most
important are the Fondo Inversiones Privadas, providing foreign loans for
industry and export promotion in the private sector, and the Fondo Finan-
ciero Agraria (FFA) for short term credit in the agricultural sector.
3.        Twenty-six banks and 13 development finance companies operate
commercially throughout the country. Four of the banks (CAJA and Bancos
Cafetero, Ganadero and Popular) are semi-official, 16 are of national and
6 of foreign origin. The semi-official banks are dominant, and at the end
of 1968 held 55% of the total investment portfolio of the banking system,
which was Ps 15.2 billion. Of these, CAJA is the most important with 25%
of the total portfolio.
B. Agricultural Credit
Background
4.        A 1967 study of agricultural credit 1/ estimated the demand at
Ps 10 billion per planting season, mainly for seasonal credit for fertilizer,
pesticides, mechanized services and labor, and to be at least three times
the supply from all sources. Institutional credit reached less than 30%
of farmers, and was rarely adequate for their needs. Of this CAJA provided
about one-half, the commercial banks one-third, the balance coming from
1/   Ministry of Agriculture:  "Aspects of institutional credit in Colombia"
(in Spanish), Bogota, January 1968.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
INCORA and other institutions. Credit through CAJA reached mainly small-
holders and medium-sized farmers; credit for smallholders through the INCORA
credit program reached 2% of the total in the country. Only about 25% of
institutional credit was advanced after detailed technical appraisal of
requests, as distinct from rule of thumb evaluation by farm planners. Most
credit was given for "safe" crops, usually a fixed percentage of estimated
production costs. Delays in processing applications and in advaicing ap-
proved credits were commonplace, and many farmers who could benefit from
credit were unable to obtain it because of lack of security.
5.        The report 1/ of the IBRD 1970 Economic and Pre-investment Studies
Mission includes an Annex on agricultural credit. The report confirms many
of the findings of the 1967 study. It concludes that while lending to the
agricultural sector has been growing faster than agriculture's contribution
to the economy, the sector cannot reasonably expect to increase significantly
its share of total lending. Lack of technical know-how is the greatest
single factor limiting expansion of output so that if agricultural growth
is to be accelerated, the available credit must be coupled with improved
agricultural productivity.
Present Position
6.        At the end of 1968, the total portfolio of the banks (including
CAJA) in the agricultural sector was about Ps 5.3 billion, or 35% of their
total investment portfolio. This was slightly higher than agriculture's
contribution to GDP of about 29%. Of the agricultural portfolio CAJA held
58%, BANCO 11%, and the other banks 31%. The relationship between CAJA,
BANCO and the other banks is shown in the table on page 3 (all figures as %
of total investment portfolio). This table shows the increase in importance
of BANCO in the livestock sub-sector.
7.        Taking end 1958 as a base year (-100), total lending in real terms
at end 1968 increased to 138, of which non-agriculture 134 and agriculture
148. Of the agricultural sector, livestock increased to 125 and other pro-
duction to 169. In livestock, an average of 60% of the credit advanced
1959 through 1968 has been for breeding and growing operations, and 40%
for fattening. The percentage for breeding and growing has tended to in-
crease, and was 67% in 1968, indicating a lengthening in the average matur-
ity of the livestock portfolio, a desirable result influenced by IBRD live-
stock projects since 1966.

Fundo Financiero Agraria
B.        The FFA (para 2) is the most important source of credit for sea-
sonal crops. CAJA and the other banks are able to rediscount up to 65% of
loans made for the major crops, at rates per hectare for each crop that
are fixed by the FFA at the beginning of each season. Loans are for farms
of over 10 ha, although INCORA has special arrangements for groups of smaller
farms. In 1969 FFA discounted loans valued at Ps 1.04 billion; 44% of the
loans discounted were for cotton, in accordance with Government's policy of
encouraging its production. The discount rate is 7%, and the maximum term
usually 8 months.
Credit Terms
9.        The existing variety of terms and conditions for agricultural
loans is under study by the National Planning Department, which intends to
put forward a simplified policy. Representative loan periods are given in
the following table:

Pasture improvements                         6                      2.5
These periods are not mandatory for CAJA, which, however, usually follows
them.
10.       Security for seasonal crops is usually a lien on the crops them-
selves. Security for medium and long term loans is invariably a mortgage
on the farm and equipment, which in the case of livestock, includes both
the animals and their progeny. Additionally, all banks and CAJA insist on
a life insurance on the farmer, which is charged at a rate of 1% a year on
the loan outstanding.
11.       For non-agricultural lending, the general interest rate is 14% a
year. In agriculture, commercial bank rates permitted by the Monetary
Board start at 10% a year for loans of one year or less, increasing by
one-half percent for each additional year, up to a maximum of 14.5% for
loans of 10 years and over. However, loans supported by credit from ex-
ternal sources may carry special rates. For instance, the rate for the
IBRD Agricultural Credit Project (624-CO) is 12% a year, irrespective of
period. CAJA's agricultural rates are below those of the commercial banks,
and are: short-term 9%, medium term 11%, long term 12%. Short and
medium term loans of below Ps 5,000 are charged 1% less.
C. Agricultural Credit in Cagueta
Background
12.       In 1959 CAJA initiated a credit program for Caqueta farmers.  On
taking over responsibility for colonization throughout the country in 1962,
INCORA absorbed this program. Since then, two main programs have been
started in Caqueta, both financed partly by USAID. The first is a continua-
tion of the original CAJA program, and is for general agriculture, implemented
in association with CAJA. The second, started late in 1966, is for livestock,
in association with BANCO. Their objective is to provide short, medium and
long term development loans, coupled with appropriate technical assistance,
to farmers possessing enough land and manpower to operate a minimum viable
farm unit, but having no access to other sources of credit on commercial
terms. No farmer can stay in the programs for more than 10 years. Those
who have repaid satisfactorily their loans within this period are given



ANNEX 2
Page 5
graduation certificates by INCORA. Although at graduation they may still
be repaying program loans, they are considered capable of obtaining further
credit for working capital or investment in the commercial credit market,
where interest rates are higher.
13.       Under the first program the maximum loan is Ps 72,000, of which
Ps 27, 000 short term. Under the second, the maximum is Ps 80,000, although
farmers may have separate loans under both programs. Loans generally cover
about 60% of estimated development costs. In most cases INCORA prepares
the farm plans.  Loans are given:  (a) up to one year for subsistence,
limited to Ps 600 a family member a year for the first two years; (b) up
to 2 years for seasonal farm inputs and land rents; (c) up to 7 years for
machinery, breeding livestock and semi-permanent crops; (d) up to 10 years
for permanent crops; and (e) up to 15 years for permanent installations.
On loans above 5 years a grace period of 3 to 5 years is allowed for capital
repayment. The nominal interest rate is 8%, but since 1969 interest charges
during the grace period have been waived, reducing the real rate on loans
of over 7 years to around 5%. In every case life insurance is required,
calculated at 1% a year on the outstanding loan balance. Security is a
lien on crops for loans of up to two years, and a mortgage on the farm and
livestock for longer loans.
Performance to date
14.       Over the six year period, details of lending under these programs
are as follows:
1964   1965   1966   1967   1968   1969
New farmers (thousands)                0.17   0.67   0.42   1.44   0.64   0.47
Cumulative total farmers
(thousands)                     0.17   0.84   1.26   2.40   3.04   3.51
Value loans disbursed (Ps million)  1.5    9.8   16.0   34.2   25.1   23.7
Cumulative value (Ps million)          1.5   11.3   27.3   61.5   86.6  110.3
Average value of loans (cumulative)
(Ps thousands) 8.8   13.5   21.5   25.5   27.5   31.5
New farmers entering the programs do not receive all their loans in their
first year, and the above table shows the cumulative increase of the loans
to an average of about Ps 30,000 over the six-year period.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
15.       The two programs have been reasonably successful, but two factors
have limited their scope. The above table shows that disbursement reached
a peak of Ps 34.2 million in 1967, but declined to Ps 25.1 million in 1968
and Ps 23.7 million in 1969, with corresponding decreases in the number of
new farmers. The decline was mainly due to shortage of funds. During the
last three months of 1969, some 200 loan applications were deferred, pending
further funds; this unsatisfied demand has discouraged some potential
settlers. The second factor is that current terms for breeding cattle
loans are unsuitable, the grace period of 3 years being too short. In the
new project, the grace period would be increased to a maximum of -7 years,
which would be adequate.
16.       Under the general credit program, CAJA acts as INCORA's agent
only, providing banking and administrative services for a fee of 1% a year
on loan balances outstanding. INCORA takes the bad debts risk. At mid-
1969, 86% of loan repayment due had been made by maturity dates compared
with INCORA's country-wide average of 82%.  Of the balance about half were
rescheduled for delayed repayments. Only about 2% of its current Caqueta
portfolio are expected to be ultimately written off as bad debts. Under
the livestock credit program, the BANCO assesses the credit worthiness of
applicants, operates the program account, and accepts the credit risk. Its
fee is 4% a year of the loan balances outstanding. BANCO's bad debt write-
off is only 0.5% of its loan portfolio annually, which is satisfactory.
17.       BANCO Livestock Purchase Scheme:  Livestock is purchased from farms
offering the most favorable prices, by a comnittee comprising experts from
BANCO, INCORA and a colonists' representative. BANCO pays the seller of the
livestock, which is transported by contractors to central delivery points to
which the colonists have easy access. Cattle of similar type and quality
are sold at a uniform price. The prospective purchasers draw numbers, and
receive their cattle according to the numerical order in which the animals
leave the corral. Farmers receiving the cattle sign the loan document on
the spot.

Credit Institutions
I. BANCO GANADERO (BANCO)
Objectives
1.        BANCO was established in 1956 and reorganized in 1959.  Its
principal objective is to provide credit for the development of livestock
production. By law at least 70% of its lending must be in the livestock
sector. The rest may be for commercial and industrial purposes, preferably
to small and medium sized agricultural processing enterprises.
Organization and Management
2.        BANCO has a Board of five Directors, one representing the
President of the Republic, one the Minister of Agriculture, and the re-
mainder the private shareholders. There is no fixed term of office for
Board members.
3.        The General Manager (Mr. I.D. Bravo) has been with BANCO since
its 1959 reorganization. He is supported by the three sub-managers,
responsible for (a) Technical Affairs, (b) Credit (including Treasury and
Secretariat), and (c) Branches, Accounting, Legal and Industrial. Total
staff is about 1,400, of which about a quarter is at its Head Office in
Bogota, and the rest spread among its 57 branches in the cities. BANCO
operates one branch in Caqueta, at Florencia, and is ready to open further
branches when justified by the volume of business. Professional staff is
about 50, including agronomists, veterinarians, livestock specialists and
economists.
Florencia Branch
4.        Staff at the Florencia branch includes a manager, secretary,
credit chief, two cashiers, two accountants and the necessary subordinate
staff. Additionally, there are two veterinarians and two cattle buyers,
who operate the BANCO's cattle purchase scheme (Annex 2, para. 17).
Resources
5.        Financial details are in Tables 1 and 2.  At end-1969, BANCO's
paid-up capital was Ps 264 million, of which Government held 29%, CAJA 4%,
and private investors 67%. Capital was increased by Ps 48 million in 1968
and Ps 56 million in 1969 to bring it up to the above figure. Reserves were
Ps 33 million, about 12% of paid-up capital.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
6.        BANCO's principal resources are its demand deposits, which at
end-1969 were Ps 673 million. Central Bank discounts at the same date
were Ps 188 million, and long term loans Ps 356 million, of which Ps 218
million was from USAID and IDB. BANCO's total resources were Ps 1,671 mil-
lion.
Use of Funds
7.        At end-1969, Ps 992 million of its resources (60%) were in loans,
mostly in livestock. A breakdown of the loan portfolio over the past 5 years
is as follows:
end year 1965   1966   1967   1968.  1969

Over the past three years there has been a decrease in emphasis on loans
below Ps 5,000, together with an increase on these between Ps 5,000 and
Ps 20,000. At end-1969, 21% of the loan portfolio was for loans up to 1
year, 33% loans 1 to 5 years, and 46% over 5 years.
Financial Results
10.       Financial results are given in detail in Table 1 which also shows
the projected financial position for the next three years. These results
show that BANCO is in a sound financial position. Profit before provisions
increased from Ps 17 million in 1965 to Ps 35 million in 1969. It has
averaged over 15% a year of average paid-in capital during this period.
Salaries and administrative expenses as a % of average loan portfolio
increased in 1969 due to substantial increases in salaries and allowances,
but should drop in future. Gross income as a % of average assets has
declined since 1967, because livestock net interest rates have tended to
decrease, partly as a result of waiving interest during the grace period
of the INCORA/BANCO program. This is confirmed by the ratio of loan interest
received as % average loan portfolio. However, income after deducting
interest paid out on borrowings has shown a steadier rate in the last four
years.
11.       Loans overdue (more than three months) at the end of each year
have averaged about 5.7% as follows:
End Year                   Loan portfolio    Overdue       Overdue
- - - - Ps million - - -           %
1966                          374               23          6.1
1967                          551                36         6.5
1968                          710                37         5.2
1969                          992                49         5.0
However, most of these are repaid by the end of the following year. BANCO's
bad debts write-off each year is less than 0.5% of its loan portfolio, which
is satisfactory.
12.       BANCO's loan portfolio at end 1969 at its Florenzia branch was
Ps 38 million, or about 4% of its total loan portfolio. Of these Ps 33
million (85%) were long term. Deposits on current account at this branch
were Ps 9 million at the same date.
Audit
13.       BANCO's accounts are audited annually by the Superintendent of
Banks.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Conclusions
14.       BANCO is a well run commercial bank, doing useful work in financ-
ing livestock development. It is well managed, financially sound, and fully
capable of carrying out its project responsibilities.
II. CAJA DE CREDITO AGRARIO, INDUSTRIAL Y MINERO (CAJA)
Background
15.       In this project CAJA would be acting as INCORA's agent, provid-
ing banking and administrative services for seasonal credit. It is well
known to the Bank, since it administers the two Livestock Development
Projects (Bank Loans 448-CO and 651-CO) and supplies banking and accounting
services for the Agricultural Credit Project (Bank Loan 624-CO). It is
not, therefore, treated in this Annex in as much detail as BANCO, above.
Objectives
16.       CAJA was formed in 1931 as a semi-official joint stock company.
Its main objective is to improve agricultural production, mainly by the
small farmer, through the provision of credit and inputs. It also provides
technical assistance to its borrowers and, through its 646 branches (end-
1969), it sells agricultural machinery and a wide range of agricultural
supplies and equipment. It also provides savings and insurance facilities,
and administers some agricultural development projects.
Organization and Management
17.       CAJA is semi autonomous, and makes its own management and lending
decisions, within the framework of Government's general agricultural policy.
It is controlled by a 10-man Board of Directors comprising the Minister of
Agriculture as Chairman, and including representatives of the President
of the Republic, ICA, IDEMA, Central Bank, Coffee Growers' Federation and
Farmers' Association. The Minister of Finance, although not a member, may
also speak and vote at Board meetings.
18.       CAJA is administered by a General Manager nominated by the Board,
who is assisted by 5 sub-managers and a Secretary General heading depart-
ments covering administration, banking, finance, commerce, development,
credit and coordination. Branches have a large measure of autonomy,
and may approve loans up to certain limits for the various categories,
with Ps 120,000 being the absolute maximum. Larger branches have local
boards with authority to approve loans up to Ps 250,000. Its present
staff is about 9,000.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Resources
19.       Financial data is attached in Tables 3 and 4.  CAJA's paid-up
capital was Ps 540 million at the end of 1969, of which 82% was held by
Government, and 12% by the Coffee Growers' Federation, with the balance
(6%) held by various banks and funds. Its principal source of funds is
through its depositors, its rediscount facilities with the Central Bank,
and various foreign loans. Its reserves and provisions are high in
relation to its paid-up capital.
Use of Funds
20.       About two thirds of CAJA's funds are in its loan portfolio, and
most of the balance in investments and stocks of agricultural goods.
Financial Results
21.       CAJA aims to make its income exceed its expenditure by a small
margin each year, and to reinvest all profits. CAJA's collection record
is good, the average loss over many years being Ps 1 in 10,000. Delinquent
loans average about 12%, but most are repaid within the next year.
Audit
22.       CAJA's accounts are audited by the Superintendent of Banks.
Conclusions
23.       CAJA is fully capable of providing INCORA with administrative
and accounting facilities for short term credit for the project.

ANNEX 4
COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Land Registration and Issue of Titles
Background
1.        Since 1936, Colombian legislative acts have established the legal
principle that presumption of ownership exists in favor of those who occupy
and economically exploit the land and that, as a general rule, all privately
owned lands that remain uncultivated for ten consecutive years will revert
to public domain. These laws also make provision for the awarding of titles
to an occupier-cultivator after a number of years of exploitation. In 1961
a comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law 1/ was enacted, providing for the admin-
istration and colonization of idle public and private lands.
2.        The Agrarian Reform Law delegated to INCORA the distribution and
adjudication of public land and issue of related documents; in turn INCORA
partially delegated its powers to local government or other entities, final
authority remaining with the General Manager of INCORA.
Distribution of Government Land in the Colonization Areas
3.        After INCORA has declared a region a "Colonization Area" the
Government lands can be distributed in two ways: 2/
(a) Family Farm Units
The Family Farm Unit consists of a farm which, operated
with reasonable efficiency, can supply a family with
sufficient income to provide a reasonable standard of
living. The Family Farm Unit should normally require
only the labor of the farmer and his family, with
occasional hired labor at peak working periods (Art. 50) 3/.
At least 70% of all land to be used for private agricultural
purposes has to be in this category (Art. 45). These units
1/   Law No. 135/1961, amended by Law No. 1/1968.
2/   All references below are to the respective articles of the Agrarian
Reform Law as amended.
3/   Under existing farming systems, INCORA estimates that the minimum
land requirement of a 5-member family in the Caqueta area is 75 ha.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
are assigned to the farmer free of charge through a written
contract 1/ which obligates him to develop at least half of
the land within 5 years. The law prohibits transfer of the
land and the improvements thereon except with INCORA's
permission. After the farmer has developed half of his farm,
he is entitled to his final land title document from INCORA.
(b) Larger Commercial Units
INCORA may sell land to private persons or corporations
obligating them to develop within 5 years, 65% of the land
purchased. Sales to any one buyer may not exceed 450 ha
except in the case of special national economic interest,
where the limit may be 1,000 ha. Land may also be rented
when the national interest requires that the land remain
Government owned.
Land Distribution by INCORA
4.        INCORA has acquired about 1 million ha of land for development
and settlement since 1961 and one third of this has not yet been redistrib-
uted. From the start of its operations through the end of 1969, INCORA has
issued 100,000 land titles representing 2.7 million ha mostly to.small and
medium sized farmers. During the 1962-69 period, in the Caqueta area alone,
it awarded 5,714 titles.
5.        Land distribution to small farmers is free of charge, but INCORA
may charge for any improvements it has made on the land (Art. 45). The
recipients of large land holdings have to pay a price per hectare which
INCORA determines on the basis of the land's quality and other factors
influencing its value (Art. 33).
Issue of Titles
6.        Prior to the issue of final title documents by INCORA, the
farmer's application has to be submitted to different administrative
authorities, dependent on the size of the land holding. In Caqueta the
"Commission for the Adjudication of Public Domain" in Florencia has
jurisdication for farms of less than 50 ha; the "Corregidor of the
Intendencia of Caqueta" for these of 50-200 ha; the local land judge for
these of over 200 ha. Titles for the proposed project would be issued by
the "Corregidor of the Intendencia of Caqueta."
7.        INCORA's local offices assist farmers in the preparation of their
tttle applications and charge those who possess over 50 ha for topographicw
services (Art. 42 his). Many farmers, living at subsistence level,
1/   "Contrato de Asignacion", Art. 48.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
have no understanding of their legal rights under the Agrarian Reform Law,
and Incora has launched a campaign to educate and inform colonists of their
rights and responsibilities and of the assistance that INCORA will give in
helping them to obtain title to their land. This will reduce the activities
of unqualified and occasionally unscrupulous private practitioners in the
titling field.
8.        On receiving a request from a colonist, INCORA sends a surveyor
to make a boundary survey of the holding. Later, a senior surveyor inspects
the farms to ensure that there are no conflicting boundary claims. The legal
section in the INCORA headquarters at Florencia then completes the legal
formalities. The charge for these services is normally Ps 60-100 depending
on the size of the holding.
9.        Consideration has been given to the possibility of using aerial
photography as a means of providing suitable maps for the registration of
titles, but investigations showed that ground survey would be very much
cheaper. Aerial photogrpahy for boundary survey purposes and title pro-
cessing would not therefore be used for project operations.

ANNEX 5
COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Marketing and Prices
General
1.        Cattle, pigs and rice, the main farm products from Caqueta, are
sold through merchants on a free market. This system is not wholly satis-
factory to the less sophisticated farmers but no workable and improved
alternative is in sight and no changes are proposed under the project.
2.        About half the present production is consumed in Caqueta and
the balance in the rapidly growing cities of Bogota and Cali, and the
smaller nearby towns of Pereira, Armenia, Ibague, Neiva and Popayan.
Beef
3.        Present production of slaughter beef in Caqueta is about 40,000
head annually of which 28,000 are steers and 12,000 cows. All the cows
plus 8,000 steers are consumed in Caqueta, and the balance in Bogota, Cali
and the smaller towns mentioned above.
4.        It is estimated that Colombia's beef consumption (now 2 million
head annually) will rise at an annual rate of 5% compared with a popula-
tion growth of 3.2%. The population growth is 8% in three of the main
consumer centers (Bogota, Cali and Caqueta) and it is estimated that in
these areas consumption of beef will rise by 10% annually.
5.        Projections of marketable surpluses are set out below and those
take into account production from both existing and project farms.

ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        These projections indicate that by year 15 of the project, Caque-
ta will have to increase its share of existing markets by only 11,000 head.
With estimated consumption rising by 400,000 head in Bogota and Cali alone
during the same period there should be no problem of disposing of project
production.
7.        Except for larger farmers who can sell by the lorry load of 10
head, cattle are bought in ones and twos by middlemen and then trucked to
Florencia where they are weighed, taxes paid, and the animals shipped by
road to final destination. Adequate slaughtering facilities exist both in
Caqueta and the main consuming centers.
8.        From extensive records kept in Cali and Florencia the average
weights of beef animals at Florencia was found to be 450 kgs for steers
and 355 kgs for cows.
9.        Prices for beef in Caqueta and Cali have tended to rise over the
last 3 years but bearing in mind the estimated general increase in produc-
tion throughout Colombia a lower average price has been taken for project
calculation. In project estimates a farm gate price of Ps 4.45/kg for steers
and Ps 4.25/kg for cows has been used, a reduction of about 10% on the present
price of Ps 4.90/kg and Ps 4.70/kg respectively.
Pork
10.       National pork consumption increased at a rate of 6.2% annually
from 1965-70. Major markets for Caqueta production, however, have in-
creased consumption by 10% yearly. At present about 52,000 pigs are
produced annually in Caqueta with 32,000 consumed locally and 20,000 ex-
ported to other population centers.
11.       Although the project will temporarily increase pig production,
there will be a continuing decline from existing well established farmers.
It is usual for farmers to go out of pig production after their land has
been fully cleared (about 10 years after initial entry to the land) and
the annual incremental reduction from such farms is estimated at 2,000
head.
12.       Production and consumption forecasts for Caqueta indicate that
the exportable surplus will grow from 20,000 annually, to 31,400 head by
project year 3 and thereafter decline as shown below:

other areas                      20.0   25.8   31.4   18.4    3.6
13.       Production in some of the main areas such as Valle, which supplies
80% of the Cali market, has been rising at a rate of only 1% annually and
from the other supply sources 5% and 6%. With consumption in the main
centers rising at an estimated 10%, Caqueta will easily be able to dis-
pose of its surplus production. In fact, it is estimated that the
increased production in Caqueta would just be able to supply the in-
creased demand in Cali alone over the first three years of the project.
14.       Liveweight prices for pigs in Cali remained fairly steady over
the last 3 years at about Ps 8.10/kg, but during the latter half of 1966
prices started to rise and by January 1970 prices were as high as Ps 9.50/kg.
In the longer term, however, even though there could be some shortage of
pork supplies, it has been considered prudent to use a price of Ps 8.20/kg
in Cali, equivalent to Ps 6.65 farm gate. Based on an average weight of 75
kilos, the average farm gate value of a pig is estimated at Ps 500.
Rice
15.       The production of rice in Caqueta is heavily influenced by the
amount of jungle cleared annually during farm establishment. The project
would cause quite a sharp increase in production in its earlier years, but
because of reduced output on the more fully developed farms and because of
increased consumption in Caqueta, it is estimated that surplus production
in Caqueta would fall back to present levels by project year 6. The follow-
ing table sets out the estimated production for the first 6 years of the
project:

16.       The paddy produced by farmers is hauled to the roadside by mule
where it is bought by millers' agents or the Instituto de Mercadeo Agricola
(IDEMA) and then trucked to Florencia for milling. Millers buy about 75% of
the crop and IDEMA the balance.
17.       IDEMA not only provides storage facilities in Caqueta for about
16,500 tons of paddy (this will be increased by 4,000 tons in 1971), but it
purchases a percentage of the annual crop in Colombia at prices declared be-
fore harvest. The latter function is important in isolated areas such as
Caqueta where it would be relatively easy for local millers to form a price
ring.
18.       Paddy is harvested from June to September and although farmers
have some farm storage, most prefer to deliver their crop by December.
Paddy production forecast for Caqueta would rise to 74,500 tons in project
year 2 compared with the present 50,000 tons. The static storage capacity
of the millers and IDEMA together is 35,000 tons which is nearly sufficient
for half the maximum crop anticipated. The milling capacity of the eight
mills on a 16 hour day is over 16,000 tons monthly and thus 3 months' milling
plus existing storage can handle the forecast crop.
19.       The average price paid to the producer is Ps 1.36/kg at
Florencia but from this has to be deducted Ps 0.20/kg for transportation
from farm to collecting center and Ps 0.06 from collecting center to
Florencia. The average farm gate price is calculated to be Ps 1.10/kg
of paddy.



ANNEX 5

Timber
20.       Timber production is almost entirely in the hands of contractors
who sell to millers and wholesalers in Florencia. Over the last three years
production of the two more valuable species, cedar and armarillo, has
dropped from 10,000 tons to 7,300 tons; in the same period prices have
risen by as much as 50% which reflects the scarcity of these timbers. The
movement in supply of secondary species has also dropped but it was not
possible to check quantities as no reliable figures were available.
21.       Most of the valuable species and some of the secondary species
are exported to Cali and Bogota while the remainder of the secondary spe-
cies are used for building in the rapidly growing towns in Caqueta. Pro-
duction in the project area is estimated as follows:

22.       There should be no problem in disposing of project production as
supplies from presently exploited areas will drop to a negligible amount in
the next two years. Prices for timber have been held at 1969 levels for
the purpose of calculating the benefits of the project; valuable timbers at
Florencia are calculated on Ps 900 per ton and secondary timber at Ps 300 per
ton.

Roads
A. Present Situation
Highway Link to Project Area
1.        The Caqueta area is linked to the highway system of Colombia by
a single mountainous road from its main town of Florencia; the road is
narrow and winding and in urgent need of improvement. Feasibility studies
and designs for reconstructing this road are now in progress. The daily
volume of traffic between Florencia and Neiva is 130 vehicles with an
average of 300 tons. 1/ Transportation charges from Florencia to other
parts of Colombia are shown below:

Bogota             550                   270
Road System Within Pro_ect Area
2.        The existing road system within the Caqueta region is shown on
Map 2. The major road extends 164 km from Florencia northwest to Puerto
Rico and southeast to San Jose. The Puerto Rico-San Jose road is part of
the proposed major highway known as the Marginal de La Selva, which will
eventually stretch from Venezuela to Bolivia. The road, which has an
average width of five meters, is in need of improvement, and work is re-
quired particularly on drainage, widening and asphalt paving. Three
bridges also remain to be constructed.
3.        The present density of traffic along the Marginal route varies
from 100 to 200 vehicles per day near San Jose and Puerto Rico to 700
vehicles per day near Florencia; about half the traffic is trucks.
4.        Government has recently received a loan from the Bank for paving
of the road section Belen-Florencia-Puerto Rico, together with the con-
struction of the bridges.
1/   Public Works Census 1969.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Penetration roads leading from the major highway are surfaced
with gravel over 4 meters on an embankment of 6 meters. Construction of
most of these roads was started by thie CAJA in 1959, and work has been
continued by INCORA. The existing penetration roads are designed and
built to good alignment standards, with reasonable drainage features and
permanent bridges. The gravels occurring at the foot of the mountains give
way to clays further southeast towards the Amazon basin; these clays espe-
cially where cuts are involved, are liable to slide unless proper drainage
is maintained. INCORA engineers are aware of this problem and keep side
slopes to a minimum grade in clay soils. Maintenance is carried out by the
Fondo Nacionale de Caminos Vecinales.

River Transportation
7.        There are over 700 km of navigable rivers within the project area
and they are still important to the transportation of farm produce. The
main rivers are the Caguan, Guyas, San Pedro, Orteguaza and Caqueta. At high
water the rivers run with currents of up to 6 knots and floating debris can
be a serious hazard; at low water there are sand bars, shoals and half sub-
merged debris which make transportation difficult. River transportation times
and freight charges in the region are as follows:

INCORA's Activities in Road Construction
8.        Due mainly to shortage of funds only about 150 km of penetration
roads have been built over the past five years. Although the dry season,
which is the main road construction period, is short, with the help of
consultants and aerial photography it would be possible to speed up work
to a point where an annual program of some 50 km of penetration road and
100 km of access road would be feasible.
9.        In road construction INCORA follows the same contracting proce-
dures and technical specifications as the Public Works Ministry. Con-
tractors for construction work are selected by local or international
competitive bidding, and INCORA uses its own engineers or consultants as
supervisors. At present only one contractor in the project area is capa-
ble of building penetration roads, and only three have sufficient equip-
ment to make farm access roads. However, with a larger road construction
program more contractors would be prepared to participate.
B. Road Construction Under the Project
Priority Areas
10.       To open up forest areas for settlement and to give access to
isolated settlement areas which have developed along rivers, 140 km of
penetration roads and 240 km of farm access roads would be constructed
under the project. The construction would be on five main fronts (see
Map 2):
(i)  Albania                       - Curillo
(ii)  Valparaiso                    - La Solita
(iii)  Maguare                       - Rio Caguan
(iv)  Rio Guayos                    - Rio Caguan
(v)  Lebano                        - Penueya
Design Standards
11.       Three types of roads would be built under the project:
(a)  Penetration roads (class B):  110 km, with a gravel surface
of 4 meters on an embankment of 6 meters. The design speed
is 40 km/hr. Since the terrain is generally rolling to flat,
there would be few difficulties in finding good road alignments
on easy gradients. Construction costs, based on completed
engineering design of sectors of 3 roads are expected to
average Ps 370,000/km.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
(b)  Penetration roads (class B/C):  30 km, with a gravel surface
of 4 meters on a 5 meter embankment. The road bisecting the
Caguan-Guayas triangle, in rolling to hilly terrain and designed
for a speed of 30 km/hr, would be built to these standards at an
estimated cost of Ps 310,000/km.
(c)  Farm access roads (class C):  240 km, built on an embankment of
4 meters with a gravel surface of 3 meters to be necessary.
These minor roads are estimated to cost on average Ps 190,000/km.
12.       It is not necessary to finance construction of access trails to
each farm. These are developed by farm occupiers and follow the easiest
route to either the nearest penetration or farm access road.
13.       Ferries would be installed at Valparaiso and on the Rio Guayas,
and landing stages would be improved to accommodate river traffic (see Map 2).
Project Road Cost Estimates
14.       Cost estimates for roads to be constructed under the project area
are based on completed designs for sections of 3 penetration roads, on recent
experience in Caqueta and on the costs for similar roads financed under
an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan. Total estimated costs are
shown in the following table:
Project Road Cost Estimates
Million Ps
110 km, class B road                          40.7
30 km, class B/C road                         9.3
240 km, class C road                          40.8
3 ferries, landing stages                      5.0
Sub-total                                95.8
Engineering 5%, supervision 7%                11.2
Contingencies 10%                             11.0
Total                                  118.0
15.       The construction program would normally develop along all fronts
at the same time, emphasis on each front being dependent on the pressures
of settlement. However, the project program would be designed to construct
20% in year one, 40% in each of the two following years. Annual cost
estimates thus are as follows:

23.2      47.4        47.4
16.       It would neither be possible nor practicable for the alignments
and designs for the whole project to be prepared in advance of financing.
INCORA, however, would provide the details of each year's program three
months in advance, and loan disbursement would be contingent on these
annual proposals being agreed by the Bank.
17.       The maintenance of roads constructed under the project would be
carried out by the Pondo Nacionale de Caminos Vecinales. Penetration roads
would require Ps 4,000/km and farm access roads Ps 1,000/km annually. Main-
tenance would start one year after completion. The financial requirements
for maintenance would be:

Non-Project Roads
18.       Within the project area but independent of the project, it is ex-
pected that about 100 km of penetration road would be constructed by other
agencies during the project development period. The Ministry of Public
Works is already constructing a 15 km section of the Puerto Rico-San
Vincente road to class A standards (embankment 8 meters and a 6-meter
gravel or bituminous pavement) and the remainder of the road is likely
to be completed during the next 5 years. Recently IDB has provided fi-
nance for the completion of the Paujil-Cartagena Road over the next 3
years.
C. Economic Benefits of Project Roads
Road User Benefits
19.       Partly developed sections of the project area would benefit from
the road construction program by a reduction in the transportation cost of
existing production, and these savings have been estimated according to the



ANNEX 6
Page. 6
stage of development in each area. The savings have been.assessed by cal-
culating the difference in transportation cost of the evacuation of rice
and cattle resulting from a shift from river to road transport.  Calcula-
tions show that benefits would grow from Ps 0.78 million in the second
year of the project to Ps 2.76 million in the sixth year and thereafter.
20.       The total flow of benefits from saving in transportation costs
on existing production due to the construction of project roads is esti-
mated as follows:

Health and Education Facilities
1.        The availability of health services and schools in the remote
project area is an important factor influencing a settler's decision to
reside permanently.
Health Services
2.        The Ministry of Public Health maintains a fully staffed regional
hospital in Florencia and 4 small cottage hospitals in Belon, Doncello,
Puerto Solano and San Vicente. Under a current contract between INCORA
and the Ministry of Public Health, settlers receive free major medical
attention in these hospitals. INCORA provides Ps 240,000 annually to
the Ministry for this service.
3.        Doctors from the hospitals also attend INCORA zonal credit of-
fices each week for consultations. Settlers are given credit under the
supervised credit program to cover the costs of such consultations, and the
costs of prescribed drugs which are supplied through INCORA cooperatives.
4.        A secondary system of first aid and medical assistance in remote
areas is being developed through a rural health promotion scheme. At pre-
sent there are 20 rural health posts staffed by 104 rural health promotors,
selected from settlerst families and trained locally. They perform first
aid, give vaccinations, provide aid at childbirth, and dispense malaria
prophylactics, helminthicides and birth control materials. Serious cases
are referred to local hospitals. Some 90 additional rural health pro-
moters are now in training.
5.        The importance of such rural health services is emphasized by
cases incidence data. Roughly 12% of cases were childbirth complications,
12% avitaminosis and anaemia, 10% malaria, and 20% intestinal infections
and parasites.
6.        Based on past experiences, it will be necessary to construct a
further 6 health posts throughout new settlement areas developed under the
project if reasonable health standards are to be maintained. Each center,
including beds and equipment, would be built to a standard design and would
cost about Ps 300,000.
Schools
7.        One secondary school in Florencia is operated by the Ministry of
Education and two by religious communities. The Ministry also has ele-
mentary schools in major towns. In remote areas INCORA has constructed



ANNEX 7
Page 2
about 130 elementary schools over the past five years. Labor, construction
timber and land for such schools have been supplied free of charge by the
local inhabitants, thereby cutting construction costs by at least 50%.
INCORA provides construction supervision and certain supplies, including
roofing materials, cement, doors, windows and internal fittings.
8.        The buildings are of simple construction and to a standard
design; the school plus the teacher's house costs about Ps 100,000. A
further 90 elementary schools will be required in the project area.
9.        Schools are staffed and operated by the Ministry of Education.
The teacher's basic salary of about Ps 1,500 per month is supplemented by
giving night school instruction in reading, writing and simple arithmetic
for adult settlers.

CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Agricultural Research in Cagueta
1.        Ongoing research takes the form of field trials on rubber and
oil palm. These trials will eventually provide useful information on the
possibilities of rubber and oil palm for the Caqueta area. Insufficient
data exists on these crops to justify investment at present, although they
appear to be developing well. Some simple rice variety evaluations were
made during 1968 but no other investigations are in progress. Most sur-
prising, no work is being carried out on pasture grasses and legumes.
Rice
2.        About nine different rice varieties are grown by farmers, but
none are ideally suited to the high rainfall and low fertility conditions
of Caqueta. Major varieties are Blue Bonnet, Rexora, Century, Mono Olaya,
Tapuripa, Guacari and Triano. Farmers are advised to buy dressed Blue
Bonnet seed but the quantities sown are still small, although under the
present credit program farmers have been producing 200 sacks of improved
seed annually.
3.        The production of so many varieties with different milling and
processing characteristics makes the drying, storage and milling of the
rapidly expanding Caqueta rice crop difficult. If only two or three suita-
ble varieties were grown, and selected seed was readily available to
farmers, rice would be a more profitable crop. Particularly needed is a
rice variety that will yield reasonably well without fertilizer to fit
in with the present simple system of agriculture.
Oil Palm
4.        INCORA has established about 200 ha of oil palm with French bila-
teral technical assistance. An additional 400 ha were planted on settlers'
farms, but most of these plantings are in very poor condition with only
126 ha likely to come into production.
5.        About 80 ha of oil palms are in production, and in the past their
fruit was used for feeding pigs or for the home extraction of cooking oil.
A small Colombian made extraction plant is now being operated by INCORA for
trial purposes, and this will provide further information on the future
possibilities of oil palm in the area.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
Rubber
6.        Rubber trials are being made with clonal material from the Los
Brilliantes rubber station in Guatemala, where breeding and selection has
been underway with U.S. assistance since 1944. Natural rubber seed from
the Caqueta area is used for rootstocks.
7.        Field plantings, both on INCORA land and on settlers' properties,
started in 1966, and to date 420 ha have been established at La Mono and
Maguare. These should start bearing in 1970.
8.        The rubber planted by INCORA has developed well and looks healthy.
Terrain and soils appear suitable provided fertilizers are used, but cli-
matic conditions are ideal for development of the South American leaf
disease (Dothidella spp) and highly resistant planting material is neces-
sary. High yielding resistant clones, bred in Guatemala, have been plant-
ed; also, susceptible Malayan material topworked with resistant material is
being tried.
9.        INCORA intends to expand the rubber plantings, and has established
extensive nurseries already. So far about 30% of 1967 plantings on settlers'
farms have been abandoned or destroyed in favor of shorter term crops and
most settlers are reluctant to expand their rubber without an effective
demonstration of the profitability of the crop. Continued research and
demonstration is required to improve rubber production techniques and to
determine the economics of the crop. Reliable results will not be availa-
ble for another three or four years.
Pastures and Livestock
lO.       There is a wealth of native legumes in the other established pas-
tures and current stocking rates of about one head/ha could be probably be
doubled by introducing better legumes and by grazing pastures in rotation.
In view of the long term importance of pastures and livestock in providing
the basis for stable colonization, work is urgently needed on pasture
management (especially the sub-division of paddocks), legume establishment
and fertilization.
11.       Under the project, research would be initiated immediately into
pasture production and utilization with emphasis on the use of tropical
legumes for increasing productivity. Rice investigations would also be
initiated to ascertain the varieties best suited to the low fertility and
management levels associated with settler production.
12.       The research would be undertaken by the Instituto Colombiano
Agropecuaro (ICA) under contract with INCORA: ICA would provide qualified
professiornal staff and management and INCORA, land, inputs and operating
expenses. This system is working successfully in other INCORA project
areas,.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
13.       Most of the work would be undertaken at La Mono, the existing
rubber and oil palm station, but trials would also be conducted on settlers'
farms in the project area. The project would include fellowship training
for ICA staff and two visits of a tropical legume and pasture specialist
to monitor the pasture program.

COLOMBIA
CAQIETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Taxation and Government Tax Revenues
1.        In the project area taxes are levied on land, cattle, pigs, con-
sumer goods, timber concessions and personal income, and accrue to either
the National Government, the Intendencia of Caqueta, or to the Municipali-
ties. It is estimated that these taxes would amount to about Ps 9.5 mil-
lion by project year 15 and thereafter.

Total                   1.2       6.3      8.6
Taxes Paid to Municipalities
2.        Land Tax:  Settlers pay a land tax of 0.4% of the assessed land
value as determined by the cadastral office of the Instituto Geografico.
Land values range from Ps 100/ha in inaccessible areas to Ps 1,000/ha in
areas better served by roads. For project calculations, a mean land value
of Ps 600/ha has been used and it is estimated that project farms would be
liable for a total land tax of Ps 1.7 million by project year 11 and there-
after.
3.        Pigs Slaughter Tax and General Abattoir Fees:  The municipalities
charge for the use of abattoir facilities and additionally impose a
slaughter tax on pigs. A charge of Ps 6/head is also levied for weighing
cattle sold and transported out of Florencia to other markets in Colombia.
It has been assumed that sufficient cattle and pigs would be available
from existing farms to meet all local needs and that there would be no
increase in revenues from pig slaughter taxes attributable to this project.
However, fees for weighing the increased number of steers sold out of the
area would amount to Ps 0.2 million from project year 10 onwards.

Taxes Paid to the Intendencia at Cagueta
4.        Consumer Goods Taxes:  Taxes on liquor and cigarettes presently
amount to Ps 7.4 million annually (or about Ps 50/head of population). As
the project would increase the population of Caqueta by 2,800 immigrant
families (or 20,000 people) in 3 years and would increase net income and
money circulation in Caqueta, it is estimated that tax revenues on con-
sumer goods would rise by Ps 1.0 million by the 3rd year.
5.        Cattle Slaughter Tax:  A slaughter tax of Ps 8/cow and Ps 6/steer
on all cattle killed in Caqueta abattoirs is levied by the Intendencia.
This currently brings in about Ps 115,000 annually but has been ignored in
project calculations as it has been assumed that in the future cattle
slaughtered locally would be supplied from non-project farms.
Taxes Paid to the National Government
6.        Cattle Slaughter Tax:  One of the most important taxes which
would be paid by cattle dealers and butchers is the national slaughter
tax of Ps 50/cow and Ps 100/steer. The production attributable to the
project would increase this tax revenue by Ps 2.4 million in the,10th
year, rising to Ps 3.0 million by the 15th year.
7.        Income Tax:  Income tax would be payable by settlers once their
new income rose above an estimated Ps 18,000 level of personal allowances
(man, wife and 4 children). Government revenue from this source is esti-
mated to amount to about Ps 1 million by the 12th year.
8.        Capital Assets Taxes:  A capital assets tax calculated on in-
creased herd values (effective on male cattle over 2 years old) is also
levied, but the estimated revenues are so low that they have been ignored
in project calculations. However, a cattle tax on livestock inventory
is payable on all male stock over one year old at a rate which currently
averages Ps 20/herd, (lri practice, it is based on the value of 4 kg
meat/head). These taxes would rise to Ps 2.5 million by project year 10.
9.        Timber Concessions and Taxes:  Timber taxes and concession fees
are payable by merchants in the project area and amount to about Ps 16/
cubic meter of timber sawn and extracted. Tax is calculated as 10% of
the on-site value (about Ps 120/cubic meter) of timber passing through
check points and timber concessionaires are charged Ps 4/cubic meter of
sawn timber extracted. Timber tax revenues and fees would be paid only
on the volumes of cedar and amarillo passing out of Florencia for other
areas of Colombia, and not on material used locally. Revenue from these
sources would amount to Ps 0.3 iillion by project year 4 and continue for
some 6 years, gradually disappearing thereafter as the forest is cleared.

National. Intendeacia and Municlpal Governments as a result of carrying out

ANNEX 13
COLOMBIA
CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT
Rate of Return Calculations
1.        Table 1 shows that the estimated economic rate of return from
investment in the project would be about 16.5%. If family labor was valued
at Ps 4,000 per annum the rate would be reduced to about 8%.
2.        The following assumptions and inputs have been used in the
calculations:
(a) Project Life
The life of the project has been taken as 20 years. This is con-
servative since farms developed under the project would have appreciably
longer lives.
(b) Costs
Details of project costs are at Annex 9. A contingency of 10% is
included in administration, investment and operating costs. Farm budgets
are at Annex 2; no cost has been attributed to the farmers' own labor and
no value added for the 2 ha of subsistence crops grown in the holding. In
the case of partially established farmers who receive credit under the
project only incremental costs are used in the calculation of the economic
benefits.
(c) Benefits
(i) Yields
These are based on reliable data available in the project area
(see Annex 2) and are as follows:
(1)  Paddy          - 1,000 kgs/ha
(2)  Pigs           - 73 kgs liveweight at 12 months old
(3)  Steer beef    - 450 kgs liveweight at 4 years old
(4)  Cow beef       - 355 kgs liveweight at slaughter



ANNEX 13
Page 2
(ii) Prices
Prices used for livestock are about 10% lower than present and
the paddy price the same as 1969 (see Annex 5 for details). Farm gate
prices have been used for the purpose of calculating the economic return,
and are as follows:
Pesos per Kilogram
(1)  Paddy                 1.10
(2)  Pigs                  6.50 liveweight
(3)  Steer beef            4.45 liveweight
(4)  Cow beef              4.25 liveweight
(iii) Farmer Benefits
In the case of partially established farmers who receive credit
under the project only incremental production is used in the calculation of
economic benefits.
(d) Sensitivity Analysis
The effect of increases or decreases in farm gate values is as
follows:
Farm Gate Values               Rate of Return
+ 20%                           21%
+ 10%                           19Z
+
0%                           16.5%
- 10%                           14%
- 20%                           11%
