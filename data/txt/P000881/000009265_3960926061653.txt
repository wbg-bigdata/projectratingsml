MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO GHANA
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL SERVICES REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Ghana
for SDR 13.3 million (US$17 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance an
agricultural services rehabilitation project.
2.        Background. Agriculture in Ghana contributes about 53 percent of
GDP, absorbs nearly 60 per cent of the total labor force and supplies up to
77 per cent of total merchandise exports. It is primarily rainfed, small-
holder agriculture. The productivity of smallholder cultivation is low in
both food and industrial crops. The agronomic potential to significantly
raise productivity exists for most crops. To raise productivity, however,
requires supportive incentive and institutional frameworks. The Economic
Recovery Program (ERP), launched in April 1983, is providing the supportive
incentive framework particularly through its substantial devaluations and
significant increases in the prices of industrial crops. The institutional
framework for agriculture, largely provided by the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) and the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board (COCOBOD), is weak. MOA is
responsible for formulating and implementing policies and programs and for
delivering fertilizer and a range of services: tractor hire, extension,
veterinary and irrigation.  The MOA is also responsible for supervising the
operations of eighteen agricultural state owned enterprises (SOEs) which
are engaged mainly in production and marketing. Apart from COCOBOD, the
other institutions serving agriculture are area based development projects
and research institutes. Except for those receiving donor support, all
these public sector agricultural institutions suffer, in varying degrees,
from severe resource constraints. As a result, MOA has not been able to
fulfill its policy role and its departments have not been able to provide
effective and timely delivery of services and inputs to agriculture.
Within the context of the ERP, the Government is committed among other
things to a far-reaching program of institutional reform: to improve the
pay scales and staff structure for the civil service and the management of
state owned enterprises. For agriculture, what is now required is a
concrete program for strengthening key functions of the major agricultural
institutions.
3.        Project Obiectives.  The basic objective of the proposed project
is to initiate a self-sustaining process of rehabilitation so that the MOA
can give more effective support to agriculture. Specifically, it has two
interrelated objectives: to strengthen the institutional framework for the
formulation and implementation of agricultural policies and programs; and
to improve the delivery of public sector services to agriculture.
4.        Project Description.  The project includes:  (a) the
reorganization and strengthening of MOA's work in policy formulation,
planning, monitoring and evaluation; (b) the preparation of a national



- 2 -
master plan for research and funding of research on cotton and rice
(irrigated and valley bottom); (c) the reorganization of MOA'e agricultural
extension services in 3 regions on a pilot basis, as a forerunner to a
national extension project, related training and logistical support to the
maize-cowpea program assisted by the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA); (d) the strengthening of the Ghana Irrigation Development
Authority through a twinning arrangement, the introduction of improved
agronomic practices on existing schemes and investment in six small scale
pilot irrigation schemes; (e) logistical support for veterinary services;
and (f) studies of the agricultural credit system and of food security.
The project includes a program for improving sector management with respect
to the privatization of MOA's fertilizer handling operations and of its
tractor hire services, divestiture of selected agricultural State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs), regular review of the investment program and improved
cost recovery from veterinary and irrigation services.
5.        The project thus seeks to strengthen public sector capacity in
areas where the Government has a long-term role to play and to put an end
to public intervention in other areas. The project, to be carried out over
five years, provides for technical assistance, staff training, logistical
support, importation of agricultural inputs and incremental operating
funds. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$53.3 million. The
foreign exchange component is US$49.1 million or 92 percent. Financing
includes contributions from UPDP of US$1.5 million and the Government of
Ghana of US$1.3 million and parallel financing for agricultural inputs from
the African Development Bank of US$25 million and from KFW (Germany) of
US$8.5 million. The AfDB financing will support the elimination of
fertilizer subsidies and the privatization of fertilizer supply under the
proposed project as well as meet demand for fertilizers and chemicals. The
KFW financing of veterinary vaccines and drugs will be complemented by
IDA-financed logistical support to MOA. It will support increased cost
recovery on these items and through a revolving fund to be established
under the project, ensure future supplies. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Ghana are given in schedules C and D respectively. A
map is also attached. The staff appraisal report, No. 6645-GH dated April
22, 1987, is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The proposed project is an
integral part of the Bank's portfolio of current operations in support of
the Government's ERP. It extends the institutional reforms initiated at
the macro-economic level down to the sectoral level. It translates the
institutional objectives of the ERP, which is now being supported by a
Structural Adjustment Program, into a concrete program of reform for key
public sector agricultural institutions. Institutionally, the SAP
contains: (1) a timetable for staff redeployment throughout the civil
service; (2) a skill mobilization scheme to attract and retain competent
senior staff to implement the ERP; (3) a phased reform for SOEs with
initial focus on priority SOEs whose corporate plans must be reviewed and
approved by the Government and on initial divestitures; and (4) annual
reviews of a rolling three-year public expenditure program to develop an
expenditure structure supportive of the priorities of the ERP. The



- 3 -
proposed project would enable the MOA to support item (3) and to
participate in all the other major reform measures. Five agricultural SOEs
are expected to be included in the first-phase SOE divestiture program
agreed under the SAP, and divested with assistance under a recently-
appraised Public Enterprise Project directly supporting that program;
reform of the remaining thirteen would be assisted under the proposed project.
In addition, the project would enable the MOA to respond to the Govern-
ment's Action Program for agriculture which was also conceived as a
component of the ERP. The program includes, among other things, the
privatization of fertilizer delivery and of tractor hire services and the
strengthening of a range of public sector services to improve technology
uptake in predominantly traditional agriculture.
7.        Actions Agreed Upon.  In addition to the usual covenants, the
following are key assurances obtained at negotiations: (i) dhe Government
would set interim and long term staffing levels for the PPMED by December
31, 1987; (ii) the Government would submit to IDA at least three months
prior to each fiscal year, the annual budgets and work programs of all MOA
implementing units relevant to the project; (iii) the MOA would implement a
phased program to reduce fertilizer subsidies and to privatize fertilizer
handling, so that the subsidy is eliminated for the crop year 1990 by
December 31, 1989, and the MOA's role in the import and distribution of
fertilizer is terminated in 1991; (iv) the MOA would discontinue its
wheeled tractor hire services by the end of 1987, combine harvester
services by February 28, 1989 and land clearing services by June 30, 1991;
and (v) the MOA would complete and have reviewed by IDA and other donors an
agricultural research study and master plan by June 30, 1988.  Conditions
of Effectiveness would include: (i) the Government's signing and agreement
with UNDP to provide technical assistance and other support for PPMED; and
(ii) the MOA's making satisfactory arrangements for implementing the
agricultural state-owned enterprises reform program, including
establishment of a unit to coordinate SOE program activities and
appointment of key staff to the unit. As a condition of disbursement for
the irrigation component, the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority would
enter into a twinning agreement with a suitable irrigation authority on a
basis satisfactory to IDA.
8.        Justification.  The longer-term benefit is stronger public sector
support for agricultural development in three key areas: (1) formulating
policies to promote an efficient market- and export-oriented development in
agriculture; (2) developing an investment program which can sustain the
ERP; and (3) revitalizing the delivery of public services with potential to
promote the structural transformation of agriculture. The imediate
benefits are in training and developing a core of managerial and technical
staff in the MOA and in shedding economic activities that can be undertaken
more efficiently by the private sector.
9.        Risks. There are institutional risks of two kinds. The first
risk is of delays in the public sector reform program undertaken at the
macro level under the SAP. Since the project is in good part a sectoral
extension of macro levt. initiatives, delays in the overall program could
adversely affect progress at the sectoral level. The second is -hat PPMED
will not be able to retain the competent higher level staff whom the
project has trained and who will be required to carry through the program.



- 4 -
These risks are mitigated by the consensus that has been achieved within
the Government, between senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning and the MOA and between the Government and IDA.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
