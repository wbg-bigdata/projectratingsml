                    Standard IDA Grant terms
                    SDR 1.2 million (US$1.8 million equivalent)
Operation Type      The proposed operation is the second in a series of two
                    programmatic development policy operations. In addition to IDA
                    financing, AusAID is expected to provide budget support of
                    US$5.3 million for the same set of policy actions.
Main Policy Areas   The proposed operation will support actions in the following
                    policy areas: (i) strengthening public financial management; (ii)
                    strengthening fiscal policy; and (iii) promoting structural reforms
                    relating to the business enabling environment.
Key Outcome         The key outcome indicators for the program over the medium term
Indicators          are: (i) budget credibility at the level of ministries; (ii) public
                    access to key fiscal information; (iii) an effectively managed civil
                    service wage bill; (iv) curtailment of growth in the cost of tax
                    exemptions; (v) improvements in the financial reporting of SOEs;
                    (vi) reduction in the cost of doing business; and (vii) energy prices
                    that better reflect the costs of supply.
Program             The proposed operation will assist the Government of Tonga
Development         (GoT) to implement key aspects of its medium-term reform
Objective(s) and    agenda, while providing a predictable flow of resources in a
Contribution to     challenging fiscal environment. Over the last four years, Tonga’s
CAS                 economy has been hit hard by a series of crises, which have
                    caused a slowing of economic growth, a significant fiscal gap to
                    emerge, and poverty to increase sharply. At the same time, Tonga
                    has made the transition to a more democratic political system. The
                    proposed operation provides the Bank with an opportunity to
                    support key public sector and economic reforms at a critical
                    juncture in Tonga’s development process.
                    The proposed operation contributes mainly to the first theme of the
                    CAS, of supporting policy reform to strengthen economic growth

                                            i
                 prospects and improve service delivery. The policy actions
                 supported by the proposed operation will strengthen critical
                 aspects of public financial management as well as key components
                 of fiscal policy that underpin the delivery of services, including
                 revenue effort. The policy actions also support essential structural
                 reforms, including in the business regulatory environment. In
                 addition, the policy actions and associated budget support will
                 facilitate accumulation of cash reserves, contributing to the third
                 theme of the CAS on building resilience against shocks.
Risks and Risk   The main risks of the proposed operation and their associated
Mitigation       mitigation strategies are:
                  Severe capacity constraints in particular areas of Government
                     and associated reliance on donor technical assistance may
                     mean that the operation cannot be implemented as successfully
                     or as quickly as expected, especially in the context of the
                     current Government restructure. This risk is being mitigated
                     through: i) selection of a limited number of key reform actions
                     to prevent overspreading of scarce capacity; ii) strong dialogue
                     with Government to ensure ownership of supported reforms;
                     iii) the provision of technical assistance to support the
                     Government restructure as well as other policy actions.
                  Macroeconomic disruption arising under several feasible shock
                     scenarios, including natural disasters, could distract available
                     capacity and resources from implementation of actions
                     supported by the program, as well as undermine the impact of
                     these actions on growth and poverty-reduction. This risk is
                     being mitigated through the government’s accumulation of
                     cash reserves and strong policy dialogue around the
                     management of macroeconomic shocks and challenges,
                     including with the IMF.
                  Political uncertainty persists in the current challenging
                     economic environment, and given the recent reform of
                     political institutions. This risk is somewhat mitigated through
                     extensive dialogue building strong ownership of proposed
                     reforms across a broad range of policy-makers and officials.

              SECOND TONGA ECONOMIC RECOVERY OPERATION
                                GRANT
                       TO THE KINGDOM OF TONGA


                                  I.     INTRODUCTION

1.     The proposed operation is the second in a programmatic series of two
development policy operations. The operation will be financed by IDA resources of US$1.8
million and AusAID is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0
million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank’s operation
being approved. The operation will help the Government of Tonga manage severe economic
challenges that have coincided with historic political reforms. It supports a focussed program
of Government reform priorities in public financial management, fiscal policy, and business
environment reforms while providing a vital fiscal buffer in the context of sustained revenue
contraction. The series of operations coincide with the term in office of Tonga’s first
Government to be selected by a majority-elected parliament and provide an opportunity for
the Bank to support Tonga at a critical juncture in its development process.

2.      Tonga faces many of the challenges typical of small island economies. Almost
unique in the extent to which it is disadvantaged by smallness and isolation, Tonga has a very
narrow production base and is vulnerable to economic shocks. The population of just 104,000
is spread over 36 islands which are extremely isolated from global centres of production and
population. Lack of economies of scale and long distance to larger markets push up costs of
production and erode opportunities for successful exporting. High levels of imports are
financed by aid and remittances – with remittances averaging 32 percent of GDP over the past
decade. Dependence on imports means the economy is exposed to changes in the international
prices of fuel and other commodities. Capacity constraints associated with a small public
sector necessarily limit the achievable scope and pace of reform efforts.

3.      Tonga’s economy was in a vulnerable state prior to the Global Economic Crisis
(GEC) and has witnessed a weak recovery. Despite achieving major progress over recent
years against a broad program of public sector and structural reforms, Tonga was poorly
placed to weather the GEC. Factors contributing to vulnerability included ongoing declines in
remittances, falling agriculture exports, food and fuel price increases, rising levels of public
debt, and a contraction in private sector credit following a domestic credit bubble. As
remittances and tourism receipts declined further during the crisis, Tonga relied on grants and
concessional loans to offset falling revenue and to finance fiscal stimulus through major
capital projects. The economy is now showing some signs of recovery, with improvements in
revenue performance, bottoming out of remittances, and a recent uptick in tourism receipts.
                                               1
Recovery has been hampered, however, by a series of natural disasters and ongoing budget
support assistance will be required to maintain service delivery standards and bolster broader
recovery.

4.      The programmatic series of Economic Recovery Operations focuses on three
reform areas. Areas of focus reflect Government’s concern to support short-term recovery
and mitigate continuing impacts of the crisis on the poorest households while maintaining
progress against longer-term structural reforms to deal with ongoing fiscal and economic
challenges. Areas of focus include: i) strengthening public financial management; ii)
strengthening fiscal policy; and iii) promoting structural reforms relating to the business
regulatory environment. The first Tonga Economic Recovery Operation also supported
reforms to strengthen social protection.

5.      Significant progress was achieved under the First Economic Recovery Operation.
To strengthen public financial management, the first operation supported the establishment of
a system for in-year monitoring of budget execution and the reform of the budget calendar to
make budget proposals available to the public when tabled in the legislative assembly. To
strengthen the management of the wage bill, the first operation supported efforts to bring
recruitment in all areas of the public service under centralized control. In promoting structural
reform, the first operation supported policy decisions to reduce electricity costs for poor
households and improve incentives for renewable energy generation through reform of the
electricity tariff. In this area, the operation also supported the introduction of new petroleum
pricing template to reduce the cost of petroleum products and increase the effectiveness of the
regulatory framework, and the publication of audited accounts for economically significant
public enterprises. To improve social protection, the operation supported the adoption of a
community public works scheme to generate cash-earning opportunities for the poorest
communities.

6.      Progress has been made against specified triggers for a second operation.
Reflecting the fluid economic context and the extent of capacity constraints across
Government, progress against the individual triggers specified under the previous operation
has been expectedly uneven. While some specific triggers for a second operation have not
been met – often due to factors beyond Government control – others have been exceeded.
More generally, Government continues to make progress against priority reforms within all of
the areas of focus specified under the previous operation. The Bank has reviewed, with the
authorities and development partners, the progress in the implementation of the reform
program and, considering the areas of faster than expected progress as well as those with
slower than expected progress, has found overall progress to be robust. The Bank expects that
the reforms and policy implementation through the actions supported by both the first and the
second operation will cumulatively help Tonga achieve the development objectives of its
reform program supported by this series of operations.

                                               2
7.      The Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation will build on the gains
achieved to date. In the area of public financial management, priorities reflect the importance
of embedding transparency and solid Public Financial Management (PFM) foundations
following recent political reforms. Actions in this area include introduction of a Treasury
Single Account, publication of in-year budget reports, and the tabling in Parliament of audited
Annual Financial Statements of Government. Under fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on
strengthening revenue effort to maintain delivery of public services following substantial
revenue declines. Actions in this area include policy decisions to introduce small business and
natural resource tax regimes and measures to increase transparency of the costs of tax
exemptions. In relation to structural reform, the focus is on easing constraints to viable
sources of private sector development, particularly in the tourism sector through introducing
an improved business license regime.

8.     Supported reforms will deliver improvements in living standards within
inevitable and ongoing resource constraints. Current policy priorities are focussed on
achievable improvements in the business environment while ensuring a sound
macroeconomic environment and strengthening systems for improved accountability and
service delivery. Such measures are intended to increase resilience to future shocks and
improve living standards, even in the context of limited growth over the medium-term.
Supported measures are not, on their own, expected to lead to any step-change in growth
performance given the extent to which Tonga’s economy remains constrained by smallness,
distance to large markets, and exposure to a difficult international environment. Sustainability
of Government finances is likely to remain reliant on budget support from development
partners over the medium-term, given difficult economic conditions and weak revenue
performance.

9.      The proposed operation is the product of strong dialogue between the
Government of Tonga, the Bank, and development partners. The Bank has worked with
Government and development partners in coordinating the formulation of a joint policy
reform matrix that outlines shared reform priorities. A subset of reforms included in the joint
policy reform matrix are supported by the proposed operation, with AusAID also expected to
provide budget support of AUD 5 million for the achievement of the same set of policy
actions. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Facility (PFTAC), the European Union (EU), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
have also been closely involved in policy discussions around the identification of reforms to
be supported by budget support. PFTAC, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and ADB
are providing technical assistance to the Government of Tonga in implementing included
actions relating to business environment and revenue strengthening measures. ADB, AusAID,
the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Development Group (NZ-IDG),
and the EU may also provide budget support against the policy actions associated with any
future World Bank operation developed through the joint-donor dialogue during FY2013/14.
The multi-donor dialogue around budget support has played a key role in mobilizing political
                                               3
attention, administrative effort, and technical assistance to implement reforms. The strong
consensus achieved around policy actions reflects the extent to which Government and
development partners are firmly committed to a harmonized approach to budget support and
the medium-term goals of the Tonga Strategic Development Framework.

10.     The proposed operation carries high risk due to capacity constraints within the
public sector, exposure to external economic shocks and natural disasters, and the
possibility of further change within Government. The proposed operation faces three main
risks. Firstly, Tonga experiences the thin capacity typical of public sectors in very small
states, with a small number of qualified public servants called upon to implement the many
tasks of a central government. Severe capacity constraints in particular areas may mean that
the operation cannot be implemented as successfully or as quickly as expected, especially in
the context of the current Government restructure. Secondly, macroeconomic stability is
dependent on successful fiscal consolidation, recovery of remittances, and continuing grant
support from donors. Macroeconomic disruption arising under several feasible shock
scenarios, including any substantial scaling back of external assistance, would distract
available capacity and resources from implementation of actions supported by the program, as
well as undermine the impact of these actions on growth and poverty-reduction. Finally,
Tonga’s political system has been recently reformed and political conditions could be subject
to rapid change. While Government has remained stable over the length of the current term,
political dynamics within the new system are poorly understood. Broader political changes
remain a possibility in the current challenging economic environment, and represent a source
of substantial uncertainty, given limited experience under new political institutions.

                                  II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN TONGA
11.    Tonga is a small, remote economy that is highly vulnerable to external economic
shocks and natural disasters. Tonga’s population of 104,000 is dispersed across 36 of the
176 islands that make up the archipelago. Located in the South Pacific, Tonga is one of the
most remote countries in the world, when measured by indicators of proximity to major
markets.1 Small size and remoteness combine to push up the cost of economic activity in
Tonga, limiting competitiveness of its exports of goods and services in world markets. These
same factors also push up the cost of providing public services. In addition, the openness of
Tonga’s economy and the lack of diversification of its sources of foreign exchange make
Tonga highly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while its geographical characteristics
make it highly vulnerable to natural disasters.

12.    Supported by remittances, aid flows, and strong Government commitment to
service delivery, social indicators remain among the strongest in the Pacific. The gross

Studies: Working Paper No. 3, Pasifika Interactions Project.

secondary enrolment rate is currently estimated at 106 percent, with no significant decline
since the global economic crisis. Under-five mortality, at 16 per 1000, continues to decline.
The child immunization rate for measles is 99 percent, while 98 percent of births are attended
by skilled health staff. Life expectancy continues to improve, and recently reached 72 years.
100 percent of the population continues to have access to an improved water source.

13.     Indicators paint a mixed picture regarding the position of women in society. The
female enrolment rate is higher than the male enrolment rate for secondary and tertiary
education. The female labour force participation rate, at around 50 percent, is higher than
other Pacific countries at comparable levels of income (Samoa and Fiji). 30 percent of civil
servants are women, but women remain underrepresented at senior levels of the bureaucracy.
The maternal mortality ratio, which has been stable for the last 20 years, is 36.5 per 100,000
live births. The contraceptive use is at about 27% (2008) and the total fertility rate is 3.8
(2006). Recent political reforms opened the door for women’s representation in parliament,
but only one Member of Parliament is female. There is no legislation prohibiting domestic
violence or sexual discrimination. Women are unable to own land and, because of
incompatibility of its provisions with traditional land ownership models, Tonga has not
ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women (CEDAW).2

14.      Like other small, remote economies, Tonga depends on a very limited number of
sources for its foreign exchange earnings and has a relatively undiversified economic
base. Remittances are Tonga’s largest source of foreign exchange, averaging just under -32
percent of GDP over the last decade. Tourism receipts are Tonga’s next largest source of
foreign exchange, averaging about 6 percent of GDP over the last decade. Merchandise export
receipts have averaged about 5 percent of GDP over the last decade and have declined
substantially during this period. Tonga also receives significant development assistance, with
cash grants averaging 3 percent of GDP over the last decade but 5.1 percent of GDP over the
last five years. Tonga also receives significant in-kind grants, which amounted to some 3–6
percent of GDP in each of the last two years. The services sector dominates the economy,
among which government services – at about 15.5 percent of GDP – are the largest
component, closely followed by commerce, restaurants and hotels – at about 14.5 percent of
GDP. Commercial services are dominated by wholesale and retail trading activities, which
largely distribute imported goods (imports are equivalent to about 40 percent of GDP). Due to
its reliance on a small productive base, and heavy exposure to external conditions, Tonga’s
economic growth trajectory reflects the impact of various shocks rather than the dynamics of
a business cycle.

15.     Recent economic performance has been weak despite structural reforms. Since
2007, Tonga has progressed major tax policy and customs administration reforms, while
strengthening the business regulatory environment and corporatizing and privatizing several

SOEs. Reflecting these reforms, Tonga’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
rating has increased from 2.9 to 3.5 over the last five years. The growth benefits of these
reform efforts have been somewhat undermined, however, by geographical disadvantages and
a range of shocks. GDP growth has averaged about 1.5 percent per annum over the past
decade. While low compared to both other Pacific Island Countries and the broader East Asia
Pacific region, recent analysis suggests that a large portion of Tonga’s slower growth
performance can be explained by these inherent geographical disadvantages of smallness and
isolation. Recent economic growth has also been adversely impacted by several shocks,
including the impact of blight on agricultural export performance, a prolonged civil service
strike in response to sweeping civil service reform proposals, and major civil disturbances
sparked by protests demanding political reform, which caused widespread damage to the
capital, Nuku’alofa.

16.    The Tongan economy entered the global economic crisis in a vulnerable state.
Remittance flows to Tonga peaked as a proportion of GDP in 2004/05, following which they
declined substantially in the years prior to the GEC– possibly reflecting the aging of emigrant
stocks and weakening relationship links. With heavy reliance on imported food products and
energy, the global food and fuel crisis led to inflation of 12 percent in 2008.3 Price hikes
disproportionately impacted on poor, urban households – highly reliant on cash incomes in
the absence of subsistence opportunities – and the current account deficit widened to 14.7
percent of GDP by 2009. Growth momentum was further weakened by a contraction of
domestic credit following a poorly-judged lending surge on behalf of commercial banks in
late 2007 and 2008. Non-performing loans peaked at 20 percent in mid-2009, with a 25
percent contraction in credit to the private sector between 2008/09 and FY2010/11, as banks
became increasingly risk-averse. The Government contracted a large loan for reconstruction
of Nuku’alofa in 2007 from the China EXIM bank, reducing capacity for sustainable
additional borrowing.

17.     The global economic crisis had a severe impact on remittances and exports. With
economic slowdown in key remittance sending countries – the US (where over 50 percent of
Tonga’s remittances originate), New Zealand and Australia – the decline in remittances
accelerated. From 31.1 percent of GDP in FY2007/08, remittance receipts fell by 13.6 percent
and 10.1 percent over the next two years, to reach 22.5 percent of GDP in FY2009/10. At the
same time, with New Zealand, Australia, and the United States also being Tonga’s largest
tourist markets, Tonga’s tourist receipts declined by 13.3 percent in FY2009/10. Led by falls
in agricultural and fish exports, merchandise exports also continued their declining trend in
FY2008/09 and FY2009/10.

 Two-thirds of food consumed in Tonga is imported. All grid-supplied electricity (which accounts for 98 percent
of total electricity consumption) is generated using imported diesel.

18.    The crisis had a major impact on Government revenues. In FY2008/09 and
FY2009/10, tax revenue fell 6.4 and 11.3 percent in nominal terms. Falling remittances fed
through into declining imports, and consequent reductions in consumption tax, import duty
and excise revenue. While revenue policy settings remain appropriate and in line with
regional comparators, the revenue impacts of remittance declines have generated pressure to
consolidate expenditure and identify alternative financing sources.4

19.     Economic and poverty impacts of the crisis were ameliorated by donor-financed
fiscal stimulus and major capital projects. Despite sharply contracting revenues, the
Government of Tonga was able to substantially increase expenditure through donor support.
An extraordinary grant from China supported a seven-fold increase in capital expenditure in
2008/09 for road investments, which supported an increase of total Government expenditure
and net lending of 28.8 percent. In FY2009/10, an inflow of project aid and capital
expenditure and on-lending associated with loans from China’s EXIM Bank more than
compensated for the scaling back of Government capital expenditure, while ADB budget
support of 9.5 million pa’anga allowed recurrent expenditure to be maintained. Despite the
magnitude of the economic shocks facing Tonga up to and during the economic crisis, fiscal

  The pace of revenue declines was exacerbated by the simultaneous implementation of the second phase of an
ambitious tax reform program designed to shift the burden of taxation away from trade taxes by reducing import
tariffs, raising excises and introducing a consumption tax. The tax reforms were revenue-neutral, overall, but
were divided into two sets. The first set was implemented partway through FY2004/05 and had an overall
positive impact on revenue receipts. The second set, implemented during FY2007/08, had an offsetting negative
impact on revenue receipts which unfortunately coincided with the initial impacts of the crisis. A 2011 PFTAC
review concluded that Tonga’s revenue settings remain appropriate and f ound limited scope for increases in tax
rates without negative poverty and growth impacts. See the ‘Analytical Underpinnings’ section for a detailed
discussion of this review.

stimulus and major capital projects prevented a major economic contraction, with growth of
zero percent in 2008/09, and 1.9 percent during FY2009/10.

20.    Tonga’s recovery from the GEC remains partial, fragile, and reliant on donor
support. In FY2010/11 and FY2011/12, remittances continued to decline as a proportion of
GDP, to reach their lowest level since FY2001/02. Tourism receipts have shown a recent
uptick, but merchandise exports have remained sluggish, reflecting continued lacklustre
performance of the agricultural sector. Despite these constraints, the economy of Tonga has
continued to expand since the GEC, with growth of 1.4 percent in FY2010/11, and 1.6 percent
in FY2011/12. This growth has been largely driven by grant and debt-financed stimulus as
development partners and the Government responded to the immediate need for supporting
aggregate demand. Total spending grew by 7.7 percent in FY2010/11, as capital investment
and on-lending from China EXIM Bank loans offset small declines in recurrent expenditure.
Budget support of 22.8 million pa’anga (13.2 percent of the government-funded budget)
played a key role in maintaining recurrent expenditure. Total expenditure declined slightly in
FY2011/12, as the pace of development project implementation slowed and recurrent
expenditure was restrained to support the accumulation of cash reserves. As grant- and debt-
financed expenditure falls from the historically high levels seen over recent years, maintaining
growth, sustaining public service delivery, and avoiding further increases in poverty represent
major challenges in the context of still-uncertain international conditions.

21.      Monetary conditions have remained accommodative over the past two years, but
private credit growth remains constrained. Increases in international reserves and limited
sterilization led to large accumulation of banks’ excess reserves. But private sector credit
growth has remained negative due to the weak economic outlook and the application of
tighter lending standards by now-risk-averse banks, constraining private sector development

and job creation. The banking system is adequately capitalized but non-performing loans
remain high.

22.     Natural disasters continue to impede Tonga’s recovery from the global economic
crisis. In September 2009, Tonga was buffeted by a tsunami, causing loss of life and
significant material damage, particularly in the outlying Niuas island group. In February 2010,
a cyclone affected the whole of the archipelago, with the worst impact in the Vava’u island
group, causing widespread material damage. In February 2011, a cyclone hit the Ha’apai
island group, causing significant damage to infrastructure and housing. In February 2012,
                                                 9
cyclone Jasmine caused widespread flooding in Nuku’alofa and associated damage to
property and businesses. Aside from the private costs of the natural disasters, these events
cause a periodic diversion of public resources away from implementing the development
program of the Government and towards immediate reconstruction needs.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
23.     Macroeconomic conditions are expected to improve over the short-term. Inflation
fell to 4.6 percent in FY2011/12, down from 6.1 percent in FY2010/11, and is expected to
remain at around 4.5 percent during FY2012/13. This reflects a stabilization of import prices
and exchange rate appreciation. Inflation of around six percent is expected over the medium-
term, consistent with historical averages, as private sector credit returns to positive growth in
response to the accommodative monetary policy adopted by the National Reserve Bank of
Tonga (NRBT), and fuel prices strengthen. The current account is expected to widen to 6.1
percent of GDP during FY2011/12, reflecting imports for major capital projects, but then
narrow to less than two percent of GDP in the medium-term as tourism receipts strengthen
and remittance-financed imports of consumption goods – while recovering – remain below
pre-crisis levels. Despite the widening current account, donor inflows have allowed the
continued build-up of foreign reserves – now equivalent to 5.9 months of import cover – but
pressure is expected to build on the foreign exchange position as donor flows slow over the
medium-term. According to the IMF, the currency remains broadly in line with fundamentals.
With inflation forecast to decline over the short-term, the exchange rate is expected to remain
broadly stable against the currency basket.

24.      Growth is expected to remain at modest levels through 2012/13 and dependent on
grant support. As fiscal stimulus is gradually removed, the pace of growth is expected to
further slow from 1.6 percent in 2011/12 to 1.2 percent in 2012/13, with the balance of risks
tilted to the downside. Consumption growth is expected to pick-up as remittances increase
slightly, driven by recovery in the United States and New Zealand, but remain well below pre-
crisis levels. The recent uptick in tourism is expected to continue, similarly driven by
improved global economic conditions. The growth outlook remains heavily contingent on
ongoing grant support from donors, with grants expected to reach record highs of 12.4 percent
of GDP in 2012/13. Modest growth over the medium term is projected to occur in the context
of ongoing population growth and slowing emigration. GDP per capita is not expected to
return to 2005 levels until around 2019.

25.     The Government remains reliant on budget support to overcome current fiscal
challenges. The overall fiscal deficit declined to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011/12, and a small
surplus of around 0.6 percent of GDP is expected in FY2012/13 as fiscal consolidation
continues. This outcome depends on ongoing budget support grants, continued efforts to
improve tax and customs performance, and careful expenditure management. The tax policy
framework is considered generally sound, but planned tightening of exemptions and
deductions has the potential to yield increases in revenue of around 0.5 percent of GDP per
year over the next two years. On the expenditure side, the Government’s medium-term fiscal
framework shows substantial reductions in recurrent spending of 3.5 percent of GDP by
FY2016/17, supported by improved control in payroll expenditure. Allocations in the
FY2012/13 budget (excluding China EXIM Bank financed expenditure and donor projects)
represent a real decline in recurrent expenditure. With government revenues continuing to fall
short of expenditure, budget support will play a key role in maintaining acceptable standards
of service delivery.5

  In FY2011/12, Tonga received nearly 40 million pa'anga in budget support grants (15.1 million from the Bank,
12.8 million from the EC, 8.9 million from AusAID). This was equivalent to 23.3 percent of government-funded
expenditure, and reduced the overall budget deficit from 6.6 percent of GDP to 1.7 percent of GDP.

26.      Tonga faces challenges in achieving more robust economic growth over the
medium-term. Due to inherently higher cost structures associated with geographical isolation
and smallness, growth opportunities are concentrated in areas where economic rents can be
generated– as from natural resources such as tourism and fisheries. Tonga’s tourism sector
has considerable untapped potential, which continued business environment reform and
targeted donor assistance may help to unlock. Tonga’s agricultural exports could receive a
boost from new heat treatment and fumigation facilities, helping Tonga overcome non-tariff
barriers in nearby large markets. Improving the efficiency of the public enterprises that
provide infrastructure services could also benefit households and businesses, as could further
efforts to reprioritise government expenditure towards higher priority areas such as agriculture
and infrastructure ministries. Development of fisheries resources represents an additional area
of opportunity, which Tonga is seeking to pursue with World Bank technical assistance.
Further expanding access to international labour markets represents one of the most promising
sources of supporting living standards over the longer-term, through remittances, tourism
(from returning migrant families), and skills and knowledge transfers.6 While credit growth is
forecast, continued risk aversion on behalf of commercial banks is likely to continue to
somewhat constrain access to credit.



6
 The Ministry of Tourism estimates that returning Tongan families constitute 70 percent of current visitor
arrivals.
                                                                         12
27.     Prospects for achieving a step-change in growth performance are limited. While
much could be done to facilitate growth from the sources listed above, their potential to affect
major changes in economy-wide output should not be overstated. It is not clear that any set of
policy measures could be relied on to deliver sustained and substantial improvements in
economic growth due to inherent disadvantages faced by Tonga arising from its small size
and geographical isolation. While making the most of potential growth opportunities is vital,
policy priorities for Government also reflect the seriousness of geographical constraints to
growth. Current policy priorities are focussed on achievable improvements in the business
environment, ensuring macroeconomic stability and strengthening systems for improved
accountability and service delivery. Such measures are intended to increase resilience to
future shocks and improve living standards without any major step-up on the current growth
trajectory.

28.     Tonga’s remains at high risk of debt distress. The latest joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for Tonga reports the present value of external debt at 33
percent of GDP in FY2011/12, as against a policy-dependent threshold of 30 percent. The
large majority of debt relates to the two large China EXIM Bank loans contracted for
reconstruction of Nuku’alofa in 2007 and road infrastructure in 2010. Under the baseline
scenario, the present value of debt remains above the policy threshold until 2014/15, before
declining to 15 percent of GDP by 2016/17. Tonga’s debt and debt servicing also breach the
relevant debt-to-export and debt service-to-export ratios for prolonged periods. When
remittances are taken into account, breaches are shorter and less severe but still occur. The
baseline scenario presented in the DSA assumes continuation of the recent tourism uptick,
remittance recovery, recurrent expenditure restraint including wage control, maintenance of
grant support at current nominal levels, and successful implementation of revenue reforms.
Stress tests indicate Tonga’s vulnerability if progress against these objectives is not achieved.
Key medium-term vulnerabilities include lower GDP growth, external shocks impacting on
tourism or exchange rate, or incomplete implementation of revenue and expenditure reforms,
all of which would see larger and more sustained breaches of policy thresholds.7 The DSA
concludes that, taking into account the cushion provided by remittances, Tonga’s projected
debt profile is consistent with manageable – if high risk – debt dynamics.8

29.     The Government is committed to returning its debt to sustainable levels and
managing the challenges associated with increased debt servicing obligations. The
Government has maintained a policy of avoiding any new debt, even on concessional terms,
over the past year, in order to regain the fiscal space needed to respond to future shocks. It has
also introduced and implemented a policy of using domestic borrowing only for the purposes
of in-year cash management. As grace periods on loans expire over coming years, the debt
servicing profile will present a major challenge to fiscal sustainability, with substantial

7
  Medium-term vulnerabilities indicated in by the DSA include lower GDP growth, currency mismatches, credit
risks on government’s balance sheet, and new borrowing on less concessional terms.
8
  Despite the rise in total debt, the Government has continued to reduce its domestic debt level – to an estimated
5.4 percent of GDP as at April 2012, relative to about 20 percent of GDP at the beginning of the last decade.
                                                        13
reprioritization of resources and successful management of wage bill pressures necessary to
avoid either a failure to meet debt obligations or potentially significant declines in the
provision of public services. The Government is committed to implementing such
reprioritization measures and has been working closely with the World Bank to identify
expenditure options consistent with maintenance of service delivery and reallocation of public
investment towards priority sectors.

30.      The current macroeconomic policy stance is satisfactory and sustainable over the
medium-term, but outcomes remain subject to uncertainty and reliant on ongoing
international assistance. A sharper than expected rise in global commodity prices would
exacerbate inflation and threaten the incipient economic recovery in Tonga. The global fallout
of possible developments in the European debt crisis and in the US economy could yield a
further shock for Tonga’s remittance flows, which poses a threat both to growth and fiscal
stability. The macroeconomic policy framework also depends on the continued availability of
grants from development partners over the medium term, given Tonga’s high risk of debt
distress and hence the inadvisability of borrowing to fund fiscal deficits. The FY2012/13
budget has been developed with projected budget support receipts of TOP$22 million. If the
committed level of donor support does not materialize or if there are significant delays in its
provision, fiscal stability would be threatened. Budget support assistance is likely to remain
necessary to avoid a damaging contraction in Government recurrent expenditure and an
associated deterioration in service delivery. The upcoming remuneration review presents a
potential additional risk with any large increases in the civil service wage bill likely to cause a
widening of the deficit or substantial disruptions to service delivery through cash shortages
and the squeezing out of non-payroll expenditure. Finally, Tonga remains vulnerable to a
variety of natural disasters, including tsunamis, cyclones, and flooding.

 III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

31.     Tonga’s national development strategy is set out in the Tonga Strategic
Development Framework, 2011–2014 (TSDF), which was endorsed by the current
government in May 2011. The extensive consultation process underpinning the TSDF began
under the previous government. Individual line ministries worked interactively with their
stakeholders, including both civil society groups and private sector entities, over a period of at
least one year, in preparing their strategies for contribution to the TSDF process. The Ministry
of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) then led the coordination process within
government, whereby line ministries worked together to integrate their sector-specific
strategies into a single national development strategy. The TSDF was approved by Cabinet at
a special meeting convened for the purpose in May 2011.

32.   The vision guiding the TSDF is to develop and promote a just, equitable and
progressive society in which the people of Tonga enjoy good health, peace, harmony and
prosperity, in meeting their aspirations in life. To achieve the vision of the TSDF, the
Government aims to deliver on nine strategic objectives.
                                                14
33.    The first objective is to build strong, inclusive communities by engaging local-
level groups in meeting their service needs and ensuring the equitable distribution of
development benefits across and within communities. Protection and support is to be
provided to vulnerable communities and vulnerable groups within communities – including
women, the elderly and youth – especially unemployed youth. Rural and outer-island
communities are to be supported through community-specific development programs that are
implemented in conjunction with the communities themselves.

34.     The second and third objectives concern the role of a dynamic public and private
sector partnership in driving economic growth, and the importance of adequate
infrastructure for business activity and household wellbeing. Under the second objective,
the Government will work to ensure that public sector policies and services create an enabling
environment in which the private sector can flourish, including through the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability. Emphasis is placed on the key industries of tourism, agriculture,
fisheries and temporary labour abroad. Under the third objective, the Government is
committed to implementing its National Infrastructure Investment Plan, which is a medium-
term plan for energy, telecommunications, water, solid waste management and transport
infrastructure. This plan provides a valuable framework for prioritizing between infrastructure
investment projects and is expected to improve coordination on project selection between
Government and development partners.

35.     The fourth, fifth and sixth objectives focus on key aspects of human development.
Under the fourth objective, the Government aims to strengthen educational standards,
particularly by improving the quality of the universal basic education it provides. Under the
fifth objective, the Government aims to improve the technical and vocational education and
training available to Tongans, to enable them to take advantage of employment opportunities
both in the domestic labour market and in labour markets abroad. Under the sixth objective,
the Government is committed to the provision of quality, effective and sustainable health
services, with a particular focus on health promotion and on tackling the growing incidence of
non-communicable diseases.

36.     The seventh, eighth and ninth objectives concern governance. Under the seventh
objectives, the Government aims to integrate cross-cutting concerns relating to Tonga’s
distinctive culture, fragile environment and vulnerability to natural disasters and the impacts
of climate change, into all government programs. Under the eighth objective, the Government
is committed to adhering to the principles of good governance, accountability, transparency
and the rule of law, in order to improve the governance of Tonga at this critical juncture in its
political history. Under the ninth objective, the Government aims to strengthen the operation
of the judiciary and to maintain law and order to ensure a safe, secure and stable society.

37.    The delivery of these objectives is to be facilitated by four ‘enabling themes’ on
the public sector, macroeconomic framework, public enterprises and development
assistance. The efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector is to be improved, by
                                               15
focusing on core functions, optimising the use of resources, improving service delivery and
improving coordination. On the macroeconomic framework, the TSDF emphasises the
importance of good fiscal management, including effective revenue collection and sound
public expenditure management. On public enterprises, further reforms are planned to
improve their accountability and sustainability and to accelerate the privatisation agenda. On
development assistance, the TSDF stresses the value of a coordinated approach to Tonga’s
relationship with development partners. Each enabling theme in the TSDF is underpinned by
a set of specific strategies, which are themselves allocated to particular ministries to
implement.

38.     The proposed operation will support the objectives and enabling themes of the
TSDF. The public financial management reforms in the proposed operation will support the
objective of good governance, particularly with respect to accountability and transparency, as
well as the enabling theme on good fiscal management. The fiscal policy reforms will bolster
the enabling themes on good fiscal management and the efficiency and effectiveness of
government. The structural reforms will support the private sector and infrastructure
objectives, as well as the enabling theme on public enterprises.

39.     The operation has been developed through a process of detailed consultation with
all relevant authorities and stakeholders, both within the central government and at the
sector-specific level. The proposed operation was developed through dialogue mechanisms
established to support the previous economic recovery operation. The Government has
established a Budget Support Management Committee to facilitate discussion and monitoring
of progress around actions under the Government reform program to be supported by the
operation. The MFNP provides secretarial support to the committee and it includes
representatives from various agencies involved in all key areas of the reform program,
including the Ministry of Public Enterprises, the Ministry of Labour, Commerce and Industry,
Revenue Services, and, recently, Tonga Power Limited and the Tonga Energy Roadmap
Implementation Unit. The operation design reflects dialogue with the Civil Society Forum of
Tonga, an umbrella NGO, regarding the social and poverty impacts of recent economic
shocks.

40.     Relevance of the actions supported by the proposed operation was reaffirmed
during a major economic dialogue in March 2012. Hosted by the NRBT and attended by a
broad range of Government, NGO, private sector, and donor representatives including the
Bank, this dialogue highlighted broad consensus around many of the reforms being supported
through the proposed program. Key messages arising from the dialogue included 1) the need
for careful management of debt and improved expenditure allocation in the context of
upcoming increases in debt-servicing obligations, 2) the need to focus economic reform in
areas of potential advantage, especially in tourism, and 3) the importance of business-enabling
environment reforms, including improvements in regulatory processes and economic
infrastructure to support private sector development.

           IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

41.     The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for the Kingdom of Tonga,
FY2011–2014 (CAS) is built around three themes of reform, integration and resilience.
The first theme is supporting policy reform to strengthen economic growth prospects and to
improve service delivery. The second theme is generating opportunities through greater global
and regional integration. The third theme is building resilience against shocks. The proposed
multi-year programmatic series of operations contributes mainly to the first theme of
engaging with the Government on policy reforms to strengthen growth and improve service
delivery. It supports policy actions aimed at strengthening critical aspects of public financial
management as well as key components of fiscal policy that underpin the delivery of services,
including revenue effort, expenditure quality and control of the civil service wage bill. The
actions also support essential structural reforms, including in the vital energy sector, in public
enterprise reform and in private sector development.

42.     The CAS provides scope for a multi-year programmatic series of operations to
respond to the aftermath of recent economic shocks and to underpin an agreed program
of reforms. The CAS envisages that the provision of budget support will depend on the new
government’s commitment to continue work to strengthen public financial management,
improve revenue collection and expenditure prioritisation, and pursue structural reform. These
goals are reflected in the TSDF and the policy actions supported by the proposed operation.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

43.     The World Bank and the IMF have worked closely in Tonga and reached shared
perspectives on key macroeconomic and structural reform issues. The Bank has
participated in the last four Article IV missions, facilitating the discussions on fiscal policy
and structural reform in particular. The Bank and the Fund jointly prepare the DSA each year
for Tonga. Based on this cooperation, the Bank and the Fund share a common view about
Tonga’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities.

44.    The Bank has led efforts to coordinate development partners in the provision of
budget support to Tonga. The World Bank represents all donors providing budget support
on the Budget Support Management Committee, which is the primary mechanism for formal
dialogue regarding selection of and monitoring progress against policy actions. AusAID
budget support of AUD 5 million is expected to be mobilized for the same policy actions. A
single point of contact between donors and Government reduces strains of coordination on
Government, and World Bank co-ordination of this process reflects the strength of the
dialogue between the Bank and the Government on economic policy as well as within the
energy sector. ADB, AusAID, EC, PFTAC and NZ-IDG are all providing assistance to the


                                               17
achievement of the proposed program of policy reforms through varying combinations of
budget support and technical assistance.

45.     The Bank cooperates closely with key development partners in the provision of
analytical work and technical assistance to Tonga. ADB and PFTAC staff informally peer-
reviewed the Bank’s macro-fiscal analysis in late 2010. PFTAC staff participated in Bank
informal review processes for the Bank’s technical assistance on the medium-term
expenditure mapping. This work has been informed by, and is tightly integrated with, the
ADB’s technical assistance on a medium-term budget framework and PFTAC’s technical
assistance on a tax policy and administration review. Bank and ADB staff participated in the
PFTAC-led tax review.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

46.     The proposed program provides a key mechanism for strengthening policy
engagement as analytical and financial support is scaled up. Total IDA and Trust Fund
commitments to Tonga over the past three years amount to almost US$73 million, compared
to $30 million between 1985 – when Tonga became a member – and FY10. All assistance has
been provided on 100 percent grant terms. Bank leadership of the joint donor budget support
process has played an important role in facilitating this expansion through strengthened policy
dialogue around major infrastructure investments, including: i) a broadband cable, co-
financed with ADB (US$17.2 million); ii) transport sector reform, with Pacific Regional
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) and AusAID financing (US$14.7 million); and iii) aviation
sector support (US$27.2 million).

47.     The proposed operation builds on the previous economic recovery operation and
the Bank’s Energy Sector Development Policy Operation, undertaken in late 2010. The
proposed operation represents a direct continuation of support to policy reforms identified
during the first economic recovery operation, including through continued focus on public
financial management reforms, fiscal policy, and structural reform. The proposed program
also builds on the earlier energy-sector budget support operation, which helped the critical
energy sector reform program to remain front and centre of the policy agenda in Tonga during
the transition to a new government. The proposed operation will help to take the previous
operation forward, by supporting the Government as it undertakes the next key policy actions
needed to implement the TERM.

LESSONS LEARNED

48.    The proposed operation reflects key lessons learned from the four development
policy operations that the Bank has undertaken in the Pacific Islands. The proposed
operation draws lessons from the First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation, Samoa
Economic Crisis Recovery Support Credit in mid-2010, and the Tonga Energy Sector
Development Policy Operation in late 2010.
                                              18
49.     Development policy operations can be mobilised relatively quickly and achieve
good results in the context of strong government ownership of a reform agenda. In both
the Tongan and Samoan operations, budget support needed to be mobilised relatively quickly,
with the Bank’s ability to respond facilitated by strong government ownership of a reform
agenda and an existing base of analytical work. In the case of Samoa, the reform agenda was
broad, and substantive and realistic policy actions that could be supported within short
timeframes were readily identifiable. In the case of Tonga, the government had a deep
commitment to a sector-specific reform agenda, which formed a ready foundation for the
operation. In both cases, the Bank’s engagement provided momentum at a time when the
reform agendas could have gone off-track due to the multiple challenges then facing the
governments. For the proposed operation, the Government has a strong commitment to a
broad reform agenda. Bank engagement has assisted the Government to clarify and sequence
its reform program, and will provide momentum to implement the reforms in a challenging
fiscal context.

50.     Project-level engagement can assist in identifying key priorities to be supported
through policy-based operations. Both the Tongan and Samoan operations demonstrated
how prior project engagement can provide a vital foundation for identifying key policy
reforms that can drive further progress in important sectors, assisting the implementation of
the reforms, and tracking progress closely with relatively little additional monitoring effort.
The leveraging of project and technical assistance engagements for policy-based operations is
being repeated in the proposed operation in respect of the energy sector and public enterprise
actions.

51.     Close coordination and engagement with other development partners in the
identification of policy priorities is useful in sectors where the Bank has limited
knowledge and engagement. The Tongan and Samoan operations reflected the general
context of Bank engagement in the Pacific Islands, with the Bank having insufficient presence
to maintain in-depth knowledge of all sectors across all countries. In key sectors where the
Bank did not have active project or policy engagement, task teams drew selectively on
analytical work and advice from other development partners to quickly build knowledge and
make judgments regarding policy priorities across a broad range of sectors. In the proposed
operation, the task team worked very closely with other development partners to help identify
possible reform areas and to gather background information and experience to judge potential
actions, particularly from the ADB and IFC in the area of public enterprise reform and
PFTAC in relation to revenue reforms.

52.     Coordinated management of international aid flows, in the context of prudent
fiscal policy, can provide vital support in mitigating the impacts of external shocks in the
Pacific Islands. Without the aid flows provided to Tonga and Samoa to help them respond to
the shocks they were facing, the impacts of these shocks would have been more extensive and
prolonged. Development assistance played a vital role in financing essential government
services, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. These operations demonstrated the
                                              19
importance of coordination between macroeconomic policy and international aid flows in
managing economic shocks, a lesson that is equally applicable to the proposed operation in
Tonga, given the continuing effects of the shocks Tonga has experienced in recent years.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

Growth Prospects and Priorities

53.     Recent analytical work highlights the importance of geographical constraints to
growth in the Pacific. Under the “Pacific Futures? label, the Bank has worked with other
development partners in analysing, discussing, and communicating the constraints of
geography faced by small Pacific Island Countries, including during a seminar to discuss
these issues, held in Suva, Fiji in November of 2011. All small countries face constraints to
private sector development and the delivery of public services due to the absence of scale.
Small markets undermine economies of scale in production, preventing specialization, while
the fixed costs of Government must be met by smaller populations with narrower tax bases.
Capacity constraints are also more severe than in larger countries, with a limited pool of
individuals in various specialized fields required to fulfil all of the tasks of Government.
Other, less remote, small countries have been able to somewhat mitigate the costs of
smallness through trade integration, specializing in production of a small range of exports to
finance high import reliance. Options for adopting such strategies are limited in Pacific Island
Countries due to very severe geographical isolation, with high transport costs undermining the
competitiveness of exports and pushing up the costs of imported inputs. Analysis has shown
that such disadvantages are sufficiently severe to explain lower rates of growth in the region
over recent decades. Reflecting inherent geographical constraints, small Pacific Island
Countries have typically relied on labour mobility, natural resource industries (that can attract
investment despite higher cost structures), and aid flows to support standards of living.

Public Financial Management Reform

54.     Performance indicators of public financial management in Tonga have shown an
improvement in recent years. In the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) assessment, Tonga received 16 ratings of “C? or better out of the 27 applicable
indicators. In the 2010 PEFA assessment, the number indicators that Tonga scored “C? or
better increased to 20, with further improvements observed against some indicators where
performance was already strong. Reflecting tax policy and administration reforms, marked
improvements were noted on the transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities, and the
effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and tax assessment. Improvements were
also noted for orderliness and participation in the annual budget process, the effectiveness of
controls on payroll and non-salary expenditure, and the timeliness of accounts reconciliation.

55.    The 2010 PEFA highlighted several weaknesses in PFM, which will be tackled
over the course of the proposed multi-year programmatic series of operations. The

                                               20
coverage of in-year budget reports was identified as an area for improvement, because the
existing reports could not be used to compare actual and forecast revenues and expenditures,
weakening control of budget execution. Public access to key fiscal information was found to
be limited, in part because the budget proposal is made public only when it is approved, not
when initially submitted to the legislature, and in-year budget reports are not made public.
The process for legislative scrutiny of the budget was also found to be inadequate. Budget
credibility was found to be weak at a disaggregated level, with significant variances in the
composition of the outturn resulting from the shifting of resources between ministries during
the year through the ‘Contingency Fund’. Significant weaknesses were found in the external
audit process, in the scope, nature and follow-up of the external audit, and in legislative
scrutiny of audit reports. Weaknesses were also identified in the chart of accounts, arrears
collection, and timeliness of submissions of the annual financial statements.

56.     A PFM assessment by PFTAC in 2010 provides further clarity on weaknesses
and guidance on the appropriate sequencing of PFM reforms. In the assessment, PFTAC
lays out the PFM building blocks that need strengthening in Tonga as a foundation for the
planned introduction of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF). These include
consolidating bank accounts, automating bank reconciliations and moving towards a Treasury
Single Account (TSA), as well as improving the clarity and uniformity of application of the
chart of accounts. Improved revenue, expenditure and cash flow forecasting is recommended,
along with better monitoring of budget execution and more frequent consultations on
execution with ministries. PFTAC also identifies the pressing need to strengthen planning
processes in line ministries and the links between plans and the budget, and to control the use
of the Contingency Fund.

57.    The findings and recommendations of these reviews are closely reflected in the
reform measures being supported by this program. Further improvements to quarterly
budget reporting and the tabling of Government Financial Statements are expected to improve
transparency and contribute, over time, to increased credibility. The establishment of a Single
Treasury Account is also being supported through the proposed program. The first Economic
Recovery Operation supported changes to the budget process in order to allow public release
of the budget proposal, which occurred for the first time during the FY2012/13 budget
process.

Fiscal Policy Reform

58.    The Bank’s macro-fiscal analysis provided a foundation of knowledge for
appropriate revenue and expenditure reforms in Tonga. The World Bank’s macro-fiscal
analysis, completed in 2011, showed how recent declines in tax revenue were driven by the
adverse impact of the global economic crisis on remittances and the end of the domestic credit
bubble on corporate taxes, as well as the coincidental timing of the completion of Tonga’s tax
reforms. This analysis provided a solid basis for the revenue policy and administration review
carried out by PFTAC in 2011. The analysis also showed how expenditure restraint has
                                              21
impacted on service delivery, with controls on discretionary expenditure in the context of
wage bill expansion undermining expenditure quality and threatening higher future costs.
These conclusions provided a basis for the detailed expenditure mapping work in FY2011/12.

59.      A review of revenue policy and administration was carried out by PFTAC in
2011, and broadly confirmed the appropriateness of current tax policy settings. The
review identified drivers of the sharp declines in revenue during 2008/09 and FY2009/10 as:
(i) falling trade tax revenues due to planned reductions in trade tax rates and increased
exemptions and non-compliance; (ii) falling income tax revenues due to reduced tax rates in
the context of falling incomes and the global economic crisis; (iii) a substantial decline in
consumption tax revenues, due to a decline in consumption of items with a large domestic
value added component due to lower remittances and declines in the post-duty value of
imported goods due to the reduction in trade taxes; (iv) various problems with exemptions and
compliance. The review concluded that Tonga’s current tax rates and structure are similar to
many other countries and that overall tax performance is in the mid-range. The review
recommended reforms to exemption and concession processes to improve transparency and
reduce revenue loss, while also rationalizing, and making less severe, the existing penalty and
interest regime for late payments and non-compliance. Over the medium-term, the review
recommended the introduction of a presumptive tax for SMEs to reduce the administrative
burden on the Revenue Service and new tax regimes for natural resources and land rentals. In
the longer-term, the review recommended applying income tax to pensions to remove existing
distortions and strengthen revenue. Reforms supported by this operation relating to the
publication of tax expenditure information, the introduction of a presumptive tax, and the
introduction of a natural resource revenue regime are all informed by this review.

60.     The World Bank’s expenditure mapping work has highlighted the need for
careful expenditure reprioritization. This work was undertaken collaboratively with the
MFNP during FY2011/2012, and assessed the scope for meeting expenditure needs in priority
sectors in the context of continued fiscal constraint and upcoming debt-servicing pressures.
The analysis shows that it is possible for Tonga to increase spending in priority areas over the
medium term, but that this will require not only higher levels of tax collections and/or budget
support but also wage restraint, such that the wage bill declines somewhat in real terms over
the medium term - particularly in non-priority sectors. The analysis also highlighted problems
with budget execution and identified the need for improved expenditure control, including
through: i) placing more limits on discretion of line ministries to transfer resources in-year,
which has typically occurred at the cost of priority areas and critical inputs; and ii) improving
the definition and scope of programs and sub-programs to better reflect ministry activities and
allow greater linkages between policy, planning, and budgeting.

61.     PFTAC provided assistance to Tonga in strengthening its debt-management
framework in late 2011. With debt servicing obligations due to expand rapidly over coming
years, a PFTAC team worked with the Tongan authorities to identify and address system
weaknesses and capacity gaps in debt management. The review recommended several steps
                                           22
for strengthening the debt management framework, including: (i) establishing a clear policy
for contracting all new debt, including evaluations against the objectives of the debt
management strategy and ensuring consistency with the risk management objectives; (ii)
developing a formal debt management strategy that identifies and quantifies the existing risks
in the portfolio and determines a portfolio composition and borrowing strategy that is
consistent with fiscal and monetary policies and realises the government’s costs and risk
objectives; (iii) forming an effective high-level policy committee to provide policy direction,
oversight, and cross-government coordination to debt management operations; (iv) improving
debt reporting practices, including producing a regular public report with complete debt
information; and (v) strengthening key technical capacities of staff working in the debt
management unit of the MFNP. The World Bank is currently planning to provide technical
assistance to implement certain elements of recommended reforms.

Structural Reform

62.     The Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) lays out a strategy to reduce Tonga’s
vulnerability to oil price shocks and achieve an increase in quality access to modern
energy services in a financially and environmentally sustainable manner. The related
analytical work traces the implications of oil price volatility for electricity prices, and the
implications of rising oil prices and energy demand for the viability of renewable energy
sources for the grid. The analysis demonstrates the need for a comprehensive reform of the
legislative, regulatory and institutional framework applying to the energy sector – including
updating the regulatory framework for the electricity supplier to ensure its incentives are
aligned to those of consumers in least cost energy sources.

63.    Two studies by the Bank on the petroleum sector identify existing weaknesses in
the regulatory structure and supply chain for petroleum, and lay out a series of reforms
to remedy these weaknesses.9 The studies show that around 90 percent of Tonga’s energy
needs come from imported petroleum products. Fluctuations in underlying fuel prices impose
the biggest cost, with transport and storage costs imposing additional, but more limited, costs.
The overarching recommendation is to prioritise reforms to strengthen the petroleum
regulatory regime, improve the competitive environment and increase energy security.
Several phases of reforms are recommended, in order to ensure that Tonga is better protected
from volatility in world oil prices and that fuel costs in Tonga reflect efficient costs of supply,
storage and distribution. In addition, reforms to the regulatory regimes for petroleum are
recommended, to enable the benefits of these reforms to be passed on to consumers

64.    The IFC has recently undertaken a comprehensive review of constraints to
tourism development in Tonga. During April 2010, IFC Advisory Services (Pacific) worked
with the Tongan Ministry of Tourism to identify constraints to tourism development through

9
 The first study, The Regulation of Tonga’s Petroleum Sector, was completed by the Bank in June 2010. The
second study, Tonga Oil & Gas Supply Chain Efficiency & Price Stabilisation , was completed by the Portland
Group for the Bank, also in June 2010.
                                                     23
the application of IFC’s Tourism Sector Diagnostic (TSD) Tool. The primary objective of the
diagnostic study was to identify and measure sector constraints, in order to propose and
mobilise appropriate solutions. Key constraints to sustainable tourism development identified
through the analysis included: (i) a lack of coordination and leadership in the tourism sector,
with a need for clearer identification of priorities within the sector and closer collaboration
between government agencies and the private sector in achieving these priorities; (ii) a lack of
institutional capacity and resources within the tourism bureau, with a need for improved
enabling legislation to support increased investor confidence and greater role clarity; and (iii)
an outdated and cumbersome regulatory environment, with processes for foreign investment
approval, establishing clear land titles, and the granting of business licensing needing to be
streamlined. The diagnostic study also identified lack of a substantial accommodation product
at a suitable price as a constraint on tourism sector development, with the absence of a large,
high quality hotel impeding broader volume-based development of the industry, including the
emergence of wholesale businesses in the tourism sector. Reforms to the business license
regime supported by this operation are likely to contribute to improvements in the regulatory
environment for tourism investment. Further improvements may be achieved through reforms
to foreign investment legislation, identified as a potential area of focus for possible future
operations.

65.     The ADB has played the lead role among development partners on analytical
work and technical assistance on public enterprise reform in Tonga. Tonga’s portfolio of
14 public enterprises currently includes 8 infrastructure service providers and 6 enterprises
engaged in commercial activities, with a combined asset value the equivalent of about 40
percent of GDP (in FY2008/09). The ADB’s latest benchmarking study of the performance of
public enterprises in the Pacific, Finding Balance, shows that Tonga’s public enterprises
outperform those of the other Pacific Islands in the study, with an average return on equity
between FY2001/02 and FY2008/09 of 6 percent and an average return on assets of 3.6
percent. Tonga has also set the pace for public enterprise reform, including through legislative
reforms, strengthened governance frameworks, restructuring of boards, and the rationalisation
and privatisation of public enterprises. Public enterprise reforms have slowed in the last year,
due to the difficulty involved in the next phase of reforms, which requires the consolidation of
existing reforms and further progress on the rationalisation and privatisation agenda.

66.     Analytical work by the IFC and the ADB has highlighted areas of Tonga’s
business licensing system that are in need of reform. The IFC, in its 2009 study Reviewing
the Business Licence in Tonga, reviews and provides recommendations on the reform of the
general business licence process and the nine activity-specific business licences that operate
in Tonga. The extent of the reform needed for the different licences vary, but one general
finding is that administrative resources are unduly focused on issuing licences, at the cost of
enforcing compliance with the terms of licences. Licensing is frequently used as an
enforcement tool for performance and compliance, when other means could be more cost
effective and less burdensome to the majority of businesses. The ADB’s recent Private Sector

                                               24
Assessment reinforces the message about the need to reform business licensing. This need will
be addressed through the business license reforms supported by this operation.

Poverty Analysis

67.      The Social Protection Issues Paper prepared for the MFNP by the ADB shows
that basic needs poverty in Tonga has risen over the last decade, and that there are
significant gaps in Tonga’s social protection framework. The paper analyses the results of
the 2009 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), to show the increase in basic
needs poverty since the 2001 HIES (see Table 3). The analysis shows poverty to be highest
outside Nuku’alofa on the main island, Tongatapu, but to have risen most sharply on Tonga’s
other islands. While the proportion of women with expenditure below the basic needs poverty
line is quite similar to the population averages in each region, the incidence of poverty among
children is notably higher. The paper highlights that a significant portion of the population
lives just above the basic needs poverty line, thus a small event could push many more
households below the poverty threshold. The paper shows that the Government provides good
access to basic education and health and gives annual grants to a number of non-government
organisations that provide social services to the disadvantaged.

V.       THE PROPOSED SECOND TONGA ECONOMIC RECOVERY OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
68.     The Second Tonga Economic Recovery operation is the second in a
programmatic series of two operations. The operation will be financed by IDA resources of
$1.8 million and AusAID is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0
million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank’s operation
being approved. The multi-year programmatic series of operations is designed to support the
Government of Tonga in implementing key aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, while
providing a predictable flow of resources in a challenging fiscal environment. The operations
are being implemented to help meet a clear need for budget support in the context of lingering
                                                        25
impacts of the GEC and the weak global recovery, including rising poverty, falling remittance
flows, a large contraction in tax revenues, and poor export performance. The operations
support the reform agenda of Tonga’s first majority-elected parliament at a critical juncture in
Tonga’s development process.

69.    The operation is timed to prevent the erosion of Tonga’s limited cash reserves
and avoid the need for disruptive cash-rationing. Government total cash balances were
TOP$25 million at the start of FY2012/13. The Budget for FY2012/13 is balanced on a cash
basis, based on projected budget support grants of TOP$22.5 million. Budget support
provided by donors is already likely to fall below budgeted levels by as much as TOP$10
million – an amount equivalent to 40 percent of current cash reserves. A delay in receipt of
budget support would place further pressure on cash resources, and see cash reserves fall to
around TOP$8 million (or around 2 weeks of recurrent expenditure) by the end of the third
quarter of the fiscal year, assuming no further external disruptions to revenue and no
unforeseen variance in expenditure. This would leave the Government of Tonga highly
vulnerable to any shocks, such as the unexpected continuation of declines in remittances
during the first months of the current fiscal year. While the Government of Tonga may have
some capacity to smooth cash-flows during the year through the issuing of Treasury bills, this
mechanism has not been recently utilized. A quickly-implemented bond issue would place
additional strain on already-overstretched treasury staff.

70.     The programmatic series of Tonga Economic Recovery Operations supports
three key elements of Tonga’s development agenda. These are: i) strengthening public
financial management; ii) strengthening fiscal policy; and iii) promoting structural reforms
relating to the business regulatory environment. The Second Tonga Economic Recovery
Operation builds on progress achieved through the previous operation, and maintains focus on
further key reforms in three of these areas of the Government’s reform agenda. In the area of
public financial management, priorities include strengthening PFM building blocks,
strengthening execution of the budget and increasing transparency of key budget processes.
Under fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on strengthening revenue effort in the context of
recent revenue declines. In relation to structural reform, the operation will support private
sector development through an improved business regulatory environment. The prior actions
supported by the program and the evidence provided of their completion are listed in the table
below.

                                  Prior Actions and Evidence of Completion
             POLICY AREA 1: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
1.   A Treasury Single Account has been implemented for all Government-funded operations, as
     evidenced by letter No. 69/7/2/238 from the Minister of Finance, dated September 11, 2012 received by the
     Association.
2.   Quarterly reports have been made available on the Ministry of Finance and National Planning
     website on a timely basis (within 45 days of the end of the reporting period), as evidenced by the
     publication on August 10, 2012 of same for the period ending on June 30 2012.
3.   The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the submission to Parliament of the audited Financial
     Statements of Government up to FY2010/11 as evidenced by the Cabinet minutes No 813 and the
     Cabinet minutes No 814, both dated September 18, 2012.
                        POLICY AREA 2: STRENGTHENING FISCAL POLICY
4.   Details regarding the cost by category of tax expenditure during the previous year have been
     published in the annual Budget Statement for FY2012/13, as evidenced by the Budget Statement dated
     June 2012 received by the Association.
5.   The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the introduction of a presumptive tax for SMEs, consistent
     with the recommendations of the PFTAC Tax Review , as evidenced by the Cabinet minutes No 781,
     dated September 14, 2012.
6.   The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the introduction of a natural resource revenue regime,
     consistent with the recommendations of the PFTAC Tax Review, as evidenced by the Cabinet minutes
     No. 781 dated September 14, 2012.
                       POLICY AREA 3: PROMOTING STRUCTURAL REFORM
7.   The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the submission to Parliament of legislative changes to reduce
     the number of business license classes and extend license duration, as evidenced by the Cabinet
     minutes No.810, dated September 14, 2012.


71.     Continuation of the series through a second operation is appropriate given
progress achieved to date and continued need for budget support assistance. While some
triggers specified under the first operation have been missed, the Government of Tonga has
made substantial progress under all areas of the reform agenda. Delays in progress in the
electricity sector clearly reflect implementation problems, rather than a lack of Government
commitment to reform. Broader progress in both the petroleum and electricity sector has been
achieved. Progress against specified actions is considered sufficient to achieve the
development objectives of the program. At the same time, ongoing macroeconomic
challenges have elicited renewed commitment to key economic and fiscal reforms, including
key reforms in areas supported by the Bank program, while necessitating ongoing budget
support. With remittance flows continuing to decline, loan-financed construction projects
coming to an end, consumption remaining sluggish, and large debt repayment obligations
coming due, grant support needs to be maintained at levels seen over previous years to avoid
either an unsustainable deterioration of the macroeconomic framework or substantial declines
in declines in delivery of vital services.




                                                      27
72.     Technical assistance is being provided to support the achievement of several
policy actions. Reflecting the extent and seriousness of capacity constraints in key areas of
reform, technical assistance from various donors is being provided to assist in the
implementation of several policy actions (Annex 4). Provision of this technical assistance is
likely to contribute to capacity building in key reform areas, although the extent to which
sustainable capacity building can be achieved will be limited by small staff numbers and high
staff turnover, typical of Pacific contexts. It is therefore likely that continued technical
assistance will remain critical to support reforms under any possible future operations.

73.     Consistent with the approach proposed during the first operation, the decision to
proceed with a second operation has been based on an assessment of overall progress
across reform areas. Substantial progress has been achieved in all policy areas supported by
the Bank through the previous operation. Some specific triggers have not been met due to
delays, often beyond the control of the Government of Tonga, or changes in policy focus
within a fluid economic and political context. In other cases, targets established as triggers
have already been met or exceeded. Accordingly, there have been changes between the prior
actions used for the Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation and those specified as
triggers under the first operation. Reasons for changes from the triggers are provided in Table
5.

74.     Policy actions have been updated to reflect the extent of progress. In relation to
public financial management, DPO II prior actions relating to publication of quarterly reports
and publication by gazette of the financial statements of Government have been adjusted from
DPO I triggers, and a new action relating to the introduction of a Treasury Single Account has
been added, to reflect faster-than-expected progress against previously-identified triggers. In
relation to structural reform, DPO I triggers relating to the introduction of a revised electricity
tariff and the privatization of the Dateline Hotel have been dropped, due to slower-than-
expected progress to date. An additional DPO II prior action, relating to business license
reform, has been added, reflecting the extent of progress in other areas of the Government’s
structural reform agenda. The DPO I trigger relating to the community public works scheme
has not been included. Given that policy decisions regarding implementation of the
community public works scheme have now been made, implementation is considered to be
best pursued through project-level engagement. The Bank has reviewed, with the authorities
and development partners, the progress in the implementation of the reform program and,
considering the areas of faster than expected progress as well as those with slower than
expected progress, has found overall progress to be robust (see Table 5). The Bank expects
that the reforms and policy implementation through the actions supported by both the first and
the second operation will cumulatively help Tonga achieve the development objectives of its
reform program supported by this series of operations.

75.    As during the previous operation, the Bank has coordinated dialogue between
Government and development partners to produce a joint policy matrix. The Bank has
worked with Government and development partners in coordinating the formulation of a joint
policy matrix (see Annex 5). AusAID is providing budget support for actions included in the
joint matrix, while the ADB, PFTAC, EU, and the IMF have also been closely involved in the
policy discussion. PFTAC and ADB are providing technical assistance to the Government of
Tonga in implementing included actions. Coordinated dialogue has brought benefits in terms
of ensuring strong Government ownership but also required flexibility on the behalf of
development partners in agreeing detailed content of reform actions that aligns with
Government priorities.

76.     Decisions regarding future budget support will be made in light of country
developments and dialogue with Government and development partners. The nature and
scope of any possible program underpinning future Bank budget support remains to be
determined. A possible future program of support from the Bank could be tightly aligned with
an extension of reforms supported through the current operation (including energy sector
reforms and the Dateline hotel). However, program content will remain flexible and fluid,
given Tonga’s evolving economic and political context. Any final decisions regarding future
program design will reflect ongoing dialogue with Government and other development
partners through existing joint-donor dialogue processes. ADB, AusAID, and the EU are
likely to be providing budget support during 2013.

Box 1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership – Policy actions are aligned with the priorities of the TSDF as explained in
the section on “Government’s program and participatory processes?. Prior actions reflect broader consultation
with the private sector, through the Tonga Economic Dialogue. The Tongan Cabinet has been consistently
involved in the development of the joint policy matrix and has approved the content of the matrix at key stages.
Joint donor budget support has been provided to Tonga for several years, and the recent track record of success
in implementing agreed prior actions and broader policy reforms demonstrates ownership and commitment to
reform progress (see Annex 5). Extensive analytical work underpins the selection of policy actions as explained
in the section on “analytical underpinnings?.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework – The Bank has worked to coordinate between Government and donors in developing a joint policy
matrix providing coordinated accountability for the current operation and the previous operation. Bank and
AusAID financing is being mobilized to support a harmonized set of actions included in the joint policy matrix
in FY13. The joint policy matrix has now been accepted by development partners as a joint basis for budget
support in FY14 and future years. The joint policy matrix is included as Annex 5.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances – The modality and timing of support is well suited to country needs as described in the “country
context? section and the “operation description? section. Largely due to exogenous economic shocks, Tonga
faces a need for immediate budget support assistance to offset revenue declines and avoid deterioration in the
provision of vital services and an associated reduction in living standards. The timing of the operation reflects
the need to avoid an undesirable depletion of fiscal buffers in the context of ongoing global economic
uncertainty. Identified policy actions are intended to support implementation of Government reform priorities
while providing a much-needed flow of fiscal resources at a critical juncture in Tonga’s development trajectory.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement – Policy
                                                      31
actions have been subject to extensive consultation with Government and donors. These consultations have been
undertaken with an explicit objective of minimizing the number of supported reforms while ensuring the
achievement of program development objectives. The choice of a limited set of seven high-impact policy actions
reflects both the importance of these actions to the achievement of improved fiscal sustainability, strengthened
economic development, and greater transparency in Government operations, while also taking account of the
extent of capacity and resource constraints facing Government in implementing policy reforms.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support – The joint policy matrix process has been developed to a regular cycle that aligns with the
Government’s budget process and provides for disbursement in accordance with cash-flow needs. Bank and
AusAID monitoring and evaluation processes are entirely aligned and the joint donor process is intended to
achieve predictability in budget support. Within inevitable data constraints, reviews are focused on results
achieved, based on the Bank’s operation policy matrix.




POLICY AREAS

Strengthening Public Financial Management

(i) First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

77.     To strengthen budget execution, the First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation
supported the introduction of an in-year budget reporting system that tracks key budget
information on a monthly and quarterly basis. Prior to the implementation of this system
at the beginning of FY2011/12, the Government lacked an adequate analytical tool for
identifying major in-year deviations from the approved budget. Cash forecasts and actual
expenditure reports were prepared separately, and were produced infrequently and seldom in a
timely manner. With World Bank technical assistance, the Government built consensus
around the appropriate format for monthly and quarterly monitoring reports and developed the
capacity to sustain the ongoing production of these reports.

78.     Implementation of the new reporting system has exceeded expectations. Reports
have been consistently produced on a monthly basis. As well as information on revenues,
expenditure, and balances, reports also identify problems with budget execution within
ministries, track use of the contingency fund, and monitor unbudgeted expenditure. Reports
have been used extensively by the budget team in interactions with Ministers, with quarterly
reports used as the basis for the mid-year budget review report and presentation to Cabinet.
All monthly reports are also presented to Cabinet, contributing to increased awareness of
expenditure constraints in the current environment, and supporting improvements in overall
fiscal management, such as the recent successes in reducing the extent of inappropriate draw-
downs from the Contingency Fund.

79.    To strengthen budget transparency, the First Tonga Economic Recovery
Operation supported reform of the budget calendar so as to make budget proposals
available to the public when tabled in the Legislative Assembly. Prior to these reforms, the
budget was only made public after it had been approved by the Legislative Assembly. In the
                                            32
absence of access to the budget proposal, the public and civil society groups were not able to
engage in debate regarding its contents and it was impossible to identify stages at which key
changes to the budget were introduced. Reforms were effective not only in supporting
increased transparency, but also encouraging greater Cabinet engagement in the development
of the budget proposal. Increased Cabinet ownership of the budget has supported greater
consideration of the detrimental impacts of unplanned in-year transfers across ministries, and
strengthened the credibility of the budget.

(ii) Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

80.      To improve the management of cash flows, a Treasury Single Account has been
implemented for all Government operations. Government has maintained momentum over
several years in closing redundant bank accounts and retiring various revolving funds that
undermined the clarity of budget data and documentation. Progress in this regard has allowed
Government to substantially improve its capacity to monitor and control cash-flows and
facilitated the streamlining of regular bank reconciliations. During March, 2012, 45 bank
accounts were closed or consolidated into the Government’s five main accounts (an operating
account, a government development account, a national emergency fund account, a National
Reserve Bank account, and a development fund account for donor funds). Following
substantial consolidation of accounts over recent years, this action is considered to bring
Tonga into compliance with best-practice criteria for a Treasury Single Account, with a
unified structure of accounts that enables consolidation and better utilization of government
cash balances. While development partners continue to require the maintenance of several
separate project accounts, cash resources under Government control are now fully fungible
across various resourcing needs, with complete cash balance information across Government
accounts provided to the MFNP on a daily basis.

81.     To strengthen budget execution and transparency, quarterly reports have been
made available on the MFNP website on a timely basis (within 45 days of the end of the
reporting period). While monthly and quarterly reports have been prepared reliably, and to a
high quality standard, there have previously been substantial delays between the end of a
reporting period and the publication of the relevant report. This has somewhat limited the
usefulness of the reports in informing immediate budgeting decisions and reduced
transparency of deviations from the budget over the short-term. Under the Second Economic
Recovery Operation, the MFNP has made quarterly reports available on the MFNP website
within 45 days of the end of the relevant reporting period. This action has required delays to
be reduced in the time taken for the MFNP to collate the required data and prepare the report,
the time taken for Cabinet to clear the report for publication, and the time taken by the MFNP
to place the report on the website. The transparency and accountability yielded by this action
will help further strengthen budget execution, including through reinforcing incipient demand
for budget execution information from NGOs and civil society. Government is already
planning training for Cabinet Ministers and senior public servants in the use and interpretation

of published reports, with such training intended to be provided to civil society groups and
NGOs over the next year, leveraging additional transparency and accountability benefits.

82.     To further strengthen transparency, the Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the
submission to Parliament of the audited Financial Statements of Government up to
FY2010/11. Annual Financial Statements of Government were omitted from the coverage of
the Auditor General’s Annual Report during FY2009/10 and FY2010/11. Auditing of the
FY2009/10 Annual Financial Statements was delayed by a special Parliamentary Committee
enquiry into misuse of ministry-administered bank accounts. With the enquiry now complete,
rapid progress has been achieved. Annual Financial Statements for both FY2009/10 and
FY2010/11 have been completed and audited, and Cabinet has approved the submission of the
Audited Financial Statements of Government to Parliament during its next sitting. This
establishes a new precedent for compliance with basic transparency and accountability
standards through the audit process and will help embed increased accountability under the
new political system.

83.     Supported reforms have occurred in the context of broader efforts to strengthen
budget execution and transparency. The Government has successfully improved aggregate
budget execution and realized a cash surplus of around TOP$20 million in FY2011/12. While
also reflecting improvements in revenue performance and higher-than expected budget
support grants, this result has been supported by greater discipline in the use of the
Contingency Fund. The amount allocated to the fund was reduced to TOP$3.2 million in
FY2011/12 (from $6.7 million in FY2010/11), and only $2.1 million of this amount was
accessed during the year. The Government has also made substantial progress in budget
transparency. The budget proposal, as submitted by Cabinet to Parliament, was publically
released on the MFNP for the first time during the FY2012/13 budget process. The MFNP is
currently preparing a series of information sessions on interpretation of budget documentation
and upcoming expenditure management challenges. The audience will initially be restricted to
Cabinet Ministers and Chief Executives of Ministries, with additional sessions for civil
society organizations and NGOs planned for next year. These training sessions are expected
to leverage the accountability benefits of progress in publishing quarterly budget reports,
quarterly debt reports, the annual budget statement, and the approved estimates on the MFNP
website.

(iii) Possible subsequent operations and expected outcomes

84.     To improve budget execution, any possible subsequent operation could support
the revision of the chart of accounts to provide improved control and greater
transparency in resource allocation decisions. The Government is implementing a major
public service restructuring for the 2012/13 fiscal year. This restructuring will include the
separation and combination of several ministries, and accompanying changes to ministry roles
and responsibilities. The Bank and ADB are currently providing a range of technical
assistance to the Public Service Commission and the MFNP to support the restructuring,
                                             34
including work to ensure that: i) new ministry structures, roles and responsibilities are
accurately represented in corporate plans; and ii) the outputs of ministries specified in
corporate plans align to ministry programs and sub-programs resourced through the budget,
with resources commensurate to delivery of clearly-defined outputs being provided. Progress
in this direction would represent a major improvement in the transparency and control of
resource allocation decisions over the current budget framework, under which ministries are
granted discretion over the movement of money within a very small number of often-large
and inadequately defined programs that do not align to service delivery responsibilities
articulated in corporate plans.

85.     Broader public financial management reforms are planned. The Government of
Tonga engaged technical assistance from PFTAC and the ADB during 2012 to develop a
PFM reform roadmap, based on the most recent PEFA assessment. The roadmap will outline
a prioritized and sequenced program of PFM reforms – supporting a gradual movement
towards policy-based budgeting within a sustainable medium-term framework and with clear
links between the budget and various planning documents – to address the greatest current
challenges to macroeconomic management and improved service delivery. Implementation of
key elements of the roadmap could be supported through possible future budget support from
the Bank or other development partners.

86.     Over the medium term, the supported reforms are expected to improve the
credibility of the budget and increase public access to key fiscal information. On budget
credibility, the measure chosen as a monitoring indicator is the composition of the
expenditure outturn relative to the approved budget (PEFA Indicator 2). In conjunction with
the wider PFM reforms being undertaken by the Government, improving budget monitoring
through the in-year reporting system is expected to strengthen budget execution and bring
actual outturns closer to the approved budget. Over the last decade, the Government’s
performance on PEFA Indicator 2 has been a 0–5 percent deviation in four years, a 5–10
percent deviation in three years, and a 10–15 percent deviation in three years (equivalent to a
‘C’). The medium term target is to reduce deviation to 0–5 percent in most years (a ‘B’). On
public access to key fiscal information, PEFA Indicator 10 has been chosen as a monitoring
indicator. To date, the public has had timely access to only one of the six specified key budget
documents comprising the indicator (equivalent to a ‘C’). The medium term target is to
increase this to three documents (a ‘B’).

Strengthening Fiscal Policy

(i) First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

87.     To improve the management of the public sector wage bill, the First Tonga
Economic Recovery Operation supported measures to bring recruitment in all parts of
the public service under centralized control, and applied a partial hiring freeze. Tonga
has historically faced major challenges in the management of its wage bill. In the context of
                                              35
revenue pressure and expenditure control measures, inadequate control over the wage bill
contributed to a squeeze on non-wage expenditure. Between FY2008/09 and FY2010/11, the
wage bill as a proportion of government-funded expenditure (excluding debt service) rose
from 41.6 percent to 58.0 percent. While wage increases played a major part in driving
expenditure increases, inadequate central-agency control over recruitment by some agencies
also led to unchecked expansion in the number of civil service positions.

88.     Control measures have proven largely successful. A Treasury Circular was issued
in the third quarter of 2011, specifying that: i) the MFNP must confirm availability of funds
before any new recruitment or filling of existing positions could take place, with PSC
providing advice on the need for the new position; and ii) recruitment to existing vacant
positions was to only proceed if the position was at a technical level and vital to service
delivery, and if options for internal redeployment had been exhausted. While some ministries
have filled vacant positions that are not in accordance with the Treasury Circular, they have
generally done so after the MFNP has provided confirmation of the availability of funds.
Centralized control over new recruitments has been generally maintained, although a small
number of new positions have been created through the year in Ministries of Health,
Agriculture, Police, and Foreign Affairs without MFNP approval. The FY2012/13 Budget
Circular includes a statement of Government policy to reduce the wage bill to 45 percent of
recurrent expenditure. FY2012/13 Budget allocations reflect this policy, with wage-bill
allocations declining as a share of total recurrent expenditure. The hiring freeze remains in
place as the Government moves to consolidate the restructure of ministries implemented at the
beginning of the fiscal year, with hiring only to resume once resourcing needs under the new
structure have been carefully considered by the MFNP and the Public Service Commission.

(ii) Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

89.     To further strengthen fiscal policy, the Recipient’s Cabinet has implemented or
approved various reforms recommended by the recent tax policy and administration
review. As an outcome of dialogue around budget support, development partners agreed to
support Government in undertaking a major review of tax policy and administration during
FY2011/12. This review was completed in late 2011, and – consistent with DPO I triggers –
DPO II will support as prior actions implementation of several reforms recommended by this
review.

90.    To improve processes and transparency in the granting of exemptions, details
regarding the cost by category of tax expenditure during the previous year have been
published in the annual Budget Statement for FY2012/13. The total cost of various tax
exemptions was estimated at TOP$44.6 million for the period July 2009 to August 2011
(equivalent to 17 percent of total recurrent expenditure in FY2011/12). The current
exemptions regime includes some measures that serve a legitimate policy purpose, but the
Government considers that there remains significant scope to reduce the costs of exemptions
through improved processes and transparency. Under the Second Economic Recovery
                                             36
Operation, the total costs of tax expenditure were published in the annual budget statement,
disaggregated by the exemption classification. With World Bank Technical Assistance, the
Budget Unit provided an explanation of current costs and recent trends in relation to specific
tax expenditure items. Inclusion of this information in the Budget Statement will continue in
subsequent years. This level of transparency is expected to ensure greater rigor and
consistency with policy in the granting of exemptions, while providing information by which
the public can assess the benefits of such exemptions against their costs.

91.     To encourage tax compliance and reduce administrative burdens on Tonga
Revenue Services, the Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the introduction of a
presumptive tax for SMEs, consistent with the recommendations of the PFTAC Tax
Review. The existing tax regime for small and medium enterprises is onerous in Tonga. All
businesses, regardless of size are required to keep the same records and prepare the same
accounts. Compliance costs are high for businesses, discouraging registration and compliance,
and for Revenue Services, which diverts scarce capacity into processing small business taxes,
at the expense of improved surveillance over large tax-payers. To address this, Cabinet has
approved introduction of a presumptive tax for SMEs. The presumptive tax will apply a lump
sum tax for businesses with turnover less than a low specified level, and a low percent tax on
gross turnover for small businesses with turnover above this level. Small businesses will
retain the ability to opt into the standard income tax, but would be required to stay in the
regime for an extended period of time and would have to adhere to the income tax record
keeping requirements. The new tax regime will impose a roughly equivalent liability on
SMEs as under the current system, but substantially reduce associated compliance costs. The
Government is committed to the implementation of these reforms by mid-2014, following the
provision of necessary technical assistance on specific design issues, and a suitable program
of consultation and communication. The next step is Cabinet agreement to specific rates and
levels for the new tax, scheduled for March, 2013.

92.      To ensure that benefits of prospective natural resource investments are
maximized, the Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the introduction of a natural resource
revenue regime. Tonga has significant natural resource endowments, including forestry
(mainly sandalwood) and fisheries. To date, the absence of a clear natural resource tax
framework has prevented Tonga from maximizing returns from associated extractive
industries. With recent World Bank and IMF analysis emphasizing the likely continuing
importance of natural resource industries to Tonga’s economic development, and current
prospecting underway for undersea mineral deposits, government has identified the need to
introduce an appropriate natural resource revenue regime. Accordingly, Government has
approved the introduction of an international best-practice framework, consisting of: i) an ad
valorem royalty, with a rate in the range of 2 to 4 percent for minerals and around 10 percent
for oil, applied to the freight on board export price of the minerals; the corporate income tax
(CIT); and a resource rent tax (RRT) with a tax rate in the range of 20 to 35 percent, and an
accumulation rate in the range of 15 to 25 percent. Cabinet has also approved a timetable for
                                              37
the implementation of the natural resource tax regime, with legislation expected to be enacted
late in 2013. Ensuring the existence of a transparent and appropriate revenue regime will help
attract much-needed investment in prospective natural resource industries while ensuring a
fair share of natural resource wealth is retained by the people of Tonga. While offshore
mining prospects remain uncertain, regional experience indicates the importance of
establishing revenue frameworks prior to natural resource investments, in order to avoid
arbitrary and ad hoc arrangements around individual investments. The Government is
committed to this reform, based on strong support from the Ministry of Labor, Commerce and
Industry and industry groups, and the high priority accorded to this work in the recent PFTAC
review.

93.     DPO II prior actions have occurred in the context of broader efforts to improve
fiscal policy. Cabinet has agreed to a number of measures to control expenditure growth and
better prioritize resources. These measures are informed by the recently-completed
expenditure analysis work by the MFNP with World Bank technical assistance.10 On the
expenditure side, several measures to improve the quality of expenditure are included in the
2012/13 budget guidance including: i) the maintenance of the current hiring freeze until the
completion of the Government restructure; ii) the establishment of a process for ensuring
appropriate reallocation of staff under the restructure; iii) the continued commitment to a
policy target to reduce payroll costs to 45 percent of recurrent expenditure; and iv) a
requirement that all new spending proposals are aligned with priorities identified in ministry
corporate plans. Accordingly, the FY2012/13 Budget included several positive expenditure
measures, including a reduction in the proportion of recurrent expenditure dedicated to wages
and salaries, a further reduction in appropriation to the Contingency Fund (to TOP$2.0
million from TOP$3.2 million in FY2011/12), and a general rebalancing of expenditure
towards health and education. On the revenue side, recent additional reform measures include:
i) a Cabinet decision to “review existing exemptions with a view to terminating them in order
to increase revenues and remove distortions?; and ii) plans to reinstate a exemptions
committee – staffed by senior officials, including the Secretary of Finance – to advise the
Cabinet Economic Development Committee on the eligibility of exemption applications under
existing legislative provisions.

(iii) Possible subsequent operations and expected outcomes

94.     Possible subsequent operations may support additional key steps towards the
introduction of a presumptive tax for SMEs and the introduction of an appropriate
natural resource revenue regime. Agreed changes to the SME regime and the development
of a natural resource revenue regime will take time, and possible subsequent operations could
support additional steps towards the end of legal implementation. Such steps could include the
completion of required consultation and communication processes, the drafting of legislative
changes, or the presentation of revised legislation to parliament.

10
     Findings of this work are summarized in the “Analytical Underpinnings? section.
                                                        38
95.      Over the medium term, the reforms supported by the current multi-year
programmatic series of operations are expected to enable the Government to keep its
actual wage bill in line with the budget and to reduce the cost of exemptions as a
proportion of consumption tax and import duty revenues. With respect to the wage bill,
the monitoring indicator chosen is the variation between the actual wage bill and the budget.
Over the last decade, this has averaged approximately 3.7 percent (excluding the year of the
civil service strike and major wage settlement). The medium term target is to reduce this
variation to below 2.5 percent. This target was achieved in FY2011/12, with recurrent
Government wage expenditure within 1 percent of budget allocations. A new indicator has
been added under the Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation to take account of the
new emphasis on revenue reforms. The monitoring indicator for tax changes is cost of
exemptions as a proportion of total consumption tax and duty revenues. The medium-term
target is no further increases from a FY2010/11 baseline of 30 percent.

Promoting Structural Reform

(i) First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

96.      The First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported the approval of
guiding principles for reforming the electricity tariff structure, aimed at a financially
sustainable and efficient electricity sector, taking into account the planned shift to
renewable energy, with adequate protection for the poorest consumers. The Bank has
been heavily engaged in the Tongan energy sector and the implementation of the Tonga
Energy Roadmap, and is supporting reforms in the electricity and petroleum sectors. The
design of the existing electricity tariff presents obstacles to achieving Tonga’s energy policy
objectives. Under the current tariff design, the utility – Tonga Power Limited – can fully
recoup its diesel costs through electricity tariffs and therefore lacks a strong incentive to buy
electricity from cost-effective renewable suppliers. Incentives to minimize the cost of its
petroleum imports or use diesel inputs more efficiently could be strengthened. In addition, the
existing electricity tariff does not provide any protection to the least-well off electricity
consumers, in the form of a lifeline tariff or similar fully-funded community service
obligation. The absence of any protection for the poor contributes to political resistance to oil
price rises being passed on in electricity tariffs, particularly in times of hardship. Given that
TPL is a wholly state-owned enterprise, this places a significant financial risk on the
Government. The First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported a decision by
Government to review the tariff according to guiding principles that would see the
introduction of strengthened incentives for cost-effective renewable generation and a life-line
tariff to protect the poorest electricity consumers. Explicit Cabinet agreement to the review
was obtained in the second quarter of 2011.




                                               39
97.      Progress with implementing the review has been slower than expected due to
capacity-constraints within Government, delays in the provision of technical assistance,
and growing ambition for broader reforms. Implementation of a new tariff was specified
as an indicative trigger for the Second Economic Recovery operation. The TERM
Implementation Unit (TERM-IU), as directed by Government, has worked closely with the
World Bank and Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center (PIAC) over the past year to mobilize
technical assistance to support a review of the existing electricity tariff, as a precondition for
tariff reform. Terms of reference for the review have now been finalized and a team of
consultants have begun analysis. The delay in implementing the review reflects: i)
administrative difficulties faced by donor agencies in identifying consultants considered
appropriate by all parties and determining contracting arrangements for the current technical
assistance; ii) postponement of the initial review mission due to the threat of a no-confidence
motion against Government; and iii) some overstretching of TERM-IU’s very limited capacity
(TERM-IU had a total of less than three full-time-equivalent staff for most of the Calendar
year), given competing demands for work to determine and secure Cabinet agreement to its
institutional status and responsibilities. Government remains committed to implementing the
findings of the current review as soon as feasible, and has also committed to a broader review
of current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the Tongan electricity sector to feed
into renegotiation of the current Tonga Power Limited (TPL) contract.

98.     The First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported amending the
petroleum pricing templates to ensure that consumer prices are an accurate reflection of
existing costs. As part of its broader support to the TERM, the Bank has conducted two major
studies of the petroleum sector.11 The Government has formulated and approved an action
plan to guide the implementation of the recommendations of the studies over the medium
term. These studies recommended independent reviews of the LPG and petroleum pricing
templates, to increase the transparency of the templates and provide a basis for adjusting the
templates to ensure that consumer prices are an accurate reflection of existing cost structures.
The previous operation supported amendments to the template based on these reviews, which
delivered significant benefits to consumers. The retailers’ margin had been set on a
percentage basis, which had imposed a significant penalty on consumers during periods of
high oil prices. It is now set on a per liter basis.

99.     The First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported the publication of the
audited accounts of designated major public enterprises. In recent years, the Government
has made progress with public enterprise reforms geared at moving public enterprises onto a
more commercial footing.12 A critical aspect of the Government’s reforms to date has been
strengthening the regulatory framework for public enterprises. In late 2010, the Public
Enterprise Act was amended to assign a commercial objective to public enterprises, enhance
corporate governance, strengthen the monitoring framework for public enterprises, clarify the

     For the financial status of Tonga’s public enterprises, see the ‘Analytical Underpinnings’ section.
                                                          40
rules and processes associated with the approval of community service obligations, establish
clear guidelines on the selection and appointment of directors, and clarify director
accountabilities. The Government has also been restructuring public enterprises, with a view
to privatising those for which a strong rationale for public ownership does not exist. The First
Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported the publication of audited financial reports
from six major public enterprises, following substantial preliminary work in bringing
accounts up to date and mobilizing the required auditing expertise. The six major public
enterprises whose accounts have now been published are Tonga Power Limited, the Tonga
Water Board, Tonga Airports Limited, the Ports Authority of Tonga, Tonga Post Limited and
the Tonga Development Bank. These six major public enterprises now serve as examples of
financial transparency for the smaller enterprises in the portfolio. This was the first time that
the audited accounts of public enterprises were made publicly available, in line with a new
requirement enacted as part of the recent legislative reforms.

100. Introduction of private participation in the operation of the Dateline Hotel has
been delayed to allow more careful consideration of policy options. The poor performance
of the International Dateline Hotel under an earlier joint-venture arrangement has held back
the development of the tourism sector in Tonga. The Dateline is the largest hotel in
Nuku’alofa and, if adequate quality standards were achieved, the business could play a
strategic role in the broader development of the tourism industry by providing a hub for
ancillary tourism businesses and wholesalers. Bringing the Dateline Hotel to the point of
transaction was specified as a trigger for the current operation, on the assumption that the
hotel would be fully privatized. Government, however, is now considering a broader range of
options for private participation, including the introduction of a management contract. The
Government remains committed to increasing the value Tonga derives from the Dateline hotel
through a return to private management, but wishes to ensure that the most suitable ownership
arrangements are in place. A liquidator was engaged in 2011 to conclude the previous joint-
venture arrangement, and clear the way for the Government to pursue privatization. Legal
issues surrounding the prior joint venture arrangements significantly delayed this process, and
Government’s sole ownership of the asset has only recently been confirmed. Given these
delays, full consideration of policy options and implementation of a transaction was not
achievable within the timeframes of the current operation. The IFC is now working with the
Ministry of Public Enterprises to consider appropriate private participation models. IFC will
also help Government in developing and testing the financial viability of investment
requirements, and undertaking due diligence on potential investors.

(ii) Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation

101. The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the submission to Parliament of legislative
changes to reduce the number of business license classes and extend license duration.
Existing business licensing arrangements in Tonga are onerous and discourage private sector
development and foreign investment. Licenses are issued for activities rather than for

                                               41
businesses, and with more than 100 activities listed in regulations, nearly all businesses are
required to obtain multiple licenses. The duration of business licenses is typically restricted to
one or two years, creating additional compliance costs and uncertainty for investors through
the requirement for regular re-application. To address this situation, Cabinet has approved
submission to Parliament of legislative revisions to allow businesses to: i) hold a single
license for all activities, with a single application fee and process; and ii) be granted licenses
in perpetuity. These measures will represent a substantial reduction in compliance costs faced
by businesses in Tonga and contribute to reducing investor uncertainty and enhancing
Tonga’s reputation as a place to do business.

102.   Progress on other fronts continues in the energy sector. While specified triggers in
the energy sector have not been met, Government remains committed to reform in this area,
and progress is occurring. TERM-IU now has a full complement of staff, following the
appointment of a new, permanent, Director in August to replace the departing Interim
Director. World Bank technical assistance has been accessed to assist in the development of a
petroleum sector review, and a least-cost energy development plan, building on the tariff
review that is already underway. Work has also begun on the development of a new Energy
Act and established a technical committee to facilitate cooperation and consistency in
approach with TPL, the national utility. In accordance with Government policy, TERM-IU
has overseen regulatory arrangements for Tonga’s first major solar Independent Power
Provider (IPP) project (a 1MW photovoltaic system developed by New Zealand firm,
Meridian) and developed a pipeline for further renewable IPP projects.

103.     Broader SOE and business climate reforms are also underway. DPO II prior
actions form only a small component of the Government’s current structural reform agenda.
SOE reform is proceeding with extensive ADB assistance across a broad portfolio. Recent
examples of progress include: i) the recent re-advertisement for sale of the state-owned
fisheries company, Seastar, as a going concern or the lease of its assets; ii) improved
commercial performance of Tonga Post following recent restructuring; iii) improved
commercial performance of Tonga Forest Products under revised SOE legislative and policy
framework; and iv) ongoing policy work to support private participation in Tonga Print and
Tonga Investments Limited. The Government is also working closely with the ADB to
improve a range of aspects of the regulatory business environment. Recent advances in this
area include: i) the planned presentation to Parliament by the end of the year of a revised law
for personal insolvency, to fill important gaps in the current legal framework; and ii) the
initiation of policy consultations regarding a planned revision of the foreign investment act to
reduce compliance costs and increase certainty for investors.




                                               42
(iii) Possible subsequent operations and expected outcomes

104.     Any possible subsequent operation may support the implementation of a new
electricity tariff that, inter alia, provides for full cost recovery, establishes financial
incentives to generate and distribute electricity efficiently, and institutes a lifeline tariff.
As discussed above, progress in carrying out the planned review of the electricity tariff has
been slower than expected, due to the diversion of the small number of staff within TERM-IU
towards obtaining Cabinet agreement to the unit’s formal role and function, delays in
identifying and engaging appropriate consultants, and Government’s shift in policy focus
towards a more wide-ranging review of institutional arrangements within the electricity sector
(which is to include a review the broader regulatory framework within which the utility
operates, rather than just the design of the tariff within the existing framework). With the
tariff review now underway, and reform of the existing tariff design still integral to broader
reform direction, the implementation of a new tariff – consistent with the objectives
previously specified by cabinet – could be supported under any possible subsequent operation.

105. The authorities are prioritizing further reforms in the energy sector. Government,
in the Letter of Development Policy, has indicated its intention to pursue key reform steps in
the energy sector over the coming 18 months that could form part of any subsequent budget
support operations undertaken by the Bank or other development partners. These include: i)
Cabinet approval of recommendations arising from a petroleum sector review undertaken by
TERM-IU, potentially including significant changes to the current regulatory and legislative
framework for petroleum supply and distribution; ii) Cabinet approval of a least-cost energy
plan to guide the development of generation capacity; iii) achievement of specified renewable
energy generation targets of up to 15 percent of total energy supplied to the grid; and iv) key
steps towards the implementation of a new Energy Act, which will establish a broad
legislative framework for achievement of TERM targets and objectives.

106. Further steps towards private participation in the management of the Dateline
Hotel could also be supported in possible future operations. While progress has been
delayed by recent legal processes, Government remains committed to strengthening the
management of the Dateline Hotel through some form of private participation. This
commitment has been reiterated in the Letter of Development Policy. Any possible
subsequent operation could support the implementation of private participation arrangements
following Government’s full consideration of policy options and due diligence processes with
IFC assistance.

107. Government approval of policy principals and process for revising the Foreign
Investment Act is also on the reform agenda. The improvements to business licensing
arrangements supported under the previous operation will achieve maximum impact if
combined with reforms of existing foreign investment rules. Substantial transaction costs and
uncertainty will continue to exist for foreign investors under the improved business licensing

                                              43
regime, given existing requirements for investors to gain separate clearances, involving
multiple processes and high a degree of ministerial discretion, under the Foreign Investment
Act. The Government is committed to reforming foreign investment legislation and
consultations on a revised Act are due to commence in the third quarter of 2012. Any possible
subsequent operation could support Government agreements to a process and guiding
principles for the review and subsequent presentation of revised legislation to Parliament.
Given the need for extensive consultation and legislative drafting, the passing of revised
legislation is unlikely to be achievable until early 2014.

108. Reforms in relation to public enterprises and the business license regime are
expected to deliver sustained improvements in the financial accountability of SOEs and
a reduction in the time taken to open a business. Business license reforms are expected to
yield an improvement in the ease of entry for new businesses, as reflected in a reduction in the
time taken to start a business in the next Doing Business Survey results from a baseline of 16
days. The program of public enterprise reforms is expected to deliver continued compliance
with financial reporting requirements on behalf of designated major public enterprises.

Improving Social Protection

109. The First Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported adoption of a
community public works program targeted to poor and vulnerable communities. In order
to arrest further increases in poverty and protect the integrity of traditional systems, the First
Tonga Economic Recovery Operation supported the adoption of a community public works
scheme targeted to poor and vulnerable communities. With technical assistance from the
Bank, the Government approved a community public works program to provide grant funds to
communities for labor-intensive public works projects they propose. The project design
contains wage-labor components, to enable the participation of the poorest individuals and
provide them with a temporary income support cash injection.

110. Progress in implementing the Community Public Works Scheme has been
delayed. Implementation of the community public works program was included as a trigger
for the Second Tonga Economic Recovery Operation. Substantial progress has been achieved
towards implementation of the project, including recent Cabinet approval of detailed design
features and targeting and the selection of NGO groups to oversee implementation. However,
there have been delays in securing the financing to support the implementation of the scheme.
In the coming months, the World Bank will continue to work with Government to further
progress with the implementation of the program. The Government of Tonga remains
committed to improving social protection systems, with the recent introduction of a Social
Benefit Scheme providing direct payments to the elderly and ongoing work with the ADB and
the EU to implement additional social protection programs to protect marginalized
communities and the disabled.

                        VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND GENDER IMPACTS

111. Poverty is a growing problem in Tonga. Tonga is one of the few countries in the
Asia-Pacific region where the incidence of poverty is increasing – with the proportion of
people living below the basic needs poverty line increasing by over one-third between 2001
and 2009 (from 16.2 percent to 22.5 percent). Poverty is concentrated in Tongatapu, and
especially in areas outside Nuku’alofa. While traditional systems of support have typically
provided some protection to poor and vulnerable households, the prolonged and severe
contraction in remittances over recent years have put pressure on these informal risk-sharing
mechanisms.

112. The operation will provide vital grant support to the budget, in a very
challenging fiscal environment. Maintenance of public services is vital to the living
standards of the poor. Budget support will help the Government to maintain the provision of
core services to the public, and to build up its cash balances in order to avoid the impediment
to effective budget execution imposed by cash rationing that have tended to disrupt service
delivery in the past.

113. Reforms supported by the operation will help reduce poverty. Budget execution
will be further strengthened by the PFM reforms supported by the operation, leading to more
effective service provision as resources are utilised as scheduled and as budgeted. Over the
medium- and long-term, improvements in budget transparency and the governance of public
enterprises will improve accountability and efficiency in the use of public resources,
contributing to greater equity of public resource use following recent democratizing reforms.
Improvements in the business license regime are aimed to contribute to faster private sector
development with the potential for additional job creation. Energy sector reforms are expected
to have a substantial impact on poor households over time by improving access to electricity,
reducing the cost of electricity and oil products, and contributing to reduced exposure to
volatility in energy prices. Increased access to electricity is likely to reduce the time and cost
faced by poor households in accessing alternative forms of energy for cooking and lighting.
Lower and more stable energy prices are likely to reduce the share of household incomes
required for energy needs, allowing increased consumption of other basic needs, and reducing
exposure to severe hardship during periods of high imported energy prices.

114. The reforms to strengthen public service wage bill management are not expected
to have an adverse impact on poverty in Tonga. While the reforms can be expected to lead
to a reduction in recruitment in FY2012/13, they will not lead to any lay-offs (reductions in
staff numbers will only be due to attrition). Recruitment will continue for essential personnel,
preserving some new labour market opportunities in the public sector and ensuring that the
provision of core public services will not be interrupted. In addition, the Government’s main
                                               45
rationale for improving its management of the wage bill is to protect non-wage expenditures
from being further squeezed in the flat budget environment, which will also make a
contribution to core service delivery through the availability of the necessary inputs.

115. Measures by the Government to strengthen its revenue effort will not have an
adverse impact on poverty. None of the supported revenue reform measures include
substantial changes in tax rates. The publication of exemptions information in the
Government budget may lead to some reduction in the number of exemptions granted.
Existing exemptions are considered to have a strongly regressive impact, predominantly
benefiting large businesses and wealthier households. Introduction of a presumptive tax for
SMEs will not impact on the effective tax rates for SMEs, as presumptive tax rates will be
deliberately set to achieve consistency between the presumptive and assessed tax regimes.

116. Policy actions supported by the operation are expected to have a positive impact
on women. Business environment reforms supported by this operation are expected to deliver
direct benefits to women. Reforms to the business license regime are expected to address
some of the regulatory constraints cited as barriers to business development by women in
Tonga in a recent IFC study, where accessing business licenses was considered an especially
onerous process. The current burdensome and opaque licensing regime is likely to
disproportionately disadvantage women because women may: i) have less time available to
deal with business license processes because they spend a disproportionate amount of time
engaged in unpaid work within the household; ii) be more likely to suffer from harassment
from regulatory officials; iii) have less exposure to and confidence in dealing with officialdom
and less sophisticated networks for obtaining permits and licenses; and iv) have less access to
information about permits and licenses than their male counterparts13. Budget transparency
reforms will, over the longer-term, build accountability on Government for adequate
resourcing and efficient delivery of social services to improve women’s health and education
outcomes. Tax reforms, improved budget reporting, and implementation of a Treasury Single
Account will improve Government’s ability to mobilize and allocate resources to these
pressing service delivery needs. Improved management of public resources and an improved
business environment will also, over time, contribute to improved economic performance and
an expansion in economic opportunities, with international studies showing that increases in
disposable household income are associated with higher investment in education, especially
for girls. The broader program of Government reforms in the electricity sector is likely to
deliver an expansion in access to electricity and reduced electricity prices. This will reduce
the burden of accessing alternative energy sources for cooking and lighting, which
international experience suggests are often borne disproportionately by women.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
117. The policy actions supported under the operation are not expected to have a
significant impact on Tonga’s environment, natural resources, or forests. The policy
actions supported under the operation aim to strengthen public financial management,
strengthen fiscal policy, and advance structural reform. They do not bear directly on
environmental risks. The natural resource revenue regime may help mitigate some
environmental risks to the extent that it will provide tools to Government to monitor and
regulate some natural resource industries. Over time, the Government’s broader planned
energy sector reforms are likely to lead to a change in energy mix towards renewable
generation. These reforms are also likely to lead to improved safety regulation of private
businesses operating in the petroleum sector, reducing risks of environmental damage through
leaks or spills.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

118. The existing institutional structure for aid management in Tonga will be used to
implement and monitor the policy actions supported by the operation. The MFNP will
provide overall guidance for the budget support program, and will assume overall
responsibility for coordinating the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the
operation. The MFNP will also be ultimately responsible for reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerns government agencies.

119. Specific indicators that the Bank will monitor for each of the policy areas
supported by the proposed operation are set out in Annex 2. The Bank will work with the
Government to assess the progress of implementation of the policy actions supported by the
proposed operation. The Bank will also work with the Government to monitor the specific
indicators associated with each of the policy areas support by the proposed operation. The
Bank will play a coordinating among development partners, to ensure that there is a single,
agreed assessment of the implementation of the policy actions and a single, agreed evaluation
of the monitoring indicators. This will reduce the administrative burden the operation imposes
on the Government.

120. Through its ongoing dialogue with the Government, the Bank will help to sustain
the linkages between the policy actions under the proposed operation and the progress
of the broader reform agenda these support. The Bank and the Government have built up a
strong dialogue on macroeconomic policy issues and public sector and economic reforms,
which both parties are keen to maintain. Through this dialogue, the Bank will continue to
support the Government as it plans further actions to implement is reform program in the
areas of public financial management, fiscal policy, and structural reform. In this way, the
Bank will be in a position to support the consolidation of the policy actions undertaken in the
proposed operation, as well as the implementation of subsequent reform steps in these areas.
The dialogue also will continue to draw on sector expertise within the Bank, and to link sector

                                              47
projects to the Government’s broader public sector and economic reform agenda. In addition,
the Bank will continue to work closely with other development partners, to coordinate support
for the implementation of the Government’s program

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management Environment

121. The 2010 PEFA assessment indicated an improvement in Tonga’s PFM systems
over the three years following the 2007 PEFA assessment. The number of satisfactory
ratings that Tonga received increased from 16 to 20 out of the 27 indicators, and there were
also improvements in the ratings within the satisfactory category. Satisfactory ratings were
received on all indicators and sub-indicator dimensions of the credibility of the budget and on
comprehensiveness and transparency. Within the areas of policy-based budgeting and
predictability and control in budget execution, most ratings and sub-indicator dimensions
were satisfactory, but some unsatisfactory ratings were issued for aspects of the multi-year
perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting, the effectiveness in the
collection of tax payments, competition, value for money and controls in procurement, and
the effectiveness of internal audit. The weaknesses in the multi-year perspective are not
uncommon in thin capacity environments, where the focus is rightly placed on the annual
budget, while the weaknesses noted in the collection of tax payments stemmed from both the
timing of a set of assessment and delays in the collection some large arrears which are before
the courts. The Government has taken steps to address the weaknesses in its procurement
process, with the adoption of new procurement regulations in late 2010.

122. The 2010 PEFA indicated areas of weaknesses in accounting, recording and
reporting and in external scrutiny and audit, which the Government is taking steps to
address. Within the area of accounting, recording and reporting, unsatisfactory ratings were
issued on the availability of information on resources received by service delivery units and
the quality and timeliness of AFS. Making improvements on accounting by service delivery
units is not necessarily a challenge that is suitable for the Government to address immediately,
but the Government has now cleared the backlog in its AFS. More significant weaknesses
were identified in each of the aspects of external scrutiny and audit: the scope, nature and
follow-up of external audit; legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law; and legislative
scrutiny of external audit reports. The proposed operation is supporting the Government’s
efforts to addressing the second area, and it is envisaged that the first and third areas will be
addressed under a possible subsequent operation.

123. Reflecting reform efforts over the recent years, Tonga’s CPIA rating has
increased from 2.9 to 3.5 over the last five years, with Tonga’s policy and institutional
performance now above average for IDA countries. Given these improvements, but
acknowledging the identified weaknesses and reforms still required, the overall fiduciary risk
is rated as “High?. This conclusion is based on the 2010 PEFA’s assessment that the legal and
                                               48
regulatory framework for PFM in Tonga provides a solid basis for budgeting, spending and
accountability, and on the Government’s commitment to continue to implement PFM reforms.

124. Opportunities to gradually reduce the fiduciary risk have been identified and
associated actions have been considered. A number of areas were identified and require
further improvement in order reduce the government’s overall fiduciary risk to the moderate
level. One area for further reform highlighted in the PEFA is accountability and transparency
relating to external audit. Improvements in the coverage of audit reports to include the
Financial Statement of Government as supported by the proposed operation will contribute to
a reduction in this fiduciary risk.


Foreign Exchange Environment

125. In terms of the foreign exchange environment, there is no current IMF
Safeguards Assessment of the NRBT, as Tonga has not accessed IMF funds. A
Safeguards Assessment is likely to be completed prior to the proposed operation going to the
Board. The NRBT publishes its annual report together with the audited accounts and the
report of the independent auditors on those accounts. The FY2009/10 annual report has been
published and the audited financial accounts were unqualified. The NRBT has an established
Revaluation Reserve Account, which provides an additional buffer for any foreign exchange
losses and maintains foreign reserves composed of a basket of currencies reducing the
sensitivity to exchange rate risk as movements of these currencies generally offset each other.

126. There is no indication of substantial issues within the foreign exchange
environment. Until an IMF Safeguards Assessment is concluded, however, there is
insufficient information available to draw any substantiated conclusions, so the foreign
exchange risk must be rated as “High?.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

127. The disbursement measures proposed are to ensure that the grant funds
disbursed by the Bank are deposited in a dedicated account of the NRBT, and then an
amount equivalent to the grant is credited to an account of the government available to
finance budgeted expenditures. The grant will be disbursed according to IDA disbursement
procedures for development policy operations. The full grant amount of US$ 5 million
equivalent will be disbursed against satisfactory completion of the specified policy actions as
listed in Table 3 and the Government agreement as summarised in the letter of the
development policy, and is not tied to any specific purchases. Once the grant is approved by
the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the grant will be deposited by IDA in one
tranche, at the request of the Recipient, into a dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account at
the NRBT.


                                              49
128. Flow of funds (including foreign exchange) is subject to normal Financial
Management processes. It is not possible to track the ultimate use of the foreign exchange
provided by the development policy operation proceeds, but grant proceeds flow into a
dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account at the NRBT and from it to the budget of the
Government, and are thus subject to normal PFM processes and NRBT procedures. By way of
a letter, the Government will provide confirmation to the Bank when the grant amount has
been credited to a Local Currency Deposit Account used to finance budgeted expenditures.

129. The Bank will retain the right to request the auditors of the Government to
conduct a special audit of the dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account established
in the NRBT. The audit will cover the following: (i) the accuracy of the summary of the
transactions of this account, including accuracy of exchange rate conversions; (ii) that this
account was only used for the purposes of the operation and that no other amounts were
deposited into this account, including confirmation from corresponding bank(s) involved in
the funds flow; and (iii) that payments from this dedicated Foreign Currency Deposit Account
were in a timely manner (normally within 30 days of disbursement) transferred to a Local
Currency Deposit Account available to finance budgeted expenditure. The audit will be
provided to the Bank as soon as available, but not later than six months after the last
disbursement from the Association, and will be made publicly available in a timely fashion.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

130. The proposed operation carries three main risks, for which risk mitigation
strategies have been adopted. These risks relate to the thin capacity and small size of the
public sector in Tonga – especially in the context of the current Government restructure –
,Tonga’s extreme vulnerability to external economic conditions and natural disasters, and
political uncertainty following institutional reform. These risks and the associated risk
mitigation strategies are described below.

131. The thin capacity and small size of the public sector in Tonga poses a risk for the
successful implementation of the policy actions supported by the proposed operation.
Tonga experiences the thin capacity typical of public sectors in very small states, with a small
number of public servants called upon to implement the many tasks of a central government.
Limited staff numbers and an absence of staff with some of the required technical
qualifications and experience to undertake supported reforms, particularly in the energy
sector, may mean that the reform program cannot be implemented as successfully or as
quickly as expected. This risk is especially relevant in the context of the current Government
restructure, which is likely to represent a major drain on existing Government capacity over
the first half of FY2012/13 as administrative systems and staff arrangements are revised to
reflect the smaller number of ministries. This risk is being somewhat mitigated by strong
dialogue through which the Government and the Bank have carefully selected a limited
number of policy actions that are key priorities to the Government. The Government and the
Bank have also discussed the implementation requirements for each action at length, to ensure
                                              50
that expectations regarding the timeframes for implementation are realistic. The risk is also
being mitigated through the provision of dedicated technical assistance from various
development partners to the achievement of nearly all specified actions. Technical assistance
support to policy actions supported by this operation is outlined in Appendix 3. Specific risks
arising from disruptions associated with the restructuring are mitigated by the Bank’s
provision of specialist public service reform technical assistance to restructuring efforts within
the Public Service Commission, which should ease the capacity burden associated with
transition.

132. Potential shocks, including natural disasters, a deterioration of global economic
conditions, domestic policy slippages, or a reduction in external assistance, pose risks to
the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. Ongoing macroeconomic stability is
dependent on successful fiscal consolidation, recovery of remittances, and continuing grant
support from donors. The Government remains committed to necessary expenditure and
revenue reforms, but political pressures for further payroll expenditure, in the context of
growing expectations surrounding a planned remuneration review in late 2012, present an
important risk. Remittance flows will be largely determined by economic conditions in the
US, New Zealand and Australia, which are the major sources of remittances. Similarly,
Tonga’s economic outlook remains heavily dependent on the timely provision of budget
support grants from development partners. A shortfall or substantial delay in the provision of
budget support would undermine cash management and disrupt service delivery.
Macroeconomic disruption arising under several feasible scenarios would distract available
capacity and resources from implementation of actions supported by the program, as well as
undermining the impact of these actions on growth and poverty-reduction. Tonga also remains
vulnerable to natural disasters, which could have severe impacts on growth and revenue, or
exacerbate existing expenditure pressures, as well as diverting scarce Government
administrative capacity towards emergency operations. Risks associated with these various
external vulnerabilities are being mitigated through: i) the conservative tax revenue forecasts
adopted by the MFNP for FY2012/13, which are consistent with IMF projections; ii)
development partners contributing critical resources to support the budget in challenging
fiscal circumstances, allowing the accumulation of cash reserves to manage shocks over the
medium-term; and iii) the Bank’s dialogue with Government on appropriate ways to approach
and manage expenditure or revenue shocks and pressures.

133.    Tonga’s political system has been recently reformed and is subject to uncertainty.
While Government has remained stable over the length of the current term, political dynamics
within the new system remain a source of potential uncertainty. There have been two
reshuffles of key Ministerial positions leading to the appointment of new Ministers of
Finance. Further changes in the composition of key Ministerial posts could present challenges
to the momentum of progress with specified actions. Broader political changes remain a
possibility in the current challenging economic environment, and represent a source of
substantial uncertainty, given the recent reform of political institutions. Risks associated with

                                               51
various political uncertainties are being mitigated through the Bank’s dialogue with a range of
Ministers and officials on macroeconomic policy issues, which has helped strengthen support
around planned reforms across a broad cross-section of Government.

134. Ensuring ongoing coordination between development partners remains a priority
for mitigating identified risks. Strong coordination between donors has assisted in
mitigating risks to date through: i) ensuring consistency in dialogue regarding economic and
public finance issues; ii) supporting the mobilization of required technical assistance at
appropriate times; and iii) achieving consistency and complementarities across elements of
the reform agenda supported by various donors. Maintaining this level of coordination is vital
for the mitigation of identified risks and continued progress with reform actions, and will
require the continuing dedication of adequate Bank staff time.

     IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
                                Tonga


 On May 16 , 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga. 1

 Background

 Tonga's economy is recovering gradually from the effects of the global slowdown and
 the domes t ic credit crunch , thanks to the pickup in construction activity and rebound in
 tourism. H owever, private consumption has been anem ic due to the decline in
 remittance inflows. In add ition , banks' lending standards have remained tight,
 constraining p rivate consumption and investment. R eal GOP growth is forecast to be
 around 1 Y2 percent in F Y20 11 / 12 , led by stronger t ourism activ ity and a continued fiscal
 sti mulus funded by donor aid and previously cont racted concessional loans.

 CPI inflation declined to 2% percent y/y in February 201 2 , reflecting main ly stabilization
 in fuel and food prices as well as exchange rate appreciation. Inflation is likely to
 average around 4 % percent in FY2011/ 12.

 The fiscal pos ition has strengthened but vulnerabilities remain . Generous grant inflows
 from donors contributed to narrowing the fiscal deficit to an estimated 2% percent of
 GOP in 2011 / 12 (from abou t 6 percent o f GOP in FY201 0/11 ) . Capita l expenditure is

   Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement , the IMF holds bilateral discussions w ith
 members, usually every year. A staff team vis its the country, collects economic and financ ial
 information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
 On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
 by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
 Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors , and this summary is
 transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanat ion of any qualifiers used in summings
 up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/ np/sec/misc/gualifiers.htm.

expected to be lower by 2 percentage points of GOP due to the completion of the
reconstruction of the central business district and near completion of the road projects
using the China EXIM Bank loans. Nevertheless, Tonga remains at a "high risk of
external debt distress" according to th is year's World Bank-IMF debt sustainability
analysis.

Buoyant official development assistance helped improve the balance of payment
position , which allowed the Nationa l Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) to let the currency
appreciate by 6 percent against the US$ and real effective terms in 2011 to help curb
inflation pressures stemming from rising fuel and food import prices. The level of
reserves increased to around $130 million as of end-2011 , covering more than 6 months
of imports of goods and services.

Monetary conditions have remained accommodative over the past two years, but with
no signs of a pickup in private credit. Monetary policy has been appropriately geared
toward encouraging bank lending. The banking system is adequately capitalized and
profitable but credit costs re lated to the rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) following
the 2004-08 credit bubble remain high; and banks have continued to restrain credit
amidst an uncertain outlook.


Executive Board Assessment

Directors welcomed Tonga's recovery from the global crisis but noted remaining
vulnerabilities and a high debt burden . With downside risks clouding the outlook,
Directors emphasized the importance of strengthening policy buffers and the foundation
for faster and more inclusive growth.

Directors concurred that fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild the government's cash
balances and safeguard debt sustainability. Accordingly, containing the public sector's
wage bill, prioritizing expend itures, and broadening the tax base remain top policy
priorities for the period ahead . More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to
implement their fiscal plans w ithin a medium-term framework and further improve the
quality of public spending to meet Tonga's development objectives.

Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy stance appropriate in
light of the banks' cautious approach to lending. Taking note of the staffs assessment
that the exchange rate is broad ly in line with fundamentals, Directors agreed that, going
forward, the exchange rate cou ld absorb the bulk of external shocks with official
intervention limited to smoothing operations.

Directors supported steps underway to reduce credit risk and strengthen financial
intermediation. They welcomed recent legislation to improve the registration of collateral
and recommended further financial sector reforms such as establishing a centralized
credit bureau, facilitating land leases, and enacting a bankruptcy law. Directors also
urged the authorities to continue to resist pressure to administer bank lending rates.




                                                 60
Directors underscored the importance of removing structural hurdles to private
investment and reducing the cost of doing business, including through public enterprise
reforms. Steps in this direction would lay the groundwork for broaden ing the production
base and reducing poverty.
