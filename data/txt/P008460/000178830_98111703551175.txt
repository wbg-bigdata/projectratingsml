HUNGARY
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
CONSERVATION COMPONENT (LOAN 3055-HU)
PREFACE
The Energy Development and Conservation Project in Hungary comprises two loans,
one to the Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) fo the amount of US$ 100 million
(Loan 3056-HU) and one to the National Bank of Hungary for the amount of US$10 million
(Loan 3055-HU). Both loans were guaranteed by the Hungarian People's Republic. This
report is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for Loan 3055-HU.
The major objective of Loan 3055-HU was the preparation of an updated energy
conservation program and financing of related investments (US$10 million equivalent) in
energy conservation subprojects through participating commercial banks to supplement
existing lines of credit for this purpose.
Loan 3055-HU was closed on December 31, 1995, as scheduled at the time of
appraisal. From the original amount of US$10 million, only US$1.644 million was disbursed.
The reason for this small disbursement was the availability of funds at considerably lower
interest rates financed by the "Coal Aid" bilateral arrangement with West Germany. This
arrangement was established after Loan 3055-HU became effective.
The ICR was prepared in 1996 by David Caplin and Tamas Huber (Econoconsult),
following a mission in March 1996. The responsible department decided at that time to wait
until the ICR was prepared for Loan 3056-HU and issue the two ICRs in the same package. In
the meantime, the Operations Evaluation Department prepared a Performance Audit Report
(June 24, 1997) covering Loan 3055-HU as well as the two previous energy conservation
loans for Hungary (Loan 2317-HU and Loan 2709-HU).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HUNGARY
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
CONSERVATION COMPONENT (LOAN 3055-HU)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.   The Energy Development and Conservation Project in Hungary comprises two
loans, one to the Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) for the amount of
US$100 million (Loan 3056-HU) and one to the National Bank of Hungary for the
amount of US$10 million (Loan 3055-HU).  Both loans were guaranteed by the
Hungarian Peoples Republic. This report is the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) for Loan 3055-HU. The Project was a component of the Energy Development and
Conservation Project which had three main objectives, which were to support:
(a)  significant improvements in the policy and institutional framework of the energy
sector including appropriate pricing coupled with subsidy elimination, restructuring of
the coal mining sector and improved power sector investment planning;
(b)  development of the oil and gas sector through the gradual restructuring of the
national oil and gas company (OKGT), and the opening of the sector to foreign
investment and the financing of high priority investments; and
(c)  the preparation of an updated energy conservation program and financing of related
investments (US$ 10 million equivalent) in energy conservation subprojects through
participating commercial banks to supplement existing lines of credit for this purpose.
2.   At the time of Project preparation, the objectives were clear and achievable. They
also conformed to Government priorities for the energy sector as regards pricing,
restructuring and energy conservation. This component was in fact the third in a series of
loans for energy conservation in Hungary. It was prepared after the first project (Loan
2317-RU, in 1983) had proved outstandingly successful, and the second project (Loan
2709-HU, in 1986) was proceeding well. At the time of appraisal, all participants in the
ongoing lines of credit had confirmed the existence of continued strong credit demand, in
spite of the fact that the Government had removed with effect from January 1, 1988 the
specific tax incentives for energy conservation. A survey of potential users of the
proposed credit line extension was carried out in November 1988 and confirmed that
there was already a partial list of 52 potential investment subprojects, with a total cost of
about US$100 million and a foreign exchange content of US$49 million. Applications
had already been presented to commercial banks for the financing of some 15
subprojects, with a foreign exchange content of US$11 million. It was estimated that the



2
combined subprojects financed by the credit line would lead to energy savings of 5,540
tons of oil equivalent (Toe). The institutional arrangements in force had already proved
satisfactory for implementing the earlier projects, and no difficulties were foreseen in the
full utilization of this new supplement to the line of credit. It was acknowledged that,
since this was a line of credit, the ERR could not be precisely determined in advance; the
eligibility criteria were designed to give a minimum ERR of 18%, and a sample of
previous projects showed ERRs in the 25%-35% range. However, changes were already
occurring before the start of the implementation period relating to the competitiveness of
World Bankfunds which would materially affect the utilization of the credit line.
B. Achievement of Objectives
3.   The objectives of the project were amply achieved, since more than 200 energy
conservation subprojects were implemented, with a total energy saving of 0.8 petajoules
(18,750 toe). However the vast majority of these subprojects were not financed through
the Bank line of credit, but were financed by the "Coal Aid" bilateral arrangement with
West Germany which provided funds at considerably lower interest rates, as well as by
funds made available by EU Phare. As a consequence, only seven subprojects were
financed by the Bank loan. They are:
(1) Tisza Petroleum Industrial Company
Development of Energy Supply System (waste heat recovery)
(2) Qualital Light Metal Foundry
Modernisation of Electrical Soaking Furnaces (installation of more energy
efficient furnaces)
(3) Danube Refilnery
Frequency Changing Speed Control of Motors (installation of frequency
modulators on motors in pumps and compressors)
(4) Pannonglas Industrial Company
Modernisation of Compressed Air Supply (piston compressors replaced by more
energy-efficient screw compressors)
(5) Ipoly District Woodworking Company
Utilisation of Wood-waste for Energy Supply (installation of an appliance to burn
wood chips - waste product from the furniture factory)
(6) Porcio Limited Liability Company
Geothermal Energy Utilization (installation of small equipment items and
refurbishment of the thermal water system)
(7) Porcio Limited Liability Company
Geothermal Energy Utilization (geothermal supply network for the town of
Szarvas).

4.   The ERRs of the individual subprojects in this series of credit lines have always
been calculated using the actual local prices of energy carriers, net of taxes and subsidies.
This method has been used because of the difficulty at any one time in determining for
the relevant reference energy streams whether Hungary was a net importer or exporter.
Energy prices were increased over the period 1990-1995 by two- to four-times, and in
some cases have approached international price levels. However, the prices of natural
gas and electricity reached economic recovery levels in January 1997. Since five of the
subprojects achieved savings in electricity or natural gas utilization, the planned and
actual economic benefits attributed to these subprojects are therefore still underestimated
in the economic analyses.
5.   In the subproject implemented by the Ipoly District Woodworking Company, the
fuel oil buming facility was replaced by one utilizing wood chips which are a waste
product from the furniture factory. This equipment is not now being operated and the
project therefore has an unsatisfactory rate of return.  All the other subprojects
demonstrate healthy ERRs ranging from 27% - 97%. Only in one project (Waste heat
recovery at the Tisza Petroleum Industrial Company) can the savings be realistically
evaluated in terms of fuel oil. Using the local price of fuel oil, this project reported an
ERR of 45.9% against a planned figure of 32.5%. If the international price of light fuiel
oil were to be used as the economic value of the energy saved, the ERR would rise to
108.5%. Table 6, A gives detailed technical and economic information on each of the
seven subprojects.
Environmental Impacts
6.   Virtually every investment project resulting in a reduction in energy consumption
may be regarded as having a positive environmental impact, since there will be a



4
reduction in the environmental pollution attributable to the production of that energy now
foregone. The environmetal benefits are most vividly demonstrated by the impacts on air
quality using specific emission values, determined from the savings in the production of
individual energy carriers on the basis of empirical data (as measured by the weight of
emissions in kg. per GJ of energy saved). The following table shows the reduction in air
pollution attributable to the seven projects implemented.

C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
7.   Although some 200 energy conservation projects were carried out in the period
considered, the vast majority of these subprojects were not financed through the Bank
line of credit. There were three reasons that 84% of the Bank credit line remained unused
(1) The "Coal Aid" bilateral arrangement with West Germany from 1991 onwards
has provided funds at much more attractive interest rates than the Bank loan
onlending rates, and World Bank funds became essentially uncompetitive after
1991. The same applied for EU Phare funds. An advertising campaign which
aimed at popularizing the use of the Bank line of credit, and which was sponsored
by the National Bank of Hungary failed in attracting new business.
(2) Until around 1991, the use of the Bank line of credit was the only way in
which companies could obtain hard currency for the procurement of energy
saving technology. Subsequently, firms became able to exchange HUF for hard
currency for such purchases, the attractiveness of the Bank line of credit
diminished.
(3) It had become somewhat harder to identify good energy conservation projects,
since the earlier loans had supported the obvious candidates, although it must be
said that most of the projects which were eventually selected for this line of credit
had excellent ERRs.
D. Project sustainability
8.   Two of the companies (Qualital Light Metal Foundry and Ipoly District
Woodworking Company) are now in financial trouble and are likely to be privatized.
The equipment installed in both of these finns is essentially cost reducing, and can be



5
expected to operate after privatization. For all the other subprojects, the companies
wherein the conservation equipment have been installed are economically sound and can
be expected to operate for may years to come. The sustainability of these subprojects is
not in doubt, since it is very unlikely that energy carrier prices will decline in the future in
real terms.
9.   A new factor which could affect the sustainability of  energy conservation
programs in Hungary is the new organizational and institutional arrangement which has
just been initiated for the Institute for State Energetics and Energy Supervision (AEEF).
The AEEF has been reconstituted and is now non-profit company, renamed The Energy
Information Agency. The main activities planned for the new Agency will be in the
fields of energy statistics and energy management, energy demand forecasting and data
collection in the field of district heating. While it also plans to continue to work on the
management and technical assessment of projects supported by loans from international
bodies, its contract for cooperation with the National Bank of Hungary will terminate this
year, and possible future arrangements for cooperation between the two organizations
have not yet been discussed.
E. Bank Performance
10. Extremely good working relationships had been established during the previous
Bank supported energy conservation projects between Bank staff and the personnel of all
the Borrower's institutions involved, including the National Bank of Hungary (NBH), the
Hungarian Credit Bank, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and, in particular, the AEEF,
which identified and designed the subprojects for the beneficiaries, supervised the
implementation and carried out, in cooperation with NBH, the technical, economic and
financial evaluations of the subprojects' outcomes. Bank staff on supervision missions,
only needed to check samples of the appraisals of individual subprojects, in order to
ensure that the rules were being followed, for e.g., eligibility criteria and subproject
appraisal, as laid down in the previous lines of credit.
F. Borrower Performance
11. All Hungarian agencies involved with the Project have performed in an exemplary
fashion. However, it remains to be seen whether the new organisational set-up and role,
which have just been introduced for AEEF (paragraph 9), will be appropriate, and
whether the energy conservation operations, now envisaged to be carried out by
organisations in the private sector,  will prove to be executed as efficiently and
economically as AEEF was able to do in the past.



6
G. Assessment of Outcome
12. There is a dilemma concerning the assessment of the project's outcome in the
conventional terms required for an ICR. Of the seven subprojects actually implemented,
five have technical and economic outcomes which are highly satisfactory. Although less
than 15% of the loan was disbursed, competing sources of finance provided funds for
energy conservation far in excess of the amount which was being made available under
the Bank loan. Given the small demand for the funds available under the loan, it would
have been better to cancel the uncommitted balance before the scheduled closing date.
On balance, the project should be rated as marginally satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
13.  Since the equipment installed will now be used in the future operations of the
companies concerned, most of which will find a home in the private sector, a future role
of the Hungarian Government or the Bank should not be necessary.
1. Key Lessons Learned
14.  That high economic rates of return can still be obtained from small energy
conservation rehabilitation projects (as characterised by the eligibility criteria adopted by
the Hungarian authorities) has again been proved in this project. This is not the first time
that there has been a low utilisation of the Bank loan on an energy conservation project
(see, e.g., the Portugal Energy Conservation Project), because of the uncompetitive nature
of the interest rates levied on the Bank loan. It is recommended that in future energy
conservation operations, this possibility is closely assessed before making new
commitments.

Preface
The Energy Development and Conservation Project in Hungary comprises two loans, one
to the Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) for the amount of US$100 million (Loan
3056-HU) and one to the National Bank of Hungary for the amount of US$10 million (Loan
3055-HU). Both loans were guaranteed by the Hungarian People's Republic. This report is the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for Loan 3056-HU.
The major objective of Loan 3056-HU was to continue the assistance provided to the
Government of Hungary under the first Petroleum Project (Loan 2398-HU) i.e. to slow down the
decline in domestic oil and gas production. Further objectives of the loan were to support
reforms in the institutional framework of the energy sector including appropriate pricing and
elimination of subsidies, the opening up of this sector to foreign investments and the
reorganization of the national oil and gas company.
Loan 3056-HU was closed on December 31,1997, two years beyond the original closing
date. The last disbursement took place on January 16,1998. EBRD co-financed the project for an
amount of US$55.0 million. From the original amount of US$100.00 million, US$ 93.68 million
was disbursed. By April 15, 1998 the Borrower had repaid US$ 34.1 million.
The two-year completion delay was due mainly to: (i) the reorganization of the Borrower
and implementing agency (OKGT), from an integrated state oil and gas producing and
distribution company into the Hungarian Oil and Gas Company (MOL Rt), a joint-stock core
company with separate operating and service subsidiaries, which has since been privatized; and
(ii) the late start of two subprojects.
The ICR was prepared by Marc Heitner Principal Energy Specialist, Anton Smit,
(petroleum exploration and production consultant) and N.C. Krishnamurthy, (industrial
consultant) under the supervision of Henk Busz, Energy Sector Leader, Europe and Central Asia
Region.
Preparation of this ICR was based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement and
additional agreement thereto, supervision reports, a visit to Hungary in April 1998 and
completion reports prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) and the borrower (MOL
Rt). The Bank's draft ICR was circulated to NBH, MIT and MOL on June 5, 1998.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1. The project had the following sector objectives:
a) improve the policy and institutional framework of the energy sector;
b) restructure the national oil and gas company; and
c) open the oil and gas sector to foreign investments.
2.  The Loan provided for the financing of:
a) oil and gas field development, upgrading and enhanced recovery;
b) construction of underground storage for gas;
c) pipeline expansion and modernization;
d) exploration and production equipment;
e) training and technical assistance in oil and gas operations, exploration including field and
basin studies, data storage, geothermal developments, management information systems
as well as contract preparation, exploration promotion, export of petroleum services and
expertise and institutional strategy and development.
3.    Subsequently downstream subprojects were added including:
a) modernization of product loading systems;
b) conversion of part of the existing storage capacity into national safety storage; and
c) installation of a new communication system.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    In general, pricing objectives in the energy sector were achieved although not within the
time that was set at appraisal. The exceptions are the wellhead price for locally produced gas,
which is still priced below its economic cost, and the price of coal which is supported by
artificially high tariffs at coal-fired power plants.



iii
5.    Institutional objectives have been achieved resulting in the transformation of the state
owned National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) into a private company (MOL Rt), together with a
significant downsizing and streamlining of the company. MOL Rt has started to operate as an
international oil company. The company has reached a solid financial standing which enables it to
mobilize resources on the international capital markets. As a result of the introduction of a new
Mining Law, four foreign companies are now holding exploration rights in the country.
6.    Operational objectives have been successfully reached and the physical components are
all performing as expected at appraisal. Early in the project cycle, implementation was delayed by
the changes in the country's political system and the restructuring and corporatization of the
implementing agency into a structure in line with international oil companies. Due to this slow
start the project closing date was delayed by two years.
7.    Consultancies, studies and training have been used very well by MOL. Application of
new concepts in exploration and production have contributed to a significant increase in
efficiency.
S.    The project can be rated as highly satisfactory.

ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (LOAN 3056-HU)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
a. Sectoral
1.    At the time the loan was made, Hungary was still a centrally-planned economy. Except
for transportation fuels, energy prices were considerably below economic levels. The Government
had by then recognized that the levels of energy utilization, particularly in industry were
unsustainable. The Bank agreed with this prognosis and made it an objective under the loan to
increase energy prices (including those for oil and gas, coal, power and district heating) to
economic levels. This also implied the cessation of energy subsidies (particularly to households),
the introduction of seasonal prices for natural gas, and adjustments to the power tariffs. To
support the implementation of the price adjustments, an understanding was reached during
negotiations on a phased increase of energy prices such that, by 1993, energy subsidies would
cease altogether. Furthermore, an agreement had been reached on a set of studies, to be carried
out by the concerned Hungarian entities largely with the aim of establishing economic price
levels.
b. Institutional
2.    Historically, the Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) had been responsible for
all activities in the oil and gas sector, and, unlike multinational oil companies, was involved not
only in petroleum services (geophysical works, drilling, logging) but also in engineering and
construction. OKGT, which had little autonomy, was organized into 23 companies along
geographic and functional lines; however there was overlap and duplication among the
companies, some related functions (such as exploration and production) were seemingly
uncoordinated and the organization was characterized as "inflexible". By Loan negotiations, a
certain amount of reorganization had taken place, and understandings had been reached with
OKGT under which it would focus on its core activities (those of an integrated oil company) and
operate at arm's length with the non-core businesses (gas distribution and manufacturing).
Furthermnore, in due course, it would be corporatized. The Bank also encouraged OKGT and the
Government to open exploration acreage in Hungary to foreign oil companies -- this involved
changes in the legislation and the fiscal regime.



-2 -
c. Financial
3.    OKGT largely acted as a fiscal agent of the Government, and its accounting was designed
for tax and other compliance purposes. Its accounts were consolidated incompletely ' and its
management information systems were found lacking. The overall financial condition of OKGT
was found satisfactory, but to ensure that it would be able to fund its investment programs in
future years, the Bank and OKGT agreed on a 15% rate of return on assets covenant. This was
appropriate at the time given that all prices were set by the Government.
d. Operational
4.    The project mainly supported a time slice of OKGT's activities in gas and oil production,
transportation and underground storage. Such support had already been given successfully under
the preceding Petroleum Project (2398-HU), with the aim of arresting the decline in production
from partly depleted fields. At appraisal fourteen subprojects for oil and gas production were
analyzed and provisionally accepted with the understanding that more extended studies on several
of these would have to be done and that during implementation modifications could become
necessary.
5.    For underground gas storage the aim was to increase the existing capacity by 690 MCM to
2,540 MCM, which capacity was then expected to be sufficient until the year 2000. Seven
subprojects addressed existing gas transmission constraints by the construction of new gas
pipelines, compressor stations, expanded odorization facilities (for detection of leaks) and
improved telemetering and telecommunications (for better measurement accuracy, optimizing of
throughput and faster bill collection). In 1994 three new subprojects consistent with the Project's
scope and objectives were added. These were: (i) improved product loading; (ii) safety storage of
crude oil and products; and (iii) the modernization of communications.
e. Technical Assistance and Training
6.    Consultants Studies were included for a number of subjects, among which assistance to
OKGT in the improvement its operations, modernization of data management systems and
finding export markets for OKGT's own expertise (table 7). Training was, as under the first
project, directed at familiarizing OKGT with technical, institutional and financial concepts
employed by western oil companies.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
a. Sectoral
7.    The pricing objectives under the Project have on the whole been achieved, although not
always within the time frame agreed to when the Loan was made (table 13 shows a comparison
between the targets and actual results). Regarding oil products, prices were liberalized in 1991,
and are now above economic costs. With respect to natural gas and electric power, the
Government introduced a regulatory framework enabling companies to earn an 8% return on
proportional equity since January 1, 1997. Under this framework, the price of gas at the well

head is cost based,' so that it is below the opportunity cost (i.e. the cost of imported gas or that of
fuel oil equivalent). Furthermore, the structure of both the gas and electricity tariffs is sub-
optimal, with industry subsidizing households.2 Regarding coal, a remarkable downsizing
program has taken place; however the remaining coal mines have by and large been integrated
with power plants and benefit from a higher power purchase price to the grid, which is
considerably in excess of the economic cost of supply. These contracts will lapse over the period
2000-2004, and they are not expected to be extended.
b. Institutional
8.    The institutional objectives of the Project have largely been achieved: (i) OKGT was
converted into MOL Rt, and incorporated in 1991; (ii) non-core activities,3 including gas
distribution were disposed of (and subsequently largely privatized); (iii) successive
reorganizations have resulted in a streamlining of the company and the creation of profit centers;
(iv) staff level has been reduced to 14,000 (from 22,000 in 1991), with an increasing proportion
of professionals; and (v) modem management information systems, making use of the latest
computerized tools, have been introduced. Furthermore, in 1995 the Government initiated the
privatization of MOL, so that by March 1998, it was left with 25% of MOL's stock (plus a
golden share giving it veto rights over certain decisions). The privatization process of MOL
alone has provided the Government so far with US$800 million (and the value of remaining stock
exceeds US$700 million). MOL has also started to explore abroad, and presently holds
petroleum rights in eight countries. The framework for exploration was also considerably
changed thanks to a Mining Law introduced in.1993. MOL's exploration acreage in Hungary has
been reduced from the whole country to 15,000 sq. km (or 16% of the land area).4 At the same
time, four foreign groups hold 8,300 sq. km as of end 1997 -- they have made no discovery so far.
In all, MOL has been transformed in a relatively short period into a small international oil
company operating along commercial lines.
c. Financial
9.    The financial performance of OKGT has been broadly satisfactory. OKGT complied with
the financial covenants over 1988-92 (a comparison of the appraisal forecast and the results
appears in tables 10,11 and 12). Following corporatization into MOL in 1991, and the ensuing
revaluation of assets, MOL was not able to comply with the rate of return on assets covenant,
largely on account of the deregulation of oil prices and the perpetuation of abnormally low prices
for domestic natural gas. Given that the Government introduced a regulatory framework for
This policy does not promote investments in exploration given that the return of 8% is incommensurate with
the assumed risk.
2   MOL points out that it was not the lack of intention that prevented gas prices from being raised sufficiently, but
that larger increases would not have been socially acceptable (see Appendix 2).
3   Except for geophysical services and drilling which are carried out by subsidiaries of MOL. One should note
that a drilling company was spun off from MOL and has recently been privatized.
4   Under a 1997 amendment of the Mining Act, unlike foreign oil companies, MOL can access exploration
acreage without prior bidding.

natural gas in 1997, and that MOL is now exposed to the price risks of the petroleum markets, the
Bank, at MOL's request, has recently agreed to waive the rate of return covenant.
10.   The financial standing of MOL can best be perceived by its access to the financial
markets. Its share price has increased from US$7.50 to US$30 over the past two years.
Furthermore, MOL was recently able to mobilize US$500 million on advantageous terms (Libor
plus 20 bp, 7 years) which was used in part to refinance US$365 million in various borrowings.
Thus, MOL, which does not have a credit rating, is perceived as a sound corporate borrower by
the international financial community.
d. Operational
11.   While the project initially provided for the development of fourteen subprojects for oil and
gas development, seven of these were subsequently dropped since they turned out to be
uneconomic or were financed by MOL from other funds. Moreover financing for a major
subproject, Szeghalom, was significantly reduced when it became apparent that the deeper
reserves of oil could not be economically produced. The overall financing for oil and gas
development was thus reduced from US$79.7 million to US$14.9 million. Table 14 gives a
comparison of the volumes and ERR's estimated at appraisal and those presently expected to be
recovered until the end of the economic life of the fields. This total production matches well with
the total volume predicted at appraisal. The presently calculated ultimate rate of return of the
seven subprojects combined is 54%.
12.   Adding capacity for underground gas storage was started and completed on schedule, but,
for a third storage facility, the start was delayed pending the outcome of a further study on its
optimal location. This new facility, at Zsana, has now been completed successfully. Of the seven
gas transmission subprojects two were withdrawn and completed by MOL from its own
resources. The remainder were completed according to plan. Three subprojects were added later
involving product loading, safety storage and the modernization of the communication system at
MOL's headquarters; they were completed within the extended duration of the project.
13.   At appraisal, rates of return were calculated as follows: (i) for the three underground
subprojects, the revenues were calculated on the basis of avoided costs of fuel oil imports,
without the storage, as a proxy to the storage margins to be charged as a differential between
sunmmer and winter gas prices; and (ii) for the two pipeline subprojects, rates of return were
calculated over a range of assumed incremental transport levies to be included in the gas price
such as would result in acceptable rate of return. The forecast rates of return after completion
have been calculated on the basis of a return of 8% on proportional equity, after costs, for all its
gas, in line with the current regulatory framework. Gas operations assets, however, were last
revalued in 1991, and the base year for valuing assets, for regulatory purposes, is 1995, even
though there has been substantial inflation since then and new investments were made. While
exploration/production, and pipeline transport have been allocated a return chargeable in the gas
price, margins were allowed for gas storage since 1997 only, as a residual to the remaining
portion of the overall gas operations return. The allowed margin for storage, in effect until 2001
and adjusted only for inflation only, is unsatisfactory. MOL expects to be able to charge from the
year 2002 on, storage margins equivalent to US$40 per thousand cubic meters of storage
capacity, in line with EU practices. If this revision is not allowed and the current rate regime
continues, all of the storage subprojects would have negative rates of return. MOL is aware of



this problem and has requested a rate review from the authorities. The authorized incremental
tariffs on the two pipeline subprojects yield adequate returns (table 14).
14.   During the project, environmental requirements in Hungary became much more stringent
and, since 1990, MOL has invested approximately HUT 26 billion to comply with these new
standards and made a provision of HUF 19.3 billion for environmental liabilities. For many
products the Hungarian requirements are even stricter than those issued by the EU. All Bank
subprojects have met the environmental standards for field engineering and, during their
implementation, there were no complaints about adverse impacts. Before construction of the last
of the field projects, the underground gas storage at Zsana, an Environmental Impact Study (EIS)
was carried out. The conclusions of this study were approved by the Bank. MOL is still working
on a reduction of the sulfur content in its domestically-produced gas, which is at some locations
above the EU standard of 5.0 mg/m3. There have been no serious industrial accidents in
connection with the execution of the project.
e. Technical Assistance and Training
15.   Training and studies (table 7) have appreciably contributed to the downsizing of the
company by familiarizing staff with automation, and enhancing the efficiency of MOL to a
considerable degree. During the last five years staff employment has, as a result of the training,
gradually shifted away from lower educated categories. Technical training concentrated on the
application of foreign technology in exploration, production and reservoir engineering is now in
regular use by MOL. An good example of training in combination with technical assistance is the
application of horizontal drilling; some thirty horizontal wells have yielded impressive results.
16.   Another example is the use of modern 3D seismic recording followed by computer
assisted interpretation. Much improved seismic definition now permits an early rejection of
clearly uneconomic prospects and the efficient testing of the promising prospects with fewer
wells, thus reducing exploration costs significantly. Finding costs of new reserves decreased from
US$5.9/bbl of oil equivalent in 1986 to US$2.6/bbl at present (in current prices).
17.  In conformity with international oil practices, MOL recalculated at end 1993 its reserves
on the basis of economic recoverability, rather than technical recoverability, as was the practice
under the centrally planned economy. This resulted in a reduction by about 40% of its oil reserves
and 50% of its gas reserves. Following this revision, MOL's yearly gas production represents
10% of its economic reserves, a much more acceptable figure than the mere 5% from the
postulated reserves before the revision.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
18.   Project implementation coincided with the transformation of Hungary into a market
economy. This created a favorable environment, particularly for the abolition of most price
controls and the introduction of regulatory frameworks broadly consistent with modern practice.
The political climate also supported the privatization of MOL, which was carried out in a
transparent fashion.  MOL is at present responsive to market signals, and operates on a
commercial basis.
19.   The savings under the initial subprojects were earmarked to fund additional ones, which
were compatible with the Project's objectives. The identification of such subprojects took time,



- 6 -
particularly because this coincided with the restructuration and privatization of MOL, and
resulting changes in senior management. As a result disbursements were delayed, and thus
slower than anticipated at appraisal (table 4).'
D. Project Sustainability
20.   The sectoral, institutional and financial objectives of the Project have, on the whole, been
achieved. At this juncture, Hungary is negotiating its entry into the European Union. This
implies, inter alia, a competitive energy market, in which prices are determined by market forces,
and where foreign competitors to MOL are allowed unhindered access. The authorities are aware
that this will require amendments to the prevailing legislation,2 which will open further MOL's
protected market to competition. MOL benefits at present from low-cost domestic gas production
and domestic refineries (which give it a home advantage vs. imported products, which are costlier
to transport). Nevertheless, with the integration into the EU, the market should become more
competitive, particularly since the size of the Hungarian oil market has been stagnant in recent
years.3 This competitive environment will ensure the sustainability of the Project in the coming
years.
21.   Although presently the subprojects for the production of oil and gas are performing well,
(some 34% of the present domestic production comes from the Bank's supported fields), it is
unavoidable that most of these fields will reach the end of their economic life in 10-15 years. The
yearly production from all of MOL's producing fields (5.6 million tons) is only partly offset by
the discoveries of new deposits by exploration; these average some 2.0 million tons per year.
However these new discoveries are likely to be located in progressively smaller fields and these,
notwithstanding innovations like horizontal drilling, will be increasingly more expensive to
produce. It must thus be anticipated that, by 2010, MOL's production will have declined to just
above 1.0 million ton per year, or about 20% of today's production. The conclusion is that
domestic production will only be economically sustainable over a limited period. MOL realizes
that a future major reorientation of the company will become unavoidable '. The downstream
investments in gas pipelines and gas storage are critical to the gas sector because of the growing
share of natural gas in Hungary's energy mix. These investments are highly sustainable, subject
to suitable adjustments to the gas tariffs (para. 13).
E. Bank Performance
22.   With respect to sectoral and institutional policies the conditionality focused on major
deficiencies in the energy sector including commercialization, institutional set-up and legal
framework, and pricing,. Supervision missions (table 16) assisted the authorities in key areas
An amount of US$741,195 in the loan was canceled due to misprocurement.
In particular, the present framework for natural gas transport and trading, for all practical purposes, restricts
third party entry. Similarly, MOL is given preferential treatment in accessing exploration acreage.
3   The gas market bottomed out in 1992, and until 1997, increased by a remarkable 5.7% per annum. The gas
market however is very sensitive to climate conditions.
4   MOL has started diversifying its upstream interests by acquiring exploration concessions in several promising
intemational areas.

such as the corporatization of OKGT, the passage of legislation enabling oil exploration by
foreign oil companies, the concentration of MOL activities into core areas and its initiation of
foreign exploration and production. In all the above areas, MOL was particularly successful.
With respect to the financial and pricing aspects, the Project was well appraised, but there might
not have been sufficient follow up so that the pricing objectives under the Loan are only on the
way to being achieved.' Also, the Bank recognized early that the rate of return on assets covenant
was no longer relevant, but failed to waive it,2 causing some difficulties to the Government and
MOL during the privatization process. The Bank was able to keep the technical staff on the
missions nearly unchanged resulting in consistency in recommendations to the Borrower and an
efficient execution of the physical components of the project (table 16).
F. Performance of the Government and MOL
23.   With respect to the sectoral and institutional framework, Hungary's performance was
impressive, having achieved at a remarkable pace a transition from a planned to a market
economy. The introduction of legal and regulatory frameworks for petroleum exploration and
development, as well as for natural gas and electricity, together with the privatization of MOL (as
well as the gas distribution companies) demonstrate the turnaround. It is unfortunate that the
pricing objectives have only been attained with some delays and incompletely. However, the
considerable interest by foreign investors indicate that this aspect did not constitute a significant
barrier to privatization given the otherwise favorable prospects of the Hungarian energy market.
24.   The performance of MOL has been remarkable as it was able to absorb in a relatively
short period the methods and tools used by the oil industry internationally, and implement these
successfully. This can best be exemplified by its foreign ventures (MOL made a discovery in
Tunisia), in domestic exploration and production (where the cost of finding oil has declined
dramatically), and in the adaptation of its facilities to competition, while at the same time
upgrading its plants to meet stricter environmental standards. The results of all these efforts
appear ultimately in MOL's earnings which have increased steadily since privatization.
G. Assessment of Outcome
25.   The Project's achievements are considerably above appraisal expectations. At that time,
the objectives were to unbundle and commercialize OKGT and create a friendlier environment
for foreign investments. Not only have these objectives been attained, but the Government has
also been able to privatize a substantial portion of the petroleum sector. Outstanding deficiencies
in the  sectoral, institutional and pricing framework are expected to be addressed during
Hungary's integration into the EU.
26.   MOL staff have performed particularly well in the implementation of the technical
components of the project. The design criteria were nearly universally achieved and the agreed
In particular, the price of gas at the well head is cost based and not market based (it should be equivalent to that
of imported gas to give MOL an incentive to invest in exploration). Furthermore, assets have not been revalued
since 1991. Average annual inflation over 1991-97 has been 17.5%.
2   The Bank agreed in February 1996 to refrain from exercising its remedies prior to privatization, in the event
MOL continues to fail in meeting the covenant.

time schedules adhered to. Subprojects have nearly all met or exceeded the expected performance
criteria. As the project was still appraised under the past economic system, when a Bank loan
could be expected to be the only source of foreign exchange available for some time to come, the
foreign component for this loan may have been overestimated. Training programs were well
balanced and full advantage was taken from the Technical Assistance component of the project.
Overall the outcome of the project can certainly be rated as highly satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
27.   MOL's standing allows the company to access the international capital markets
advantageously. MOL has now acquired practically all the modern technologies as well as the in-
house to compete successfully in the international markets. Consequently, a further follow-up
project for oil and gas production is not realistic.
28.   The single area where more progress should have been made relates to the testing and
development of Hungary's geothermal potential by reentering abandoned oil and gas wells. There
are about one thousand such wells, many of which have indicated high bottom hole temperatures.
Missions have often discussed the possibility of testing the potential of some of these wells, but
this has not materialized. Environmental constraints such as the disposal of highly saline water
stand in the way. However for three projects a pre-feasibility study has been carried out with
promising results, which should be followed up by feasibility studies including reconditioning of
the wells, preliminary testing of water flows, well head temperatures etc. A suitable project might
eventually benefit from Global Environmental Fund support.
1. Key Lessons Learned
29.   The key lessons learned are:
i. financial covenants should be used flexibly enough, so that, under a changing
financial/business environment, they can be revised expeditiously in order not to create
unnecessary difficulties;
ii. the Bank should have alerted the authorities at an early stage regarding the inadequate
basis for pricing natural gas at the well head under the present regulatory framework;
iii. when a Borrower is really motivated to undertake reforms, these can be achieved over
a relatively short time span provided that the external environment is also favorable; and
iv. the project was a proper vehicle to introduce policy reforms and operational concepts
as used by international oil companies. However the Bank should not have pursued
broader sectoral pricing objectives (beyond oil and gas) under a petroleum project. These
covenants proved unenforceable.

in gas pricing shown in Annex 7-1 of SAR. Forecast rates of return are based on MOL's currently applicable and forecast
transport fees.

Re: Final Report
Project: 3056 HU CREDIT - Energy Development and Energy
Saving
Dear Mr. Busz,
Main objectives of the project
The loan provided funds, through making available a World Bank
credit of USD 100 million, permitting the acquisition of prospecting
devices previously impossible to be purchased for the Hungarian
mining (due to COCOM), the implementation of petroleum and
natural gas producing projects, the establishment of underground
storages, and an essential modernization of the oil and gas industry
infrastructure.



2
During the multiphase coordinatiorT precedfrrg re srgrrrrTg of the
contract it was accepted by the World Bank that the large-scale
projects scheduled to start in oil mining after 1990 form part of the
loan project through import acquisitions by the use of the World
Bank credit. This meant a help for us to have implications in the
longer term. The acquisition of the most up-to-date surface and well
geophysics devices, which permit a major increase in the efficiency
of prospecting, is of great significance from the aspect of longer-
term hydrocarbon prospecting, and therefore the Hungarian
Government would like to express its thanks. (In view of the
complex technical contents of the project the detailed evaluation is
carried out by MOL Co.)
We feel it necessary to emphasize on the part of the Ministry that
we were greatly content with the continuous activity of MOL Co.,
NBH and the World Bank during the implementation of the program
and we are sure that the results achieved will continue acting.
Delays in the declaration of intent
From 1983 the Hungarian Governments succeeding one another
had made commitments (SALT) towards increasing consumer
prices in their declarations of intent given to the World Bank.
However, in view of the low incomes of the Hungarian households
and for avoiding social tensions a postponement till 1995 of the
implementation of the commitment had been requested. The World
Bank took note of the postponement subject to the condition that all
state subsidization should have been phased out from consumer
prices by 1992. The Hungarian side met this requirement; since
1992 energy consumer prices for households have been including
no state subsidy. However, satisfaction of the commitment made by
the Government was delayed till as late as January 1, 1997.
The transparency of price change
In 1990 the price level differentiation having been applied to four
zones on the higher energy consumer price level was terminated.
Oil product prices were liberalized on January 1, 1991. The central
administrative control of liquefied gas and coal prices ceased on
March 1, 1992.



3
The Government control on the price formation of oil products was
fully eliminated in 1992. The retail and wholesale prices of oil
products are now market-regulated. MOL Co. still making supplies
to almost three fourths of the Hungarian market fixes the prices of
refinery products in consideration of the international market price
level - usually those of the Mediterranean region - in order that it
could be competitive with the imported products.
The HUF devaluations implemented after 1992 continued increasing
the price level differentials between the energies with uncontrolled
prices and the network energies bearing administrative prices due
to the fact that the latter were corrected for inflation with regard to
producer prices but not as regards consumer prices. The sale of
various products covered prime costs by implementing cross
financing between profitable producer prices and loss-making
consumer prices. The frequent price level increases overshadowed
changes in tariff elements and structures.
The natural gas and electricity prices and the price of the heat
supplied by power stations - these being administrative prices -
were approved by the minister of industry and trade in agreement
with the minister of finance, pursuant to Act LXXVII of 1991 on the
determination of prices.
The energy law provisions relating to price require that prices
should include all costs of energy production and supply, with the
stipulation that they should be determined in consideration of the
principle of least cost planning. These parts of the law entered into
force only on January 1, 1997.
As long as these prices had not come up to the economically
justified level, that part of the energy sector (electric power and
natural gas industry) produced no profit, and most of the affected
companies had been loss-making till 1996.



4
In September 1994 the Hungarian Energy Office made its first
proposals for the termination of cross subsidization through gradual
increases in gas and electric power prices.
After 1989 electric power prices increased at a slow rate. The price
increase introduced on January 1, 1995 for the. consumer price of
electric power at an average rate of 31 per cent raised for the first
time household tariffs slightly over commercial and industrial tariffs.
On January 1, 1995, the price of gas for households was increased
by 53 per cent on average and for industry and non-household
users by 9 per cent. Electricity prices increased on average by 65
per cent for households and 18 per cent for industry.
In September 1995 a global 8 per cent increase was made, and in
1996 further price increases occurred to the extent of 18 to 25 per
cent so that prices for households were increased in a greater
measure than those for intermediate users, the goal being a
decrease in cross-subsidizing.
On January 1, 1997, natural gas price was increased by 18,8 % and
electricity prices were increased by 24,9 %. The determination of
prices occurs on the basis of a price formula including various cost
factors .
Pursuant to the price law, the price authority tasks with regard to
district heating and hot water supply are seen to by local
government bodies of representatives. Electric power and gas tariffs
are uniform in the whole country.
The electric power law of 1994 laid down the general principles of
price determination, including an enumeration of the specific factors
to be taken account of. Pursuant to the said law, the prices of
electric power production, transport, distribution and supply have to
cover the costs related to the following:
* the implementation of justified projects, the acquisition of
efficiently operating equipment, profits necessary for lona-term
operation and development.



5
the  assurance  of  reserve  capacity,  environmental and
international obligations related to the closing down of power
stations, and viewpoints of economic policy and safety of supply.
The law forbids 'unjustified' discrimination between consumers.
Cross subsidization prevailed even after the price rise in January
1995, though on a much lower level, and it was eliminated by the
end of 1996. This process included a change in household tariffs of
a type which divides in a staggered manner the annual consumption
of households in three tariff zones and makes unit prices increase
progressively between the individual consumption zones as a
function of aggregate consumption.
It is to be emphasized that regarding both electricity and natural gas
the elimination of cross subsidizing occurs through the introduction
of special measures, including the provision of support for those
most in need.
As already mentioned, the method of price determination for electric
power and natural gas changed from 1997.
The Hungarian Energy Office (HEO) is responsible for determining
the principles of price regulation to be applied and elaborating the
details of the relevant formulas. The policy of price determination is
to focus on the determination of 'reasonable costs' and to provide
cost efficiency incentives. The principle of price determination laid
down in the legal rule permits the establishment of a price level
covering cost-proportional expenditures and assuring an 8 per cent
assets-related profit.
Summing up
In the period 1990 to 1997 energy prices for households increased
approximately six- or sevenfold, and at the same time the rate of
exchange of HUF fell by one third. Accordingly. the increase in
energy prices was well in excess of the rate of inflation.



6
The consumer prices of energy resources in Hungary still fall short
of the European price level.
The establishment of a systematic tariff structure of network-
supplied energies has been begun.
Taxes
From 1995 a general turnover tax (VAT) has been added to energy
prices. The VAT rate is 12 per cent for all energy sources, except
engine petrol, diesel fuel and gas oil, for which it is 25 per cent. The
VAT of fuels is fully refunded to enterprises. Fuels carry three more
taxes: excise tax, environmental tax, and contribution to the road
fund. The gas oil (light fuel oil for industrial purposes) carries an
excise tax. No tax is imposed onr heavy fuel oil.
In the middle of 1994 some two thirds of the consumer price of
petrol was made up of taxes and charges. The proportion has since
increased. The unleaded petrol carries lower environmental tax.
The trend of energy source prices is shown by the figures in the
following tables.

now.

The energy price relations (coat, fuel oil, natural gas) covered by the
producer price system reflect no energy policy endeavours.
therefore all large boilers are so installed that they should use the
safest, cheapest (and most reliable) natural gas.

Compensation
The introduction of higher prices raises serious concerns, often
appearing insurmountable, for a fairly large portion of the
popuiation. The number of those having accumulated major arrears
in their bill payments as well as of the bills left unpaid and the
amounts on them remaining uncollectable is constantly growing. A
compensation scheme to affect those most in need is in the process
of elaboration. The budget will be able to provide funds for it with
very severe limitations. The suppliers are ready to add minor sums
to the funds for compensation.
Energy policy
The basic principles of the Hungarian energy policy were laid down
by Parliament in its Decree 21/1993. (IV.9.). These include the need
to increase the safety of supply, energy saving and energy
efficiency, to observe the lowest cost principle with the development
of the energy system, and to increase the role of public awareness
in making energy decisions. A special requirement calls for the
creation of an organizational, legal and economic environment
based on market mechanisms in order that the Hungarian energy
economy could gradually adjust to the emerging uniform European
energy market.
Gradual phasing out of coal mining and uranium mining
The Hungarian Government had for a long time considered it an
important task to transform coal mining having been faced with
serious  concerns  and  operating  with  major  Government
subsidization and to terminate uranium mining.
In 1990 the Government set up an Office for the Restructuring of
Coal Mining and vested it with the licence to initiate liquidation.
The least efficient mines were closed down. The obligations
remaining after the termination of the mining activity (closing down.
landscape reconstruction, annuities, sale of assets or letting them
on lease) are seen to by joint stock companies for the utilization of
mine assets.



9
Pursuant to the agreement between the Govemrmerrt arnct thre Trade
Union Federation of Mine Workers mines and power stations were
to undergo integration, which was realized by the middle of 1994,
and such integrations have since played an important role in electric
power supply. Their future fate is subject to the results achieved in
tendering for the establishment of power station capacities and to
investors' intentions.
The small mines having remained outside the integrations (three or
four in number) are to be closed down in the short or medium term.
They depend a lot on social and employment policy constraints.
Due to unfavourable geological conditions, the limited size of the
occurrence, and the related inefficiency of utilization, uranium
production was terminated and the uranium mine was closed in the
autumn of 1997 on the basis of a Government decision. The
elimination of natural and environmental damages is to last until
2002 under a landscape rehabilitation programme.
Legal regulation
It is an important element in the implementation of the Hungarian
energy policy that the legal regulation relating to the energy sector
was entirely renewed. Several laws were drafted and passed by the
National Assembly, including those on mining (Act XLVIII of 1993),
gas supply (Act XLI of 1994), the production, transport and supply of
electric power (Act XLVII of 1994), nuclear energy (Act CXVI of
1996) and the safe stock-holding of petroleum and petroleum
products. Though at their adoption these laws complied with the EU
ones, it may occur that some of them might require an amendment
in consideration of measures subsequently taken in the EU.
Energy efficiency
Pursuant to the requirement laid down in the energy policy a
national programme of action for energy conservation and efficiency
increase was elaborated which was approved by the Government in
1995.



10
In addition to the operation of the package of measures aimed at
improving efficiency due consideration needs to be given to the fact
that the most important promoters in this context shall be a radical
transformation of the structure of industry, the phasing out of
energy-intensive and -less income-generating branches, and the
introduction of branches (product families, manufactures) where the
value generated is high in relation to the use of a unit of energy.
The experiences of recent years have shown that from 1994 the
expansion of Hungarian exports and the major growth of the GDP
and of industrial production have been achieved without the use of
additional energy. The breakdown by sectors of total (primary and
electric) energy use after 1990 is shown by the following table.
Totat energy use (GJ)

1997*    360     10      40     52    400    193  1 1055
* preliminary data
The total energy use of the producing sphere decreased by 2 per
cent between 1994 and 1997, including a 3.6 per cent less energy
intensity for industry. It can be seen without a detailed analysis that
high  energy-intensity  industrial branches  (metallurgy, cement
industry etc.) have been phased out and much less energy-
intensive consumers (e.g. motor industry) have appeared instead.
The Hungarian economy has embarked upon the road of European-
type development - including the energy efficiency aspect -, which
will result in higher energy needs only after a period of several
years.
Privatization
In the spring of 1994 the National Assembly adopted the law on gas
and electric power. This made possible a speeding up of
privatization. In its decrees of December 1994 the Government set



I1
the end of 1995 as a deadlirTe for the privatization of the whole of
the gas industry and the completion of the first phase of the
privatization of the electricity companies.
In the course of the preparation of privatization MITT and HEO
elaborated the decrees related to the sectoral laws, issued the
necessary licences, and the government decrees determining the
price trend in the years to come were adopted.
In August 1995 the Government laid down the conditions of
privatization in a decree. In accordance with them, the most
important objectives of privatization were as follows:
* achieving a maximum of budget revenues,
* promotion of the appearance of professional investors in the
electric power industry and the gas supply companies (contrarily,
the minority stake of MOL Co. was offered to financial investors),
 prevention of vertical and horizontal monopoly situations,
 attraction of new capital in the interests of streamlining the sector.
The first round of privatization was successfully completed at the
end of 1996. All gas and electricity suppliers and the two largest
power stations identified for privatization had been sold, just as well
as 20.32 per cent of MOL Co.'s shares. The privatization continued
in 1997.
Ownership relations in the oil and gas industry (January 1,
1998)
Due to privatization, the ownership structure of MOL Co. has
changed as follows
Owners of MOL Co. (January 1, 1998)
Ownership

The privatization of the six large gas supply companies has not
fundamentally changed the regions. The professional investors
acquired ownership shares in the long-standing supply companies
and also participate in the work of the management. The ownership
situation is as follows:

HUNGARY
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
1.    The implementation of the key project objectives coincided with the systemic
change in Hungary. Planned privatization of the energy sector triggered major changes
in the principles of the energy sector. Priority was given to business and market
considerations. The governnent began to liberate energy prices.
2.    Prices of motor fuels were to be adjusted to international price levels and state
subsidies fully eliminated. Natural gas prices would be brought to international price
levels only through a gradual approach due to social considerations, but state subsidies
were eliminated in this field. As a result of ongoing government measures, MOL will be
enabled to earn 8% return on assets employed in the gas sector. Gas prices are to be
reviewed quarterly in line with the devaluation of the Hungarian forint. There is still no
solution to the problem of reflecting the cost of underground storage operations and the
expenses due to seasonality in the gas prices.
3.    Restructuring of former OKGT had a predominant role in the implementation of
the oil and gas sector development. Simultaneously with the formation of MOL, i.e. on
1 October 1991., the gas distribution and service companies were spun-off from MOL,
as this was exactly the direction pointed out by the World Bank. To finance its projects,
MOL raises loans as the long term loan facilities offered by foreign banks and other
lending institutions. Foreign companies were granted exploration and production
concession rights, but foreign partners made investments in this sector only in the filling
station business. Privatization of the sector is going on and MOL's new shareholders are
mostly foreign financial investors. Industrial investors could capture ownership in the
regional gas distribution companies and in the filling stations - these investments
represent significant amount of foreign capital.
4.    MOL  applies  the  principle  of rigorous energy  conservation  in  the
implementation of its developments, and the emerging competition in the region
underlines the significance of this tendency.
B. Implementation of Project Objectives
a. Financial
5.    During the implementation of the Project MOL was exposed to major macro-
economic impacts and, at the same time, opportunities arising through the
implementation of the Project reacted upon the macro-economic decisions and actions
taken. Adjusting motor fuel prices to international price levels had a significant inter-
relationship with the taxation regime of the sector and its products. This issue is briefly
summarized in the following section.
6.    The basis for calculating royalty is the value generated after the value of the
produced domestic crude oil and natural gas. No royalty is payable after crude oil
-1-

Of MOL
produced through the application of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. EOR
technologies and methods were explored and further improved within thea WQrld Bank
Project, and the C02 injection method, with far the best results in this kind, was also
implemented under the Project. The government offered a royalty-free status to support
such up-to-date methods.
7.    Tax rate for motor fuels and fuel oils is in a band between HUIF 67,60/1 and
86,70/1. Tax for gas products is HUEF 41,80/cu m. Tax rate for lubricants and additives is
HUF 60,80/kg. This tax is paid by the party subject to tax obligation, in the excise duty,
as part of the excise duty. In addition, there is an environment tax imposed onto
lubricants, fuel oils not complying with the Hungarian Standards, and fuel oil with
sulfur content higher than 2,8%. The present rate of royalty for MOL is 12%. Products
of our sector are subject to excise duty (consumption tax), road tax and environment tax.
Road tax (contribution to the road fund) after the motor fuels is also paid in the excise
duty. In the first semi-year of 1998, the Road Fund will get 26,38% of its total funding
from such road tax paid after motor fuels.
8.    Motor fuel prices are liberated market prices, but taxation has a significant
impact upon them. Natural gas price is regulated by the government applying a so-called
"Price Formulae" and this system will remain in place from 1 January 1997 and 31
December 2001. The purpose of this price formulae is to create a cost-based price
system that accounts for the cost of the Hungarian gas sector and the price of imported
gas. Gas prices are revised and corrected quarterly using this formulae, and, at the same
time, changes in the rate of exchange (HUF/USD) are also taken into account, because
gas import agreements are concluded on USD prices. (See: Enclosure 2.)
9.    Macro-economic measures highlighted the profitability of energy generation and
also influenced the direction of developments to be implemented in the energy sector,
therefore such developments gradually became independent from the state budget.
plants and units found not profitable enough were abandoned and reduced, but there was
no dramatic shut down in this respect.
10.   Environmental protection was given a totally new interpretation during the
implementation of the Project. Various measures taken for environmnental protection at
govemrnental levels integrated the environmental requirements also initiated by the
World Bank. Presently MOL can primarily feel the cost and burdens emerging from
such measures, but investments made in enviromnental protection will recover such cost
through benefits in product quality.
11.   Macro-economic measures also improved the level of management with the
sector's resources and required for the maximum exploitation of profitability of projects.
12.   Gas prices, since 1997, are determined by the Hungarian Energy Office (HEO)
on the basis of the Gas Act and subsequent decrees, which provide inter alia that MOL
is entitled to an 8% return on proportional equity. The World Bank Mission noted that
assets have not been revalued since 1991, while the base year for valuing assets is 1995
-- as a result the gas asset base is undervalued (this also applies to the balance of MOL's
assets). Furthermnore, additional investments have been put into operation since 1995,
and they are not included in the asset base.
13.   While exploration/production and transport were entitled to a return in the tariff
calculation in prior years, it is only starting in 1997 that a return was recognized on gas
-2-



Implementation Completion Report
Of MOL
storage. Given that there was an agreed basis to quantify the return to which we are
entitled on gas exploration/production and transmission within Hungary, the balance left
for storage turned out to be insufficient, which explains the low return obtained on these
projects. We would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to express our lack of
satisfaction with the well-head price, which is cost based and not market based.
14.   The World Bank included conditions related to the liquidity of MOL (current
ratio), the level of debt (debt/equity ratio), new debt (debt service coverage ratio) and
the return on assets. MOL had no difficulty in complying with the first three conditions;
on the other hand, the 15% return on assets condition proved difficult to company given
the control over gas prices (on social and other grounds) and the exposure of MOL to
the petroleum market since 1991 (since then, MOL has to be competitive with imports).
The rate of return on assets condition became particularly difficult to comply with
following the revaluation of assets in 1991. The bank suspended the condition during
the privatization of MOL, and we have recently requested that the condition be waived
altogether, as it no longer reflects MOL operating environment, as explained above.
15.   MOL now operates on a strictly commercial basis, and aims to maximize value
to its shareholders. As a result, all of our projects are subject to strict economic
feasibility studies and other financial criteria, and we are continuously aiming at
improving our efficiency. At the same time, we attach importance to preserve the
environment, and contribute to the development of the Hungarian economy. Priority is
laid to increase the cash flow, whereas we also monitor rising share prices, and, in this
context, we determine the dividends to secure the return for investors (shareholders).
MOL is more than keen to ensure that MOL's value keep on improving.
b. Organizational
16.   MOL's legal predecessor, OKGT was transformed into a new company on I
October 1991 through the implementation of various organizational changes. This
implied that the former trust form of company, incorporating several subsidiaries, was
transformed into an integrated joint stock company. MOL retained its core activities in
the oil and gas sector and the gas distribution and service/background companies were
spun-off. As a result, decisions on operation and investments could be reached in
accordance with profitability criteria, the organization became more efficient and
flexible, and adequate for meeting the challenges triggered by new challenges in the
markets.
17.   Since the formation of MOL the Hungarian State has exercised a major control
over the Company's strategy, business management and direction. Following the
privatization process, the Hungarian State will retain 25% shareholding ratio plus the
Golden Share, enabling it to continue to have major influence over MOL. Furthermore,
the Company's Articles of Association also contain clear restrictions on ownership and
voting rights.
18.   MOL's organizational structure has been  continually  restructured  and
modernized in the past years and it has now reached a fairly consolidated form of
structure. MOL has established two business groups for its core activities: Exploration
and Production (E&P) and Refining and Marketing (R&M). R&M Group covers crude
import and refining, wholesale and retail trading and marketing of oil products, and
production and marketing of lubricants and bitumen products. E&P is responsible for oil
-3-



Implementation Completion Report
Of MOL
and gas exploration in Hungary and abroad, field development and production,
purchase, transportation, wholesale trading of natural gas including uud=gound gas
storage operations, and crude oil transportation. There are several business units
operating under this business group structure, each of them has its own liner of
responsibility. MOL's present organizational structure is shown in Enclosure ...
19.   MOL outplaced non-core operations into affiliate companies, and, furthermore,
it invested into various other companies, thus next to MOL a group of companies was
established where MOL has various shareholding ratios.
20.   As the number of such companies grew, MOL decided in December 1997 to
restructure this portfolio of affiliate companies. The purpose is to establish a new fully
owned company, MOL-INVEST to manage affiliates carrying out non-core operations.
Such affiliate companies will then be either divested or managed as financial
investrnents for operation aspects. Other affiliates, directly connected to MOL's core
business, e.g. companies in the field of petrochemistry, will remain in MOL ownership
and be controlled through MOL's strategic, financial and services systems. As a result
of this restructuring MOL will be able to rationalize its activities on group levels.
21.   Each project of MOL is subject to an profitability evaluation and feasibility
analysis to secure profitability, this method is similar to the approach used by the World
Bank for projects financed by World Bank loans. The first international lender of MOL
was the World Bank. MOL also contacted other multi-national lending agencies, like
EBRD and EIB, as well as with international commercial banks. To facilitate such
cooperation, MOL also prepares its balance sheet and profit and loss accounts in
accordance with IAS requirements. MOL applies a 'cash-pool' system to finance major
affiliates. MOL is becoming from a national company into an international corporation,
purchasing inter-national exploration and production concessions, expanding in the
region, dominantly through constructing new filling stations in Slovakia and Romania,
and 52,1% of MOL shares are held by international financial investors, as a result of
privatization.
c. Environment
22.   MOL implements major projects also in the area of environmental protection. A
central environment protection function was established with responsibilities to manage
and control such activities and operations. New projects are implemented in full
compliance with the rigorous environmental requirements. When reconstruction of old
plants and units is carried out, compliance with such standards is always a key priority.
C. Project implementation and main factors impacting such implementation
23.   Project implementation  was  dominantly  influenced  by  factors  under
governmental control. The CAPEX requirements of the sub-projects had to be
permanently re-evaluated due to inflation and price increase. Partial convertibility of
HUF significantly simplified the procurement process. Local affiliates of major
international companies appeared in Hungary and this enabled MOL to purchase
equipment for forint. This is the main reasons why MOL did not use the entire loan
amount despite the fact that the project was completed in accordance with the original
program. In the area of construction MOL could feel the effects of measures taken by
-4-



Implementation Completion Report
Of MOL
the government to enhance the development of market economy. Invitation to bids
becarne a normal practice, competition of suppliers and contractors emerged and this
had an advantageous impact upon the performance, and the contracted completion dates
could be kept more easily.
24.   Cooperation with the environmental authorities became more difficult, primarily
due to lack of experiences and gaps in the legislation and regulations. Production start
up of Bajansenye-6riszentpeter gas field had to be deleted from the program because of
unsettled environmental issues.
Procurement of exploration equipment
25.   The purpose of this procurement was to purchase various field equipment.
Through the acquisition of this equipment MOL was able to make 3D surveys and thus
efficiency and reliability of exploration greatly improved. Deep drilling, well-
geophysical, well testing and geological service operations could be performed on a
significantly higher level. The purchased software for integrated geological
interpretation system secured improving levels in geological interpretation.
26.   As a result of application of such equipment, the level of the domestic
exploration operations could get close to intemational standards and this was a major
contribution to MOL's ability to begin intemational exploration projects abroad.
Technical assistance and training (See: Enclosure 9.)
a. Management Information system
27.   The first phase of MIS Study was prepared by Price Waterhouse, however
MOL's restructuring was at an initial phase in 1992 therefore the system proposed in the
said study was not implemented. Later MOL decided to implement a SAP program
package. This system was fully implemented, is operational and is permanently
maintained and upgraded.
b. Contract Economics
28.  In this program MOL employed the services and support of a USG/USA expert
who participated in the preparation of a modem mining law. We contracted the services
of R.W. Pleasant law firm to prepare a framework agreement model for participating in
oil and natural gas exploration and production in Hungary. The development in the
Legal Framework for petroleum exploration and production is shown in Annex I.
c. Organizational Development
29.   MOL employed the services of TOTAL's experts for this program. Experiences
were collected and processed, as part of the training program. Later MOL contacted and
visited Shell and utilized their experiences in finalizing its own structure.

d. Export Potentials
30.   MOL's export potentials were analyzed by Gaffney/USA company. The purpose
was to identify the areas where MOL could enter into international exploration and
production operations. MOL acquired practices and methods for project evaluation and
international financing applied by international companies and this is currently utilized
for MOL's international exploration and production projects.
e. Exploration team
31.   MOL expert acquired techniques for international concessions and acquisition,
studied the preparation of exploration and production agreements, and such experiences
were successfully applied in MOL's international exploration and production operations.
f. Improvement of field development
32.   Based on experiences MOL prepared exploitation analysis of Kiskunhalas field.
Such experiences were also applied in exploitation of other fields.
g. Water Treatment and Corrosion
33.   MOL studied various methods and techniques for decontamination and
redemption of emulsion compounds, solid and other pollutants, problems related to
internal and external anti-corrosion for pipelines and tanks. Application of these
methods resulted in a reduction of operational disturbances and break-downs, as well as
maintenance and repair costs.
h. Well stimulation, drilling, completion and testing
34.   The purpose of training was to study modern well stimulation, well treatmnent
and chemical methods to enhanced oil recovery operations prior to field abandonment.
MOL also studied horizontal drilling technology which was then successfully applied in
Hungary and resulted in significant extra oil production.
i. Geological Studies
35.   MOL obtained skills and methods in modern geological models and 3D seismic
geophysical modeling that enabled MOL to identify and survey geological structures not
accessible by any other methods.
j. Training programs
36.   Training programs offered opportunities to acquire the most up-to-date
technologies, and methods in modern corporate management.
37.   In the field of HR operations MOL's experts could familiarize themselves with
modern benefit systems and a similar system was then introduced in MOL. Training
programs in the fields of finance and accounting were aimed at better knowledge in
financial risk management and various financing solutions.
38.   The above training programs practically covered all segments of MOL's
operations and greatly contributed to MOL's capability to develop and become a modern
international oil and gas company.

Development and production projects
a. Nagylengyel
39.   As part of the EOR program, the CO2 injection method was also applied in
blocks VII.-VIII.-X. of this field. The incremental oil production will be 219.300 ton by
2010-end.
b. Barcs-West
40.   This subproject refers to a gas field at the Hungarian-Croatian border. De-
sulphurization of gas was successfully resolved. Natural gas production will be 578,5
MCM and condensate production will be 464,500 ton by 2004-end.
C. UllIs
41.   Cooling equipment was applied to prepare the gas for transmission. 120.200 ton
oil and 1.561.6 MCM gas will be produced from 1990 up to 2005-end. The sulfur
content of the gas is presently 40-50 ppm and we applied a temporary treatment method
(chemicals) to reduce the sulfur content below the locally permissible levels specified
for gas transmission. MOL is currently exploring opportunities to install a de-
sulphurisation unit, as a final solution to the problem.
d. Szeghalom, Mez6sas
42.   As a result of reserve audit by WESTERN ATLAS INT., the originally
forecasted reserves had to be revised and reduced. As a consequence, the originally
projected amount of loan disbursement also significantly reduced.
e. Algy6
43.   The purpose of the project was to modernize production facilities, de-
sulphurization of natural gas, expansion of water injection method and enhance recovery
ratio. Production data: 3884 thousand ton oil and 3481,4 MCM gas will be produced
from 1990 up to 2000-end. The de-sulphurization unit supplied by TITAN (Canada) did
not work properly. MOL therefore called the performance bond and have the unit
repaired using this amount. The unit has been performing satisfactorily since March
1997.
f. Tazldr
44.   The content of the project was (a) to separate C02 gas from the gas produced
from the gas reservoirs in the field and (b) to inject such C02 gas into Szank oil field as
part of EOR operations. Oil production will be 434.400 ton and gas production 2982,8
MCM in Szank field between 1993 and 2004. The cylinder of one of the compressors
repeatedly developed over-heating and the supplier (TOYO -Japan) was unable to
resolve the problem. The supplier paid back a portion of the purchase price to cover the
extra costs incurred. MOL used this amount and had the trouble repaired.
g. Trans-Tisza Region
45.   We gathered production from five minor gas reservoirs (Mez6peterd, Furta,
F6ldes-East, F6ldes-West and Biharkeresztes) and transported to the existing gas plant

at Hajduszoboszl6. Condensates production will be 302.700 ton, and gas production will
be 1577,5 MCM by 2010.
46.   The detailed information for the above subprojects is shown in Enclosures 3.a-
3.g. All the above subprojects have been completed before the original closing date of
the Loan (December 1995).
Gas Storage Sub-projects
47.   The purpose of creating incremental underground gas storage was to be able to
meet the peak winter demand within the context of the country's gas supply/demand
balances up to the year 2000. Gas storage capacities were increased in the existing
reservoirs at Pusztaederics and Kardoskut, and new storage capacity at Zsana in addition
to the existing total capacity of 1050 MCM and the ongoing implementation of the
Hajdiu-szoboszl6 storage. The subprojects under this Project are summarized below. The
supply/ demand balance for gas 1989-1997 (actual) and 1998-2000, together with the
underground storage capacities required and created are shown in Annex "Gas Balance
Table, Enclosure....
a. Pusztaederics
47.   The goal of the project was to increase the underground storage capacity
There was no utilization of World Bank Loan for this subproject.
b. Zsana
48.   New underground gas storage capacity (600.000 MCM) was required, including
the construction of a 48,7 km pipeline. The program was successfully completed in
1997.
c. Kardoskit
49.   The purpose of the project was to increase the capacity of this underground gas
storage facility to 210 MCM. The program was completed in 1993. The present storage
capacity (licensed by the authorities) is 260 MCM.
Pipeline and Telecommunication Sub-projects
a. Endr6d-VArosfold gas pipeline
50.   This project was to duplicate the existing pipeline (DN 600 mm, length 72 km)
with the construction of a 800 mm pipeline to meet increasing gas consumption.
The program was completed in 1992.
b. Pilisvor6svar-Gy6r gas pipeline
51.   MOL constructed a 127 km long, 600 mm diameter pipeline to secure gas supply
for North-West Hungary.

c. Expansion and modernization of gas odorization system
52.   The purpose of the program was to construct a new gas odorization system in the
Hungarian pipeline system, to reduce pollution problems and to increase the capacity of
the existing system.
d. Development of the telemechanic system
53.   The goal of the program was to expand and modernize the existing telemechanic
system, and to secure reliable control of the national oil and gas pipeline network.
e. Development of the telecommunication system in the gas sector
54.   The existing system was expanded and modernized, cable and wireless systems
were inter-connected, telephone exchanges were upgraded and the microwave system
was installed in this program.
f. Modernization of MOL telephone central
55.   The outdated telephone system at MOL's head office was replaced with an up-to-
date system.
g. Beregdar6c Compressor Station
56.   The purpose of the subproject was to de-bottleneck the station capacity (in 3
active compressors of 340 MCM  per hour capacity to 640 MCM  per hour per
compressor.
57.   MOL wished to adopt a different technical solution and procurement method and
withdrew this subproject from Bank financing. The subproject was fully completed with
station capacity of about 800 MCM per hour per compressor exceeding the initial
expectations. The station is operating satisfactorily since 1990.
h. Measurement System Modernization
58.   This subproject was also withdrawn from bank financing in 1991, since
implementation had already commenced before the World Bank loan became effective.
The subproject has been implemented under MOL's own financing, completed in July
1992, fully in accordance with Appraisal expectations, and is operating satisfactorily
fully meeting the performance criteria.
Downstream sub-projects (See: Enclosure 5a-b)
a. Modernization of product storage and truck loading
59.   The purpose of the project was to modernize the six largest truck loading
systems (loading bays), two barge loading facilities and the product pipeline measuring
system in Hungary.
b. Safety storage
60.   680.000 cu.m. storage tankage was reconstructed in this project. The program
was completed in 1997.

D. Project sustainability
61.   Socio-economic transformation in Hungary started with the systemic changes in
Hungary and its direction coincided with the objectives set by the project. Results of
such systemic changes became consolidated in Hungary therefore the project
sustainability is properly secured from the government side. MOL completed the
organizational transformation and this new structure was fully in line with the
requirements specified by the World Bank. MOL's privatization has been completed
therefore all internal and external factors drive MOL to the direction to sustain and
retain its present consolidated ownership structure and organization. New mechanisms
were developed in MOL's operation (e.g. profitability analysis of new projects,
monitoring profitability indicators, tracking, inter alia, debt indicators). These are
guarantees for MOL to sustain the current achievements.
E. Bank's Performance
62.   The performance of the World Bank in the preparation of the entire project and
the selected sub-projects was fully satisfactory. The Bank's contribution to the
cooperation between the Bank and MOL was acceptable throughout the project
implementation.
63.   Estimates made by the World Bank for the basic objectives of the project and to
the relevant perfornance of each sub-project is deemed fully adequate and accurate, as
proven by actual performance. Inspections and audits carried out at World Bank
Missions were efficient, quick and with down-to-earth approach, so they are regarded as
fully satisfactory.
F. MOL's Performance
64.   MOL could establish at commissioning of the project and the selected sub-
projects that technical-financial parameters were identical with planned figures, product
markets were secured in line with the forecasts. The government, as guarantor, provided
proper support to the project and monitored the progress.
65.   There was a two-year delay in project implementation. The main reason was the
organizational restructuring of MOL. MOL's performance is deemed as satisfactory
throughout the project implementation. The World Bank Project was always given a
priority by MOL.
66.   There were some minor technical disturbances or irregularities in the operation
of plants constructed within the project when suppliers delivered equipment with
parameters other than designed or planned. These issues were properly handled and
resolved by MOL.
G. Evaluation of Results
67.   The project, technically and financially, was closed by 31 December 1997. MOL
fulfilled all basic objectives of the project set by the World Bank, therefore the project
implementation was a success.

Implementation Completion Report
Of MOL
68.   MOL has been transformed into a joint stock company, and its ownership
structure has improved, the foreign ownership ratio is 52,1%. MOL's internal structure
has been transformed and the restructuring proposed by the World Bank has proven to
be adequate. Oil product prices have been fully liberated. Gas prices remained partially
regulated, but the tendency points towards gradually liberation.
69.   Oil and gas sector was developed and reached a satisfactory progress through the
project implementation. There is sufficient proof for MOL to believe that this process of
progress can be sustained by projects and investments to be implemented in the future.
MOL has begun international expansion through acquisition of foreign concessions and
constructing filling stations in the region.
70.   Energy and environmental conservation has become a key factor for decision-
making to approve new projects.
71. The project is deemed by MOL as successful and the experiences learned during the
project will be usefully applied by the company.
H. Conclusions/lessons.
72.   MOL has gained many experiences during project implementation and the key
conclusions are as follows.
73.   Good and thorough preparation of project is of utmost importance because only
this approach can secure profitable implementation of sub-projects.  Profitability
analysis should be carried out for each sub-project. Invitation to bid should always be
issued for suppliers and contractors to achieve lower prices and still good quality and
performance. For major programs (like the Energy Development Project) a central
organization should be set up for coordination of the entire program, facilitate
cooperation and contacts among the participating units and resolve any issue arising
during implementation. Compliance of deadlines is of paramount significance
throughout the entire project. Any delay may lead to increasing CAPEX of the project
and have a disadvantageous impact upon project profitability.
74.   Cooperation between the World Bank and MOL was deemed to be highly
satisfactory throughout the project life cycle. Representatives of the World Bank
practically remained the same officers thus a friendly and intimate atmosphere could be
developed and it facilitated the resolution of more difficult and complex issues with
mutual satisfaction. MOL believes that the approval procedures for procurement issues
is still quite rigid and bureaucratic in the World Bank. In case of MOL such procedures
were too rigorous and over-complicated because MOL has never attempted and had the
intention to misuse the funds ,made available by the World Bank. In this context it is
proposed that borrowers be treated in a differentiated manner and more reliable clients
be given a greater degree of flexibility. There is another negative comment: it is very
difficult to prepare a reliable plan for the interest payable even on short term, and the
amount of extra expenses due to changes in cross-currency can not be estimated.
75.   As a sumnmary, cooperation between the World Bank and MOL is regarded as
fairly successful in general, and MOL believes that the basic objectives of the project
have been fully met.

Annex I.
Development in the Legal Framework applicable to petroleum
exploration and production
Act Ill. of 1960 and the decree on implementation of the law regulated mining based
on the concept that all mineral resources are in state property and with a few
exceptions only state-owned mining companies are entitled to exploration and
production. The decision conceming basic exploration was made within the state
administration system, while decisions in connection with exploration aimed at
production were made at company level. Following successful exploration effective
production was started by establishing the mining land. The supervision of mining
rights and safety technical activities was performed by mining inspectorates created for
this purpose.
The Act XLVIII. of 1993 was passed by Parliament and the decree on implementation
issued after a long preparation process in 1993. The law entered into force on 12 June
1993 and overruled the fonner law. Mineral resources are still in state property, mining
entrepreneurs are entitled to pursue exploration and production. The law ensured the
succession of former rights, set a deadline for the completion of exploration, while the
terms and conditions for production remained the same. New mining entrepreneurs
may generally obtain rights for exploration, production and pipeline transportation by
concessions, while mining companies with a certain state holding through preferential
shares ensuring special rights, may obtain such rights by licensing. The new law
introduced the concept of open and restricted areas, where mining operations may be
canied out in different ways. The mining authority, dealing with safety technical
issues is still operating, and this organisation is responsible for delegating mining
rights and licensing.
Regulations concerning protection of the environment have a strong effect.
environmental issues, if supported by a resolution of the constitutional court, have
priority over other activities to such an extent that all previously commenced
operations must be stopped if justified by an environmental or nature conservancy
decision, i.e. the area or region was declared protected subsequently. Natlrally
licenses and consents from various authorities are required before any mining
operation commence, among them the environmental impact study is highlighted.
Following conclusion of mining operations, the area effected will be recultivated
appropriately.

MOOL 
HUNGARIAN  OIL & GAS                                        Golden Rated Sponsor
Company                                                 Oef the hungauin Olympic Team
Opirion on the draft Implementation Completion Report of the Energy Development and
Conservation Project (Loans 3056-TiM
Following the completion of the Energy Development and Conservation Project experts
of the World bank and MOL, as a joint in site mission, reviewed the circumstances of
project implementation, the transformation process of the last 10 years in THungary and
withiin MOL, and defined changes filUy or partially complying the project objectives. The
rnission evaluated the economic results of the projecl and summarized the conclusions
for both parties.
The drafL ICR provides a summary of statements defined at the said site visit on the
prcject and the impacts of the project. Despite the original objectives of the project, gas
prices could not be increased onto economically acceptable levels therefore the rate of
return of investments in the gas sector, primarily that of the underground gas storage
facilities has fallen short from expectations.
The draft TCR puts the appropriate emphasis onto this fact but fails to determine the
underlying reason. It was not the lack of intention that has resulted in failure in settling
gas prices but the lack of opportunity. Gas price in Hungary is a social issue and present
prices have reached the level of tolerance of the society. Gas prices can be increased only
together with the growth of the population's income, and in line with the growth rate.
Regulation of gas prices is, at the moment, necessary for this specific situation.
The completed project was evaluated as 'highly satisfactory' and we fully support with
this rating.
Direct and indirect impacts of project implementation have exerted significant influence
onto MOL and have resulted that MOL has become a dominant international oil and gas
company in the region. MOL has completed the transformation and restructuring of its
organization and modernized its intemal operations following the guidelines of the World
Bank and using the examples of similar Western European companies, as well as it
secured the up-to-date technical conditions for such operations. A new ownership
structure has been developed through privatization of MOL and this represents a
guarantee that achievements of the project will continue to have a pennanent and
eficient impact.
We agree with the present text of the draft ICR. We would appreciate the supplemcntary
text proposed for the explanation of regulatory price system for natural gas.
