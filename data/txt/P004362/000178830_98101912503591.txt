1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Education System.  Papua New Guinea has built a complete educa-
tion system within a short period - its first senior high school was opened
only about 20 years ago. The country has adopted a four-tiered education
system - primary, lower secondary, upper secondary and higher education (Table
1.1). The problems within the education system are severe and can be traced

to inadequacies in primary education. Selection processes (based on student
performance) which take place between grades 6-7 and 8-9 leave only about 20%
of the grade 6 cohort to sit for grade 10 examinations. But despite this
selection process, standards of grade 10 examinations have steadily declined
during the 1970s. The number of graduates at secondary and higher levels is
insufficient to meet urgent manpower needs, but quality problems in basic
education prevent an effective enrollment expansion at upper levels.
1.02      Education Costs.  Despite the sharply tapered education pyramid
(para. 1.01) expenditure on education, measured as a proportion of GNP, is the
highest in the Region at 5.4%. Recurrent unit costs are high,/1 particularly
above grade 10, which is predominantly taught by expatriates and is entirely
residential. Relatively small class size (31) and high teacher salaries at
the primary level also contribute to high unit costs. Taking into account the
wastage within the system, (30% dropout within the primary level and 35%
"force out" between grades 8-9) the unit cost per graduate at each level is
unacceptably high. Improved quality of education, reduced wastage, increased
reliance on local teaching staff above grade 10 and increased class size are
the principal requirements to reduce costs per graduate.
/1 National High Schools cost US$1,330/student/year and the University of PNG
US$5,860/student/year in 1976.

1.03      Bank Participation.  The Bank has been involved in one previous
education project, Credit 661-PNG of 1977, which is primarily concerned with
satisfying immediate manpower needs.  It assists in training agricultural
extension workers, health inspectors, primary- and secondary-level teachers
and middle level industrial technicians. Project implementation is generally
progressing well, but difficulties associated with reaching enrolment targets
for females indicate a socio-cultural constraint, which should be taken into
account in future project design. All project-financed facilities are
operational.
1.04      The proposed project was identified by a joint Bank/Unesco subsector
mission in April 1979 and prepared by the Government and a Unesco mission in
September 1979.  The findings of these missions formed the basis for pre-
appraisal, which was conducted in November/December 1979 and appraisal which
was conducted in July/August 1980./1  The proposed project would be assisted
by an IDA credit of US$12.0 million and a Bank loan of US$6.0 million and
would aim at:
(a) enhancing the capabilities for effective management of education
at national, provincial and school levels;
(b) raising the quality of primary education through improved
textbooks, materials and teacher training; and
(c)  promoting greater access to primary education by assistance to the
provinces to expand and improve existing schools and establish new
schools.
The proposed project is recommended for IDA/Bank financing because it: (a)
supports the Government-s development strategy for primary education, (b)
addresses major issues in the education sector; and (c) is well organized to
achieve its goals.
2. ISSUES IN PRIMARY EDUCATION /2
Overview
2.01      Significant progress was made prior to 1970 in expanding primary
education in PNG, but the primary enrollment ratio stagnated in the 1970s and
serious quality problems developed. Concentrated' efforts are needed to
improve access and quality in the 1980s.  Problems in the subsector fall into
four broad categories:
/1  Mission members at preappraisal were S. Sigurdsson (architect and
mission leader), F. Farner (general educator) and 0. Fajana
(economist). Appraisal was conducted by S. Sigurdsson and P. Aprieto
(textbook specialist, consultant).
/2 The primary education system is described in Working Papers, Section B.

(a)  Management.  The 1978 decentralization policy transferred most of
the administrative and financial responsibility for primary
education from the national Government to the provinces, but the
provinces lack trained staff to manage the work.
(b)  Quality.  Test results show that standards have steadil]- declined
during the 1970s.
(c)  Enrollment Stagnation.  Primary school enrollment ratios levelled
off at less than 60% during the 1970s.
(d)  Financial Constraints.  The Government has put a 3% growth ceiling
on its overall annual expenditures because of financial resource
constraints. Expansion of the education system should be linked
with economies to make better use of scarce resources.
Management
2.02      The Organic Law of 1977, which controls the decentralization policy,
became effective in 1979. In the education system the Central Government
retains exclusive control over education above grade 10 and school inspec-
torates at all levels. Control over curriculum at and below grade 10 is
shared between central and provincial governments; planning and management
of primary and lower secondary education rests primarily with the provinces.
Responsibilities of the Provincial Divisions of Education (PDOE) in primary
and lower secondary education include appointment of teachers, establishment
of new schools and related educational planning. Disbursement of funds and
adoption of curricula in subjects other than English, mathematics, science and
national or international components of social science are also provincial
responsibilities. Lack of adequately trained staff in each of the 20
provinces to carry out these diverse responsibilities is a serious constraint
to successful implementation of the decentralization policy. The provincial
education staff in each province includes only four educational managers, of
which only the superintendent has been trained in education admjnistration or
other relevant areas./l Thus the Organic Law delegated much of the
decision-making powers to the provinces, but the manpower to exercise this
power is often lacking.
2.03      The decentralization process is incomplete and uncertainties exist
about roles to be played by the national and provincial authorities.  Parts of
the decision-making power are being transferred to the provinces, but defini-
tion of responsibility is often lacking, particularly in the areas of shared
control (para. 2.02). A case in point is the development and production of
/1 Each province has 4-6 inspectors, but these are national officers
(para. 2.04 and Chart A).

teaching materials and textbooks in subjects outside national control
(para. 2.02). This activity is a provincial responsibility, but the "critical
mass" needed for a textbook program requires a major national involvement.
Anomalies also exist in the present staffing structure, developed in 1977.
According to this structure, provincially based education staff report to the
Provincial Superintendent of Education, with the exception of the inspectors
who report to the National Government (Chart 22095).  The result is that the two
essential elements of the team responsible for management and improvement of
primary education -- administration and supervision -- are separated
organizationally rather than placed under a single authority. A coordinated
program is needed to resolve issues arising from the decentralization process.
Such a program should include: (a) technical assistance for the preparation
of provincial plans and definition of responsibilities; and (b) intensive
training of local staff to assume managerial responsibilities.
Quality
2.04      Education standards are low and have been falling during the
1970s. Shortage of qualified teachers and lack of instructional materials
were major causes of this decline. Concentrated efforts, particularly in
teacher training and provision of textbooks, are needed to reverse the
trend. Systematic, objective primary school achievement measurements to
identify and quantify decline in primary education standards over time are
not available in PNG, but two partial indicators show that standards are
low and falling. Scores on the national examination given at the end of
grade 6 for selecting students to enter grade 7 show poor results. The
only detailed study available is based on 1977 data in 19 schools located in
rural and urban areas of 9 provinces. Scores were as follows in this
study:/l

The mean total score for the 19 schools (16.5 + 15.3 + 20.4) was 52 out of a
possible 117. Analysis of a sample of scores from the 1979 examination
produced a mean of about 45 out of a possible 115, or slightly lower than the
1977 results shown above./l These data suggest that in the vital subjects
of arithmetic and English, the typical child can correctly answer less than
half of the examination items.  The 1977 study also indicates that scores in
rural areas are significantly lower than in urban areas./2 Better statis-
tical evidence of downward trend in test results is available for the lower
secondary grades as shown in Table 2.2. While evidence at grade 10 does not
directly measure primary achievement, the problem can in part be attributed
to weaknesses at earlier levels of education and a persistent 25% decline over
a decade in the above six measures is significant. The large enrollment
increase in grades 7-10 between 1970-78 (from 17,600 to 33,000 while enroll-
ment in grades 1-6 grew only from 206,000 to 263,000) accounts for some of
the drop in standards, but the mission estimated weaknesses in primary
education to be a larger factor.

2.05      The decline in primary education standards during the 1970s
resulted from several factors: (a) during the middle of the decade expat-
riate managers and teachers were replaced by local staff, half of whom had
(in 1979) a level of schooling of less than grade 10; (b) an annual 10%
erosion of funds available per pupil to purchase textbooks ane 'eaching
materials; and (c) required teaching methods were frequently beyond the
capability of the newly appointed staff.
2.06      As a consequence of the low quality at the primary level, output
and quality suffered at upper levels. Quality standards in lower secondary
schools fell as teachers found it necessary to provide remedial work to
overcome primary deficiencies. Despite severe screening processes between
grades 8 and 9, achievement levels declined among those who completed grade 10
(Table 2.2).
2.07      In terms of numbers, no shortages of primary teachers are expected
in the 1980s but the Government recognizes that there are qualitative
shortcomings in teacher training, curricula, and materials. An initial
constructive step towards making better use of well-qualified teacher trainers
was taken in 1979 by consolidating all in-service teacher training at a former
preservice teacher training college, the Port 14oresby Inservice Teachers
College (POMITC). However, the institution is handicapped by the lack of
facilities, equipment and staff. It needs further development and expansion
to discharge adequately its new responsibilities. A new program of
residential in-service training was started two years ago. This program,
which is intended primarily for minimally trained teachers /1 is a good start,
but requires refinement to make it practical and relevant to the conditions
under which primary schools operate in rural areas. POMITC also operates
newly developed six-month and shorter courses for headmasters, which also
address the quality issue. These courses need continued review to ensure that
the actual problems encountered by headmasters are adequately covered. While
concentrating residential in-service training at POMITC is a constructive
step, more attention should be paid to recurrent in-service training in the
provinces to supplement the residential program and reach a larger audience.
The annual provincial teacher training weeks conducted between school terms
have been found to be less helpful than expected. POMITC should, as part of
its new responsiblity, revitalize and expand this program.
2.08      The Curriculum Development Center (CDC) of the Department of
Education has also received special attention in'recent years. The
professional staff has been expanded from 10 in 1974 to 25 in 1979 and the
organizational structure has been altered to place the entire unit under a
single administration and to improve its internal structure. However,
/1 About 600 teachers have been trained in the two years the consolidated
program has been in operation.



-8-
much remains to be accomplished in the CDC which is now scattered in three
locations around Port Moresby. Of particular importance are: (a)
coordinating curriculum and materials development with teacher training
through staff and facilities sharing, (b) developing curricula more relevant
to village life; and (c) expanding the availability of printed and other
simple teaching aids to pupils and teachers.
2.09      Language is closely associated with quality standards.  English is
the official language of instruction in the absence of a viable alternative.
It is, however, spoken in less than 3% of the homes. Other homes use one of
the estimated 700 local vernaculars.  Pidgin and to a lesser extent Hiri Motu
are widely used as lingua franca. In the minority of situations where it is
possible, teachers of children in the lower primary grades use local
vernacular as the language of instruction. Other teachers receive no
particular training in bridging language communication gaps which generally
exist between teachers and pupils. Special training programs in communication
skills for teachers need to be introduced at POMITC. Such programs would
help improve communications, but the language problem will remain a long-
term issue.
2.10      In summary, a comprehensive program is needed to improve educa-
tional standards. This program should focus on teacher training, textbooks
and examinations. Textbooks should be provided in all major areas and
distributed so that every child has access to them. Library books and
other teaching materials should be made available. Pre- and in-service
teacher training should be improved by introducing practical methods of
instruction, multi-grade teaching, language communication skills, school-
community relations and techniques of school and classroom management. The
emphasis of the examination program should be on testing children before the
end of grade 6 and oriented toward diagnosis of learning problems instead of
screening students for future education. Finally, education management should
place its main emphasis on improvement of teacher performance and student
learning achievement.
Enrollment Stagnation
2.11      During the immediate postwar period enrollment grew rapidly and
reached about 208,400 in 1970 or about 55% of the age group. Enrollment
has remained at about this ratio over the last decade. The overall
enrollment ratio was 58% in 1979, but five provinces (all in the Highlands)
remained at less than 50% while most New Guinea off-shore island provinces
were above 80%. During the 1970s enrollment increased only moderately to
277,500 in 1979 and enrollment ratios of the 1970s remained stagnant both
for grade 1 and for grades 1-6 as shown in Table 2.3./1 In 1978 the
Government announced its target of achieving universal (95%) enrollment in
/1 Complete provincial data are provided in Working Papers, Section B.



- 9 -
grades 1-6 by 1996.  Little can be done to achieve this target until the
causes of the enrollment stagnation have been removed.  The main causes have
been identified as:
(a) Educational. Children react to low quality with poor attendance
leading to dropout.
(b) Social and Economic. In the late 1960s the number of primary school
graduates grew rapidly and children, parents and community leaders
began to observe that grade 6 completion did not necessarily lead
to employment or entry into the monetized economy. Also, since
places in grade 7 are limited to only one-third of those who
finish grade 6, the temptation to drop out became great for those
students who knew they were behind their peers in their studies.
Enrollment of girls lagged behind that of boys at a rate of about
2:3 because parents keep girls at home to care for younger children
and other tasks. Many parents in the rural highland provinces do
not wish their daughters to be educated because of perceived nega-
tive effects on matrimonial eligibility of educated girls. Lack of
communications between parents and school is also a factor.
(c) Geographical - About 20% of the primary school-age population
resides too far from an existing school to enroll or attend.
Dropout in rural schools is also high.

2.12       Enrollment stagnation means that over 40% of primary school-age
children (203,000) are not receiving basic education. These children may be
divided into two categories: (a) those who live near an existing school and
are not enrolled; and (b) those who live beyond a reasonable travel distance
or time to an existing school. Estimates for each category were developed
by analyzing enrollment ratios for 1974-1979 as follows (Table 2.4):
(a) Eliminating dropout of once enrolled children would raise the
enrollment ratio from 58% to 68%.
(b) Enrolling girls at the same ratio as boys could further increase
enrollment in areas served by existing schools and bring the overall
ratio to 82%.
(c) The residual is composed of two groups: (i) those who live near,
but were never enrolled in, existing schools (estimated at 5%); and
(ii) those living outside the area of existing schools (estimated
at 10-15%).

2.13      Table 2.4 shows the effect of eliminating dropout and enrolling
girls at the same rate as boys. Hypothetically the overall enrollment ratio
would increase from 58% to 82% because of the 115,000 additional enrolled
children. This is a substantially larger group than the residual of 86,000
children most of whom are not enrolled because of lack of access. The
retention/enrollment of children who live within commuting distance of
existing schools is therefore of high priority.
2.14      Improved management, enhanced school-community relations /1 and
teaching methods sensitive to local languages and customs should assist in
attracting more children to enroll in grade 1. Improvements in education
quality should improve satisfaction of children and parents with the school
and contribute to reduced dropout. For those admitted to grade 7, improved
quality of primary education would help overcome the present low state of
readiness to benefit from secondary education.
2.15      A two-fold approach is needed to raise enrollment ratios above the
present 55-60% plateau towards the Government's 95% target by the end of the
century (and an interim 68% target by 1987). Existing schools can provide a
partial solution through: (a) improved teaching methods and parental guidance;
and (b) concentration on special programs to identify and enroll children,
especially girls, living within commuting distance of the school area.
Existing school locations could, with the addition of about 2,000 new
classrooms and teachers, and an increased pupil/teacher ratio from 31 to 35,
accommodate over 100,000 children and result in an enrollment ratio of about
80% without requiring children to travel excessive distances. New schools
would be required for the remaining 20% of the children who reside too far
from any existing school. Most new schools should be small and use multigrade
teaching and/or alternate year intake, but some of these schools should
eventually become complete six grade (six room) schools. School maps and
related data should be prepared and plans developed to determine the need for
expansion and establishment of new schools.
Financial Constraints
2.16      The PNG Government has for the past decade been faced with a
continued shortage of domestic revenue. Domestic revenues are typically
only about 60% of expenditures. Over 80% of this revenue deficit has been
covered by Australian aid; the remainder through other external assistance.
An increasingly self-reliant economy and reduced dependence on external aid is
a declared government policy,/2 and a 5% annual reduction in Australian aid
has become a working assumption of the Government. Accordingly, the Govern-
ment has limited the annual growth rate of public expenditure to 3% p.a.
/1  A dropout study concluded in September 1980 identifies lack of
school-community relations as a major cause of dropout and
non-enrollment.
/2 PNG Government White Paper, October 1976 (see NPEP 1980-83, paras. 2.3
and 2.7).



- 12 -
in most sectors, but as a priority sector, primary education will be allowed
a growth rate of 5%./1 At the provincial level there are also financial
constraints. Revenue-earning powers of most provinces are limited and
unconditional grants from the Central Government constitute the most
important source of funds. Provincial governments are, as a result, cautious
in introducing items likely to remain a long-term financial liability, such
as new teaching posts.
2.17       Unit Costs.  Unit costs of all levels of education, especially
post-primary are above world and Asian median (Table 2.5). Two factors in PNG
account for this difference: low teacher/pupil ratio and high primary teacher
salaries. Primary teachers in PNG teach fewer pupils and receive pay corres-
ponding to 11 times the GNP/capita despite the fact that about 25% are still
minimally trained. Additional causes of the high unit costs at post-primary
levels include:
(a) Secondary (Grades 7-10)
(i) use of expensive expatriate teachers (slightly under 30%);
(ii) continuation of residential programs at nearly all secondary
schools, (75% of students); and
(iii) the low tuition and boarding fees paid by students or parents;
(b) Post-secondary (beyond Grade 10)
(i)  use of expensive expatriate teachers;
(ii)  continuation of expensive residential programs for all
students; and
(iii)  the reluctance of National Government to require students or
parents to shoulder part of the recurrent costs either in the
form of moderate tuition or residential fees./2
/1  NPEP 1981-84 (draft).
/2  At UPNG neither tuition nor fees are charged.  In addition, students
are given a weekly personal spending allowance.

only a single figure for all post-primary education.
2.18      The high cost of education must be taken into account when
assessing the Government's ability to achieve its targets in primary
education:
(a) enrolling 68% of the age group by 1987 and over 90% by the end of
the century;
(b) improving primary level retention from current 70% to over 75%;
and
(b) raising standards of teaching and learning.
These goals can only be met if government plans to reduce costs are imple-
mented, e.g. by increasing the primary pupil/teacher ratio; and introducing
economies at the upper secondary and higher levels through localization of
staff, reduced boarding, and charging of tuition fees.

Government Plans
2.19      The National Public Expenditures Plan (NPEP) is the National
Government's chief instrument to direct incremental budgetary support (both
internal revenues and external aid) to priority sectors and to under-
privileged provinces. NPEP is a "rolling" plan, building on the existing
system of annual budget preparation, but with a four-year planning horizon.
It is reviewed and extended each year so that it always covers four years.
The current NPEP, 1980-83, is the third such plan. The NPEP has established
a set of criteria for resource allocation, a consistent procedure for the
evaluation of new expenditure proposals, and it exercises firm and
centralized control over public expenditure decisions.  A special feature of
the latest NPEP is allocations to selected sectors and subsectors of high
priority. Primary education is one of eleven such sectoral programs.
2.20      Under the sectoral program in primary education, the provinces
submit to the National Government their proposals for subprojects to improve



- 15 -
quality of and access to primary education. The first set of proposals was
submitted to the National Government in 1979 and included a varied collection
of capital and recurrent cost items, depending on perceived needs and
priorities in each province. Construction of new primary school buildings
and new teacher housing was, however, specifically excluded from the
proposals because this activity is a community responsibility. Evaluation
of the provincial proposals by the National Government has been difficult
because provincial strategies and targets have not been specified.
2.21      The primary education sectoral programs are expected to play an
increasingly important role in future years and to become the principal
instrument in reaching the Government's target of full enrollment by the end
of this century. The Government decided in 1978 to retain the size of
untied primary education grants to the provinces at K 30.0 million p.a. (in
real terms) and to funnel the annual 5% increment over the next eight years
through the sectoral program. Although the 1980 sectoral program is only
K 3.1 million (or 9% of total primary education program), this figure will by
1986 have increased to K 14.3 million (or 32% of the total) if the program
continues as planned. In view of the growing importance of the sectoral
programs, the need for preparing plans and strategies for these programs is
becoming increasingly important.
3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project would:  (a) help improve the management of
educational resources; (b) assist the National Department of Education (NDOE)
improve the quality of primary education; and (c) help provinces increase
quality of and access to primary education. The project strategy is divided
into these three broad headings.
Strategy
3.02      Educational Resources Management.  The proposed project would
assist in training educational administrators, planners and teachers to:
(a) make better use of human resources; (b) help implement the Government s
decentralization policy; (c) accelerate the introduction of indigenous staff
through appropriate training; and (d) retard the growth of recurrent costs
through a 15% increase in actual class size and systematic school location
planning.
3.03      Quality Improvement.  The proposed project would seek to reduce
dropout, from the current 30% to 25%; raise pupil learning achievements from
a score of 40-50% to about 60%; and improve teaching efficiency through a
multifaceted attack on low quality in primary education by:



- 16 -
(a) strengthening the Curriculum Development Center (CDC), by adding a
textbook development unit, an examination unit and an audio-visual
aids section;
(b) reinforcing the examination and evaluation process by providing
facilities and staff for continuous educational evaluation;
(c)  coordinating curricula with teacher training through relocation of
the CDC to a site adjacent to the national center for in-service
staff training; and
(d) improving facilities and staff quality at teacher training colleges
to help upgrade their teaching program and improve the performance
of less qualified instructional staff.
3.04      Enrollment Expansion.  The project would support the Government's
efforts to extend educational opportunities to hitherto underserved areas
and to expand existing schools to keep pace with continued population
growth. It would do so through a financial program, called the Provincial
Primary Education Fund ("the Provincial Fund"). The Provincial Fund would
finance a series of small projects designed to address expansion constraints
and quality issues in primary education. A feature of the Provincial Fund
(which is described in more detail in Chapter 4) is that it would support
both capital and recurrent costs, depending on the nature of enrollment
constraints faced by a particular province.
Project Components
3.05      Administration (Proposed outlay US$1.1 million, excluding contin-
gencies). The project would: (a) strengthen local planning and adminis-
trative capacity by financing local and overseas in-service training pro-
grams for educational administrators and planners; and (b) help prepare
provincial education plans. The largest training program would encompass
nearly all the senior administration and planning cadre of the nation: about
40 provincial and 10 national staff including the education superintendent
and the education planner from each province. The training content would
include case studies and practical exercises directly related to the
responsibilities of national and provincial staff. To avoid excessive
depletion of staff resources, local training would consist of a 15-month
program divided into multiple segments of 2 to 8 weeks duration covering the
span of the project, 1981-87./1 The residential training would be conducted
at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) in Port Moresby, and at POMITC,
which have staff capable of conducting such training. Four man years of
expert assistance would be provided under this component to supplement
existing training capacity. Overseas training would be provided in two ways:
/1 See Working Paper for details of staff to be trained and implementation
schedule of training.



- 17 -
(a)  Study tours of 10 weeks duration for 20 provincial superintendents
and about 10 selected NDOE staff. The study groups would go to
developing countries en route to more developed countries to study
education administration in different settings. Six to eight
wTeeks of predeparture and poststudy tour seminars would complement
this training.
(b)  Fellowships in educational planning of 12 months  duration would
be arranged for 5 NDOE staff and provincial superintendents. The
fellowship training would take place in 1982-84.
To supplement the training, the project would finance the services of four
experienced educational planners for a duration of about two years each to
assist the provinces in preparing provincial medium-range educational plans.
Short-term planners (one-month visits) would also be used. These planners
would be required in the early years of the project (1980-82).
3.06      Curriculum, Textbooks, Examinations and Testing (Proposed outlay
US$5.4 million excluding contingencies). A major objective of the proposed
project is to improve primary teaching materials. The curriculum, textbooks
and media, and examinations components of the proposed project would play a
major role in this respect. These components would support the development,
testing and production of appropriate teaching materials. The Curriculum
Unit (CDC) of the Standards Division would operate these components in
project-financed facilities on the site of the Port Moresby In-service
Teachers College (POMITC). The proposed project would provide office space
for CDC staff and editors, printshop, graphics and storage facilities for
small-scale textbook production; communal facilities for CDC staff; and a
small computer for statistical analysis of examination results.
3.07      The main objectives of the textbook program would be to develop
institutional capacity for continuous supply of textbooks relevant to Papua
New Guinea. This includes writing, production of trial editions, field
testing, revision, production and printing of final editions and
distribution to schools of textbooks and teachers- guides in grades 4-6 in
mathematics and community life (social studies and health)./l Language
differences in grades 1-3 (para. 2.09) make the development of satisfactory
textbooks in subjects other than English difficult. Current emphasis in
grades 1-3 is therefore on the English textbooks while the development of
textbooks in other subjects will be deferred. The textbooks would be field
tested in about ten representative schools to ensure readability,
/1 An adequately funded textbook program in English, the medium of
instruction, is ongoing. Science textbooks would not be developed
because a series of adequate booklets is already available.



-          ~~~- 18 -
practicability, adequacy of materials and acceptability in terms of local
customs and traditions. Teachers would be trained in the use of textbooks
concurrently with the textbook development phase. Inspectors would be
trained as trainers and their training of teachers reinforced with radio
broadcasts. Pre- and post-tests would be administered to pupils on a sample
basis to evaluate the effects of the text on pupil achievement.
3.08      Textbook printing within the Curriculum Unit would be limited to
production of the trial edition and possibly the teachers' guides. Com-
mercial printing facilities in PNG are limited and government printing
facilities lack trained personnel. A five-year training program (1978-83)
for the government printer in NWS is in progress and this is expected to
permit the Government printer to compete effectively with foreign firms for
textbook production in PNG. The number of recipients of textbooks and
guides is expected to fall within the ranges shown in Table 3.1.

Total                6,000-7,200                  150-216
Appropriate storage for books would be provided in the project to prolong
the life of the books. Based on experience in comparable countries, the
average life of each book is estimated at three years. The number of
textbooks and guides is estimated in Table 3.2.

The Supply Division of NWS would be in charge of distributing prepackaged
textbooks to the provinces where suitable storage depots exist. Distribution
of textbook packages to the schools would be a joint NWS/PDOE undertaking.
Training workshops for provincial supply officers in respect of organizing
intraprovincial distribution would be undertaken by the Supply Division of
NWS.
3.09      Three nondegree fellowships of six months each would be provided
to train local staff in curriculum development. Three man-months of overseas
in-plant training would be provided for composers in the printshop. Unesco-s
specialist services programs in textbook development and production are
expected to continue and would be strengthened under the proposed project
with 18 man-years of specialist services in community life, health,
mathematics, book production, graphics and editorial services.
3.10      CDC would expand and improve its development of simple audio-visual
aids such as wall charts and maps to complement improved textbooks. Staff
would be trained to instruct teachers in the use of diversified media.
Fellowships (48 man-months) would be provided in fundamentals of educational
technology, especially low cost technology to support the curriculum of PNG,
ways to interest teachers in the use and development of teaching media and
distribution and maintenance arrangements. To complement the fellowships
training, four man-years of specialist services would be provided in simple
educational technology and broadcasting.



- 20 -
3.11      The objective of the examination test and measurement component is
to improve the present weak examination programs, to assist in diagnosis of
learning and teaching problems and to produce meaningful results for student
placement. Close liaison would be established between the examination unit
and curriculum materials developers to improve designs of diagnostic tests
in textbooks and teachers' guides. Among the more specific outcomes
expected are: (a) development of appropriate measurement devices to use in
grades 4-5 to assist teachers to improve instruction, identify pupil
learning difficulties, and assess adequacy of curriculum and teaching
materials; (b) development of reliable and valid tests upon which decisions
regarding future education would be based; and (c) introduction of annual
collection and statistical analysis of test results as a means of trend
analysis of educational outcomes (para. 2.04). This information will
provide inputs for an overall project evaluation. Specialist services (six
man-years) and four degree fellowships for local staff are envisioned.
During negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would
gather on a sample basis test results from grades 4-6 and submit for Bank
Group review: (a) baseline data by December 31, 1982; and (b) annual
evaluation data on the impact of textbooks and curricula during 1984-87.
3.12      To assist in extending the use of learning materials and improved
teaching methods to schools in the provinces, the proposed project would
include fellowships and specialist services for two activities related to
quality improvements - school libraries and educational resource centers
(ERCs). Field surveys of school libraries would be conducted and lists of
suitable books for varying school sizes developed. Training courses for
library staff and teachers would also be conducted. ERCs are provincial
extension centers for teacher training, local curriculum development and
teaching materials production and lending. Interest of the provinces in
these activities is promising and the inclusion of technical assistance
would support provincial initiatives to design and operate such centers.
Seventy-two man-months of fellowships for librarians and 30 man-months for
ERC operators would be provided. Four man-years of specialist services for
libraries/ERCs would complement the fellowships training program.
3.13      Teacher Training.  (Proposed outlay US$2.3 million excluding con-
tingencies.) The objective of this project component is to convert, improve
and expand the physical facilities of POMITC and to train teaching staff in
the use of media. Special emphasis would be placed on linking teacher
training with textbook development. The POMITC facilities would be provided
with a well-equipped library, staff offices, workshops, audio-visual and
recreational facilities for students and staff; renovations of existing
communal facilities; and new hostel facilities for 80 students to make the
college fully residential. The renovated POMITC facilities would complement
the new, contiguous CDC facilities.
3.14      The following in-service training courses would be operated at
POMITC (Table 3.3):

3.15      The proposed project would assist in retarding the growth of
recurrent education costs by increasing the proportion of indigenous teach-
ers of all PNG's primary education teacher training colleges from the cur-
rent 28% to 50% (Table 3.4). The average annual cost per staff member would
be reduced by about 25% (from US$20,000 to US$15,000). At the end of the
project (1987) overall annual cost of teacher trainer salaries would be re-
duced from US$2.7 million to about US$2.1 million despite a 10% increase in
staff numbers (Working Paper Section C). The training of teacher trainers
(63 man-years) would be a combination of local/overseas and degree/nondegree
training. At least half of the program would be conducted by the UPNG as
two-year diploma courses. Six man-years of specialist services would be
provided to coordinate this training. A detailed fellowship and staff
training plan is shown in Working Papers, Section B../1
/1 The training plan would cover all training components of the project.

3.16       Provincial Primary Education Fund (Proposed size of Bank financing
US$7.5 million.) The objective of the "Provincial Fund" is to assist the
provinces in improving quality of and access to primary education. The
Provincial Fund would help accommodate more pupils in existing schools, open
new schools in hitherto underserved areas (paras. 2.11-2.13) and improve
education quality. This objective is similar to that of the Government's
sectoral programs in primary education (para. 2.20). Therefore, the
proposed project element would finance a share of the NPEP sectoral programs
in primary education during 1983-85 when provincial education plans have
been substantially completed (para. 3.05).
3.17       The Provincial Fund would finance a variety of items identified as
constraints to enrollment expansion or education quality in each province.
The national policy, under which financing construction of new schools is a
communal responsibility, would not be changed. Consequently the Provincial
Fund would finance other items, geared to expand enrollment (particularly
that of girls) or improve quality of primary education. These would
include:
(a) New teaching posts for new or enlarged schools;
(b) Materials needed to erect new schools or extend existing ones;
(c)  Materials for erecting or improving teacher housing at an existing
school where teacher posting has proven difficult, or in a
community which has provided a school but lacks teachers;
(d)  Equipment and materials for new or expanded schools (such as
blackboards, classroom furniture, books, storage areas, water
tanks, etc.).
(e) Experiments/studies to improve quality and access.



- 23 -
Over 50% of the items to be financed by the Provincial Fund are expected to
be incremental operating costs because the greatest constraint to increased
access is the provision of finances for new teaching posts (para. 2.16).
3.18      A national enrollment ratio target of 68% of the primary age
population has been established for the final year of the project, 1987
(para. 2.18). Taking the estimated population increase into account,
reaching this target would mean a 45% increase in enrollment, from 277,000
in 1979 to 400,000 in 1987. An important activity of the proposed project
would be to develop provincial education plans for the years 1983-87,
including detailed strategies and means needed to achieve the enrollment
targets. The contents of such plans would include:
(a) numbers and locations of children who now lack access to existing
schools;
(b) school maps to determine proper location of new schools to
serve those children;
(c) assessment of the ability of communities to erect necessary new
schools;
(d) identification of sociocultural constraints to enrollment expan-
sion and ways to overcome such constraints;
(e) analysis of the need for expansion of existing schools to
meet population and enrollment growth;
(f) staff needs for teachers, headmasters and inspectors; and
(g) development of annual priorities.
The National Government is assisting the provinces in formulating their
plans before the Provincial Fund becomes operational in 1983. During
negotiations the Government agreed to submit for Bank review by December 31,
1982 its consolidated plan for enrollment expansion by province or groups of
provinces during 1983-87.
3.19      Project Evaluation and Management (Proposed outlay US$1.8 mil-
lion). The Government is in the process of establishing a unit for
systematic formative and summative evaluation of the project. This unit
would become the core of a permanent management information system within
the NDOE. The unit would have four key staff, a coordinator, an evaluation
and dissemination officer, a provincial project liaison officer, and a
project staff development evaluation officer. Twenty man-years of
specialist services would be provided for initial staffing of the unit and
three degree fellowships (54 man-months) would complement the specialist



- 24 -
services program. A national advisory committee on evaluation would be
established to provide policy guidelines and set priorities in evaluation
activities. Project management would also be strengthened with ten
man-years of specialist services (project manager and project accountant).
3.20      Other Components.  (Proposed outlay US$0.8 million excluding
contingencies.) The project would include US$600,000 for twenty staff
houses for project specialists. The proposed project would also include
US$200,000 for preparation of future education projects including a special
intensive study of quantitative and qualitative problems of lower and upper
secondary education (estimated cost US$100,000). The study on secondary
education would provide recommendations on necessary national and provincial
policy and educational changes required to increase enrollment, reduce
wastage and improve educational attainment at that level (paras. 2.04 and
2.06). During negotiations the Government agreed to complete this study by
December 31, 1983.
4. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
4.01      The improvement program for primary education would consist of:
(a) identifiable national project items; and (b) funding assistance to a
series of provincial subprojects to be determined during project execution.
4.02      Management arrangements for execution of the project would rely
heavily on existing implementation organizations and include:
(a) comprehensive plans for administrative responsibilities, organiza-
tion and staffing;
(b) well-defined implementation procedures for subprojects financed
by the Provincial Fund;
(c) relevant criteria for use of the Provincial Fund; and
(d) a realistic implementation schedule.
These arrangements are discussed in the following sections of the report.
Administrative Responsibilities, Organization and Staffing
4.03      The project would be implemented by existing line agencies at
national and provincial levels and coordinated by staff in the Ministry of
Education (Chart 22239 on next page). At the national level, overall
responsibility for coordinated project implementation would rest with a
Project Management Committee (PMC), chaired by the Secretary of Education.

Committee members would be the Secretaries of Finance and National Department
of Works and Supply (NWS) (or their nominees). A similar committee exists
under the First Education Project, Credit 661-PNG. The PMC would be a
policy-implementing and decision-making body, responsible to the Budget
Priorities Committee.
4.04      The Assistant Secretary, Planning Services, in the National
Department of Education (NDOE), assisted by a project manager, procurement
officer, an accountant and a part-time senior architect from NWS,
would be the executive officer of the PMC and be responsible for overall
project implementation. Specifically, he would:
(a) coordinate activities of executive government departments and
agencies and ensure that the covenants and conditions of the
Loan/Credit Agreement are complied with;
(b) prepare staffing plans, including staff development plans;
(c) identify needs for technical assistance and arrange for the
necessary recruitment;
(d) arrange for preparation of designs and supervise the approved
capital works program;
(e)  arrange for implementation of the textbook program;
(f)  arrange for procurement of equipment and ensure that contracts are
awarded in accordance with Bank and Government guidelines;
(g)  arrange for preparation of project budgets;
(h)  monitor and control costs in accordance with the approved budgets;
(i) maintain records and accounts, prepare periodical progress
reports and liaise with the Bank;
(j) prepare and submit disbursement applications to the Bank; and
(k) monitor and evaluate progress and conduct project studies.
NDOE would also (together with NPO and the Finance Department) ensure
that the Provincial Fund would be used in accordance with implementation
procedures mutually agreed between the Bank and the Government.
4.05      Appropriate sketch designs for the joint POMITC and CDC campus
have been prepared by the architectural division of NWS. The working
drawing stage will include the assistance of engineering design consultants



- 27 -
who are available in the country. Tender documents for this complex would be
prepared by the Quantity Surveying Division of NWS.  Supervision would be
done jointly by the two divisions. The existing site of POMITC, the only
identifiable project site at this stage, is adequate in size and
appropriately located for the POMITC/CDC complex.
4.06       The Local Government Design Services branch of NWS would be
strengthened with two man-years of specialist services. The specialist
would assist in extending existing low-cost school construction technology
to communities interested in making use of this technology for their primary
school construction programs.
Provincial Fund Implementation Procedures
4.07       The Provincial Fund is defined as the Bank financing of the
Community Education Sectoral Program of the NPEP. The Provincial Fund would
be limited to financing programs in provincial primary education during
1983, 1984 and 1985, the incremental cost of which has been estimated at
US$16.1 million over the 1981 allocation./l The National Planning Committee
(NPC) determines an overall ceiling on the NPEP sectoral budget for primary
education each year, whereas a'llocation of funds to the provinces, project
appraisal and supervision is the responsibility of NDOE. Responsibility for
identification and implementation of provincial subprojects rests with the
provinces. An agreement between provincial and national governments
outlining duties and responsibilities of the two parties would be a
prerequisite for disbursements of NPEP funds to provinces.
4.08      National Responsibilities.  NDOE would be responsible for the
following in respect of the Provincial Fund:
Annually
(a) propose to NPC the sectoral allocations to each province in
accordance with a set of social equity indicators (population and
enrollment ratios), and inform the provinces accordingly;
/1  This estimate is based on the following assumptions and definitions:
(a) sectoral programs in primary education would grow at an annual rate
of 5% of the total education budget; (b) 65% of that amount would be
allocated to provincial projects; and (c) only the increments in 1983
over the 1981 budget (starting year of the project) would be defined as
project cost. For disbursements purposes, the total NPEP allocation for
provincial projects during 1983 (US$30.7 million as shown in the NPEP)
would be used as a basis for calculations. For further details of
calculations see Working Papers, Section E.



- 28 -
(b)  provide technical assistance to help provinces formulate their own
draft project proposals within their allocations;
(c) review provincial project proposals and advise provinces on
technical suitability (including staff requirements/constraints)
of their proposals;
(d) check if individual provincial subproject proposals meet agreed
criteria and policy directives;
(e) obtain cash flow and implementation schedules for each provincial
NPEP primary education subproject;
(f) submit for budget approval, consolidated provincial proposals for
NPEP primary education projects to the Budget Priorities
Committee, NPC and the National Executive Council;
(g) evaluate the impact of each subproject towards stated targets,
Quarterly
(h) disburse, or cause to be disbursed, the estimated next three-month
requirement of NPEP funds to the provinces;
(i)  prepare financial and physical performance reports on the
provinces which would be used for processing of withdrawal
requests to the Bank Group; and
(j) submit quarterly reports on expenditure and physical progress
through the Government-s regular quarterly review progress for
the budget and the NPEP.
4.09      The National Planning Office (NPO) would monitor overall implemen-
tation progress through the quarterly reports submitted by the NDOE and its
own inspections of provincial physical progress in order to keep the
National Planning Committee informed about progress on a quarterly basis.
The Budget Priorities Committee would act as an arbiter between national and
provincial education authorities in cases of disagreement over conformity of
provincial project proposals with agreed criteria and policy directives.
4.10      The National Department of Works and Supply (NWS) would physically
monitor all NPEP.capital works projects through their provincial offices.
In addition, the NWS would be responsible for financial monitoring of
capital works undertaken on behalf of the provinces by N1S' own work force.



- 29 -
4.11      Provincial Responsibilities.  The PDOEs in consultation with
provincial governments would be responsible for preparing the medium-range
plans for increasing access to primary education (para. 3.18). Technical
assistance would be provided by the National Government to assist the
provinces in preparing their own plans (para. 3.05); alternatively a
province could request NDOE to prepare such a plan on its behalf. Annual
NPEP project proposals, prepared by the same parties would: (a) dovetail
with the medium-range provincial plan; (b) be within the financial limits of
the sectoral programs in each province; (c) respond to established national
criteria; and (d) accord with provincial priorities. Over the span of the
project there would be about 60 provincial Bank-financed subprojects (e.g.,
one per year by each province (20) during the 1983-85 period). Each
subproject is estimated to consist of about 5 project items, i.e., there
would be a total of about 300 project items to be financed by the Provincial
Fund. During negotiations the Government agreed that: (i) prior to the
first year of Provincial Fund operations (1983) it would send for Bank reviewe
and comments a representative subproject from each Region; and (ii) in
subsequent years it would submit to the Bank Group for review and comments
such other subprojects as the Bank would reasonably request.
Criteria for Use of the Provincial Fund
4.12      During the first year of NPEP sectoral operations (1980), primary
education projects in the provinces were identified in accordance with
loosely defined criteria.  Improved project criteria have been prepared in
cooperation with the Government (Annex 2) and would be followed during the
1983-85 budget periods when the NPEP sectoral projects would be financed
with the Provincial Fund. The criteria consist of general guidelines for
allocation of funds and approval criteria of provincial projects. These
criteria would ensure that assistance provided under the Provincial Fund
would direct provincial primary education projects towards their objectives:
improved access to, and quality of, primary education. During negotiations
the Government provided assurances that it would: (a) allocate sectoral
program funds to the provinces in accordance with agreed distribution
criteria; and (b) review Provincial Fund-assisted subprojects in conformity
with agreed criteria.
4.13      Guidelines for Allocation of NPEP Funds.  About two thirds of the
yearly financial allocations for sectoral projects in primary education is
currently earmarked for provincially administered and one third for
nationally administered projects. These proportions are appropriate in view
of existing national and provincial responsibilities in the sector.
4.14      All provinces would receive a portion of the provincial allocation
of the NPEP for primary education, but interprovincial differentiation is
steeply pitched in favor of the disadvantaged provinces (e.g., the Eastern
Highlands Province received about 17 times as much NPEP Funds in 1980 as did



- 30 -
East New Britain). Criteria for determining allocations to each province
will be based on a recently revised (September 1980) index of provincial
population and primary enrollment ratio. Preparation of a medium-term plan
for increased access to primary education (para. 3.18) would be a new
criterion for any increase in a provinc.e's annual allocation of NPEP funds.
4.15      Approval of Provincial Projects.  The NDOE would review and
approve subprojects on the basis of their relevance, feasibility and
efficiency. The first criterion, relevance, would mean the degree to which
the subproject encourages primary enrollment improvement. Subprojects
financed by the Fund would therefore need to:
(a) support a component of primary education;
(b) support the provincial education plan to increase access and
reduce dropout of primary school children; or
(c) be designed to make a measurable contribution to increasing
subject matter relevance and improving provincial education
delivery methods and means.
4.16      The second criterion, feasibility, would mean the ability of the
province to undertake and support a project on a continuous basis. A
project proposal would need to be documented in accordance with NPO
guidelines to prove its feasibility./I Topics that would be reviewed
include: (a) suitability of school location; (b) availability of staff; (c)
availability of school facilities and staff housing; and (d) recurrent cost
implications and ability of the province to sustain these expenditures upon
project completion.
4.17      The third criterion, efficiency, would include such aspects as the
reasonableness of investment and recurrent costs, and attention to
appropriate class and school sizes. Annex 2 provides further explanation of
the criteria guiding allocations of the Provincial Fund.
Implementation Schedule
4.18      The project would be implemented over a seven-year period as shown
in the implementation schedule (Annex 3). Major preparatory activities are
in progress and the Government has completed the 'following:
/1 See "Instructions and Guidelines for New Policy Submissions for the
National Public Expenditure Plan," National Planning Office, Feb. 1979.



- 31 -
(a) sketch plans, equipment lists and specifications;
(b) plan and schedule for textbook development and production;
(c) initial recruitment of technical assistance;
(d) final plans for project evaluation, tests and measurements;
(e) initial provincial plans and criteria for use of the Fund; and
(f) final plans for project management.
Of special importance in the initial project phase is the date for prepar-
ation of provincial plans for universal primary education (December 31,
1982), which links the use of the Provincial Fund in 1983-85 to specific
provincial targets. Evaluation of the provincial enrollment plans would be
conducted continuously throughout the project. The last project item - the
fellowships training program - would be completed by June 1987. The Closing
Date would be December 31, 1987.
5. COSTS AND FINANCING
Costs
5.01       Project costs are defined as the sum of:  (a) the costs of identi-
fiable project items (US$16.9 million including contingencies); (b) the
estimated incremental cost over the 1981 allocation of NPEP sectoral projects
in provincial primary education during the 1983-85 period (the Provincial
Fund),/1 US$16.1 million; and (c) the estimated cost of school construction
financed by local communities during the 1981-83 period (US$4.7 million) as
a matching contribution to the Provincial Fund. These costs are summarized
in Table 5.1 below.

5.03      Bases of Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to December 1980 prices.
Construction costs for CDC and POMITC have been estimated on the basis of
sketch plans of economical buildings. The plans were reviewed during
appraisal and found acceptable. The average building unit costs for these
facilities derived from recently built simple comparable structures in PNG
are estimated at US$375/sq m. Although local materials (timber, sand and
gravel) are used to the extent possible, unit cost is higher than in other
countries in the region because of high cost of imported materials (over 60%
of building materials are imported) and high cost of labor. Costs of
primary schools built by the communities have been provisionally estimated
at US$150/sq m. This figure represents an estimate of a wide range of unit
prices - from practically zero, where schools are built with donated labor
and bush materials - to over US$300/sq m where communities finance the
construction of permanent structures on remote locations. The cost of
specialist services, US$4,400/man-month is based on the average cost of
recent contracts in PNG for comparable services. This cost includes net
salaries, housing costs, education and medical benefits, moving allowances
and international airfares. Overhead costs for recruitment, local travel
costs and office costs are excluded from this man-month cost. Overseas
training costs have been estimated at US$18,000/man-year.
5.04      Comparisons of areas per student place with other Bank-financed
facilities can only be made for POMITC hostels and staff houses because
other facilities are either extensions of existing facilities or nonteaching
facilities (e.g. the CDC).  Such a comparison shows that the area per
boarding place at POMITC (10.4 m2) is the same as Bank median in FY74-77.
Staff houses are about 80 m2/house, 20% less than Bank median of
100 m/ouse.
5.05      Contingency allowances in project cost estimates are as follows:
(a) physical contingencies (US$1.1 million) estimated at 7% of the
base cost of all project items; and
(b) price contingencies (US$4.3 million) calculated on the December 1980
base cost plus physical contingencies in accordance with the
following estimates of price escalation (Table 5.3):

1983-5             7%
1986-7             6%
The Provincial Fund would finance sectoral programs with built-in
contingency allowances.
5.06       The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$18.0 mil-
lion or about 48% of total project costs. This foreign exchange component
was derived from an analysis of labor, materials and overhead contents of
civil works and furniture; estimation of the amount of imported equipment;
estimation of the foreign content of technical assistance; and an
approximation of the composition of the subprojects to be financed under the
Fund. The resultant percentages amount to 33% for civil works and
furniture; 91% for equipment; 90% for foreign technical assistance; 20% for
local training and professional services; and 30% for the Fund.
5.07      Duties and Taxes.  The local customs duties and taxes on civil
works and locally procured furniture and equipment is estimated at about
US$0.4 million or about 4% of the estimated cost of these items including
contingencies. No customs duties are levied on items directly imported for
project use.
Project Financing
5.08      The total project cost of US$37.7 million would be financed as

Incremental Recurrent Costs
5.09      Aggregate recurrent costs for primary education would increase
during the project period due to school-age population growth and higher
enrollment ratios (paras. 2.16-2.19) as shown in Table 5.5. Analysis of
the cost increases has been conducted in order to estimate the impact and

to suggest means to control increases in costs. Results of the analysis are
as follows:
-  if primary class size is increased from 31 to 35 by 1987 and held at
35 until the end of this century (para. 2.18) (Line 4); and
-  if the rate of primary teacher salary increases during the remainder
of the century are held below the growth rate of the 1970s (para.
2.18) (Line 5); and
- if primary expenditure is increased as a percent of total educational
expenditure from 39% to 56% (Line 10) in conformity with the
Government's declared education strategy./l
Education expenditures could be held near their present level of 5.4% of GNP
(Line 9).
Procurement
5.10      The main civil works contract(s) at POMITC/CDC (a US$3.0 million
package of three contracts) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Civil works
contracts estimated to cost US$300,000 or less, all furniture contracts and
contracts for goods to be financed through the Provincial Fund would be
awarded on the basis of government procedures acceptable to the Bank Group.
These procedures include locally advertised bidding and force account.
These procedures are appropriate in view of the large number of geograph-
ically dispersed small contracts that would be financed in this fashion
(para. 4.12). Prior Bank review of contract award would only be required
in the case of civil works contract(s) awarded under ICB.
5.11      Equipment, paper and materials bid packages over US$100,000
equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Domestic manufacturers would be

rate of increase would be reduced by more use of local teachers, reduc-
tion of boarding and other economies. See also National Education
Strategy 1979 pages 134-135 for planned changes in proportions allocated
to various levels of education.

allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the existing customs duty, whichever
is the lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports. Equipment, paper
and furniture purchases which cannot be reasonably grouped to form packages
in excess of US$100,000 equivalent could be made without prior Bank Group
approval on the basis of: (a) contract awards following compet'tive bidding
advertised locally; or (b) from existing government stores contracts,
provided that the aggregate of such contracts would be less than US$1,300,000.
Small-scale printing facilities (US$250,000) would be procured after
negotiations with a supplier that provides maintenance in PNG. Books (total
cost estimated at US$300,000) would be purchased directly from authorized
distributors. Printing of textbooks subject to a maximum of US$250,000
could be done by force account through the Government Printer. In addition,
miscellaneous items, not exceeding US$10,000 in each contract and aggregating
less than US$250,000 could be purchased on the basis of a minimum of three
price quotations.
Disbursements
5.12      Disbursements under the proposed project would be made as follows:
(a)  70% of local expenditures on civil works at POMITC/CDC and for
staff housing;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment,
furniture, paper, books and materials; 100% of ex-factory costs of
locally manufactured goods; and 70% of local expenditures for
goods and services procured locally;
(c)  100% of the cost of technical assistance (including civil works
designers), but excluding cost of their housing and recruitment;
(d)  the following percentages of local expenditures incurred in
respect of the NPEP sectoral programs for provincial primary
education during the following caledar years:/l
30% in 1983;
25% in 1984; and
20% in 1985 /2
Disbursement is expected to be completed by December 31, 1987. The estimated
schedule of disbursements is shown in the following table:
/1 For definition, see para. 4.07.
/2 To be adjusted during project implementation. The percentages have
been selected to allow the size of Bank/IDA financing to remain stable
at about US$2.5 million per year.

5.13      Documentation, Accounts and Audits.  Disbursements against expen-
ditures incurred for the Provincial Fund would be made on the basis of a
consolidated summary of quarterly statements of expenditure prepared by each
province. Disbursement against various other small local expenditures,
each less than US$1,000 and aggregating less than US$500,000 could also be
made against statements of expenditures.  Disbursement against remaining
project expenditures would be made against full documentation. All agencies
involved in project implementation would prepare and maintain separate
accounts for the project in accordance with sound accounting practices.
Such accounts, together with disbursement documents would be audited
annually by the Government according to standard government procedures.
During negotiations the Government provided assurances that:



- 41 -
(a) project accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting
procedures; and (b) national and provincial auditing procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank Group would be applied annually during
implementation.
6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The basic justification for the project is twofold:  (a) it would
improve literacy and numeracy; and (b) it would foster institution building
in the sector. Studies in other countries, including the Bank's own studies
of basic needs, show that prevalence of literacy and numeracy, particularly
among females, improves health and nutrition standards, increases agricul-
tural productivity and generates acceptance of population control measures.
An ongoing study of girls underenrollment in Papua New Guinea would
identify constraints in this respect and propose remedial strategies to be
supported by the project. As a result of this study and other project
strategies, overall gross enrollment ratios are expected to increase from
58% to 68% at the end of the project period. The increase would consist of
(i) decreased dropout (about 2% of total); (ii) increased participation of
girls (5% of total); and (iii) improved access (3% of total).
6.02      The proposed project would assist in improving education quality
by supplying over 150,000 children with textbooks and other instructional
material specifically designed for their needs. In-service teacher training
would annually upgrade about 430 poorly qualified teachers and headmasters.
The teachers would study relevant teaching practices and their knowledge of
primary school subjects would improve. Efficiency of the system would
improve through increased class size (from an average of 31 to 35) and
reduction in dropout (from 30% to 25%).
6.03      The proposed project would promote institution building through
administrative staff development and institutional enrichment. Ten national
headquarters staff, 40 provincial educational managers, 100 inspectors and
over 2,000 headmasters would receive administrative training during the
project period. In-service teacher training and curriculum development would
be consolidated on one campus to encourage continuous interaction between
teachers and developers of curricula. This combination would promote
relevancy of curricula, improve teacher understanding of curricular objectives
and ultimately benefit the students. The proposed project would support the
Government-s decentralization policy by helping improve institutional
capacity in the provinces through training of administrative staff from the
20 provincial education headquarters. A permanent evaluation unit would be
created and systematic school mapping would precede the preparation of
provincial education plans with specific enrollment targets and criteria for
preparing project-financed subprojects. These measures would support the
Government s target of providing universal primary education by the end of
this century.



- 42 -
Risks
6.04      Implementation.  The project faces an implementation risk in respect
of assistance to the provinces through the Provincial Fund. The sectoral
programs, which the Provincial Fund would support, have only been in operation
for a year, and evaluation of the provincial proposals for financing a variety
of capital and recurrent costs has proven difficult because provincial
strategies and targets have not been specified (paras. 2.20-2.21). There is a
risk that items selected for funding assistance by the provinces, would not be
high priority items in terms of project objectives: namely expansion and
improvement of primary education. To reduce this risk, implementation plans
for the years 1983-87, including detailed strategies and means to achieve
enrollment targets, would be prepared. Technical assistance would be provided
under the project to strengthen implementation capacity in this respect.
Assurances obtained from the Government during negotiations about the
completion of provincial education plans by December 31, 1982.
6.05      Fellowships.  Selection and release of about 65 individuals for
about 1,900 man-months of fellowship training will be difficult for two
reasons: lack of candidates and problems of operating units during absence of
fellows. The project includes two specific elements to overcome this risk:
(a) the project duration has been extended to seven years to permit the
fellowship program to be extended over a feasible period; and (b) specialist
services have been provided on a large scale to complement the fellowship
program.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations on
the following principal points:
(a) gathering and submission of data for evaluation of impact of
textbook and curricula (para. 3.11);
(b) that provincial plans for expansion of primary education would be
prepared (para. 3.18);
(c)  that a study of secondary education would be prepared (para. 3.20);
(d) (i) during Fund operations a representative subproject from each
Region would be sent for Bank review and (ii) the Bank's comments
would be taken into account during government review of subprojects
(para. 4.11);



- 43 -
(e) (i) funds for Provincial Fund-assisted subprojects would be
allocated among provinces in accordance with agreed criteria; and
(ii) the Government would review and approve Provincial
Fund-assisted subprojects in accordance with agreed criteria
(para. 4.12); and
(f) that accounts would be maintained according to sound procedures
and that auditing practices acceptable to the Bank would be
used (para. 5.13).
7.02      Subject to the above conditions the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a US$12.0 million credit on standard IDA terms and
a US$6.0 million loan to the Government of Papua New Guinea with a term of
20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

PROVINCIAL PRfIARY EDUCATION FUNTD
Eligibility Criteria
1.        All provinces in Papua Mbw Guinea would receive a share of the
sectoral allocations for primary education. Project-financed increments to
the sectoral allocations would be contingent upon completion of plans to
improve access and quality in each province or group of provinces (para.
3.18). To be eligible for financing through the Provincial Fund, annual
submissions of provincial subprojects in 1983-85 would have to accord with the
contents of such plans in terms of:
(a) school location planning;
(b) redressal of quality problems;
(c) sociocultural constraints;
(d) analysis of need for facilities and staff;
(e) feasibility of implementation; and
(f) annual priorities.
Interprovincial Spread
2.        A formula would be used for determining annual allocations among the
provinces based on a unit grant per enrolled pupil and a disadvantage index
derived from current enrollment ratios in each province. The most disadvan-
taged province would receive six times more per pupil than the least
disadvantaged province.

General Guidelines for Allocation of Funds
3.        Objectives.  The objective of the Provincial Fund is to assist the
provinces in improving quality of and access to primary education. The
Provincial Fund would finance a variety of items identified as constraints in
this respect in each province. Particular attention would be given to pro-
viding linkages between Fund-financed items and the provincial plans (para.
3.18).

ANNEX 2
Page 3
4.        Items Eligible for Financing.  Items eligible for financing are
expected to fall within the following categories:
(a)  new teaching posts for new or enlarged schools where student/
teacher ratios are higher than 40:1;
(b)  building materials needed to erect a new school or to extend
an existing one, provided that the recipient communities are
prepared to provide labor to erect the schools;
(c) provision of materials to erect teachers' houses where:
(i) turnover rate of teachers over the past five years has been
100% during every two-year (or shorter) period; and (ii) departing
teachers have consistently referred to lack of housing as a
reason for leaving;
(d) provision of teaching materials, such as blackboards, textbooks,
and library books where such material is available at rates less
than: (i) one blackboard/classroom; (ii) one textbook/pupil and
subject; and (iii) one library book per two children;
(e) provision of items designed to improve school amenities, such as
water tanks, piping material, septic tanks, etc., where such
material is needed to provide basic health standards;
(f) provision of staff and facilities for projects and studies
designed to improve primary teacher qualifications, provincial
curriculum contents and primary enrollment ratios.
Guidelines for Evaluation and Approval of Subprojects
5.        The NDOE will appraise annual NPEP submissions from the provinces
on the basis of three criteria: relevance, feasibility and efficiency.
These criteria should form the basis on which any evaluating or appraising
group will arrive at a consensus, although it is recognized that the weight
assigned to individual factors may vary. Detailed consideration of criteria
is expected to include factors such as:
A.  Relevance of Subproject to Provincial Plan Objectives
6.        Subproject applications would be evaluated to determine the degree
to which they would meet overall program objectives of enrollment expansion
and quality improvement. Particular care would be taken to ensure that a
close fit exists between targets or programs proposed and the causes of
problems identified in the provincial plans. The analysis of relevance
would include topics such as:
(a) Enrollments. Whether projected rates of enrollment are consistent
with targets stated in the provincial plans;

ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b)  Staffing.  Whether posting of new staff is consistent with
geographical areas of under enrollment and high student/teacher
ratios and whether qualifications of staff hired to improve
quality standards is commensurate with proposed tasks; and
(c)  School Location.  Whether location of new schools is selected with
the objective of reducing children's daily travel time to less
than two hours.
B. Feasibility of the Proposed Subproject
7.        The feasibility of the subproject, or the degree to which the
subproject could in fact be implemented, would be an important appraisal
consideration. This criterion would be separated into considerations related
to staffing, management, finance and physical feasibility.
(a)  Staffing.  Whether consideration has been given to providing
staff and to providing teachers with access to housing and other
basic amenities;
(b)  Management.  Whether the provinces have the manpower capability
to implement a subproject, and whether a subproject addresses a
sociocultural constraint;
(c)  Finance.  Whether the provinces are willing to sustain on a
long-term basis the recurrent costs generated by a subproject;
(d)  Physical.  Whether the communities are prepared to provide
school buildings (and teacher housing) as matching contribution
to salaries of new teaching posts.
C. Efficiency of Proposed Subproject
8.        The third general appraisal criterion would assess whether the
subproject could be implemented at reasonable cost. This consideration would
include the following aspects:
9.        Unit Capital Costs.  Whether the investment and recurrent cost per
student and per graduate would be reasonable and whether the cost of quality
improvement projects is justified in terms of expected results.
10.       Unit Size.  Whether consideration has been given to promoting
appropriate school and class sizes through multiple class teaching,
alternate year intakes, etc.
