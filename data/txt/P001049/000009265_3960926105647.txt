MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEFWATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A NATIONAL SEEDS PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 7.1 million (US$9.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would assist in financing a
project to establish a national improved seed production system.
2.        Background.  Agriculture is the most significant sector in
Guinea's economy, accounting for about 43% of GDP and employing about 80%
of the labor force. Although land and climate are not limiting factors to
increased agricultural production, the sector is not realizing its full
potential. Agricultural commodities, while accounting for the bulk of
Guinea's exports in 1958 (58%), now represent less than 2% of the total
value of exports. Rice imports, which were 7,000 tons in 1958, exceeded
100,000 tons in 1986. Failure to develop the sector stemmed from distorted
macroeconomic conditions, inadequate sector policies and services,
including research and extension, and lack of inputs. This resulted in a
low le-el of technology being practiced by farmers. Within this
environment, the efforts to select and produce good quality seed did not
have any tangible impact in terms of varieties produced and accepted, and
the amount of improved seed commercially distributed.
3.        In consultation with the Bank and the IMP, the Government of
Guinea in 1984 began to redress the basic macroeconomic problems with an
IDA-supported structural adjustment program which includes market
liberalization and removal of exchange rate and price distortions. It also
undertook the restructuring and divestiture of many public sector
enterprises, the reform of the public administration, and the establishment
of better public investment programs. The revamping of the relative price
structure has resulted in production incentives which correspond more
closely to Guinea's comparative advantage. In addition, removal of
official impediments to the free marketing of agricultural produce has
stimulated development of domestic agricultural markets. Expected
improvements in the road network will further stimulate agricultural
production. The Government now intends to reform basic agricultural
institutiors and services through measures which would reinforce research
and extension, and other specialized agricultural services which would
sustain the supply response stimulated by a more favorable policy
environment.
4.        Since independence, Guinea has expended considerable effort to
seLect and produce improved foodcrop varieties. Numerous varieties have



- 2 -
been introduced, tested and disseminated. Although some have deteriorated
considerably, many could be recovered, physically improved and re-released.
The combined production of improved conditioned seed in Guinea (about 350
tons/year) reaches only a fraction of the farmers. All efforts in seed
selection and production have lacked the key elements for success: clear
objectives, continuity of effort, concentration of available resources in
the most viable seed production areas and, most importantly, an adequate
organizational structure. Nevertheless, the potential exists for the rapid
provision of good quality, physically improved seed of the best varieties
already available, and for the selection and production of addi$onal
improved varieties in the near future. To achieve this, a catalytic
investment is required to fill certain voids and coordinate existing
eff4rts. This need has already been recognized by the Government and would
be addressjd under the proposed National Seeds project.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would draw
together the diverse activities in varietal selection and seed production
into a focused effort. It forms an integral part of the Government's and
IDA's strategies for the sector by addressing the identified need for
developing an improved eeed production capacity which, with minimum risk,
would improve the income of smallholders in that it would provide seeds
adapted to Guinea's varied ecological and economic environments. It would
complement and build on ongoing research, extension and seed production
activities financed by IDA and other donors, and capitalize on the existing
human and institutional infrastructure and on the genetic material
available. IDA's participation at this stage would fill a void in existing
projects by providing an overall national system which would help to
coordinate donors' efforts and ensure the supply of an essential input for
extension messages. Furthermore, the project would be in line with the
Government's and IDA's development strategy because important parts of the
seed production and distribution system would be privatized in the future.
6.        Project Objectives.  The main project objectives would be to (a)
supply the financing, the management assistance, and the organization to
establish a reliable national seed production system which would be
conducive to privatization; and (b) increase agricultural productivity
through the production of improved rice, maize and groundnuts seed. Under
the project, an important part of the seed production system (multi-
plication) would be contracted to farmers. Production of base seed and
quality control would be initially under state control. The operations of
Seed Conditioning Centers (SCCs) would be organized to facilitate their
privatization by establishing appropriate pricing mechanisms, cost control,
and incentives for good management.
7.        Project Description.  The project would, over a four-year period
(1988-91), set up the first national improved seed production system in
Guinea. It would build on existing institutions (research stations,
agricultural and regional development and extension projects) to identify,
produce and distribute improved rice, maize and groundnuts seed. This



- 3 -
would be implemented by (a) strengthening research stations to identify,
select and produce base seed of adapted varieties of foodcrops; (b) setting
up SCCs to supervise base seed production and its multiplication by
contract outgrowers, and to condition the improved seed for sale to farmers
and commercial suppliers; (c) establishing quality control facilities; (d)
training staff to carry out varietal selection and base seed production,
and to undertake auality cor.trol activities; and (e) providing the
organization which would ensure the control and coordination of countrywide
seed production activities. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$10.6 million equivalent, of which US$8.6 million (81Z) in foreign
exchange. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement. as well as the
disbursement schedule, are presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Guinea
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps showing project
locations are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6918-GUI dated
16 November 1987 is being distributed separately. A Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) has been awarded to ensure timely start-up of project
implementation and early selection of the varieties that would enter the
multiplication cycle.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) Government would do its utmost to sell the SCCs to the private
sector beginning upon their establishment (expectations are, however, that
the pri-ate sector will not purchase the centers until they are running
smoothly and generating profit, which will require several years); (b)
formalities to establish the SCCs would be completed by DecemDer 1988; (c)
proceeds of seed sale would be retained by the SCCs to ensure their
adequate furotioning and to establish conditions for future privatization;
(d) the National Seed Committee (NSC) in consultation with IDA and the
Regional Seed Committees would establish, at least on an annual basis, the
structure of seed prices for publicly owned SCCs and for contract
outgrowers to ensure adequate prefitability of both; and (e) Government
would ensure that an annual review of seed marketing and pricing is carried
out to determine seed price for publicly owned SCCs. Conditions of
effectiveness would be that (a) adequate land has been made available to
the SCCs; (b) a local currency Project Account has been Gpened with an
initial deposit by the Government of FG 80 million; (c) technical
specialists have been recruited; and td) the NSC has been established with
membership satisfactory to IDA.
9.        Benefits.  The project would provide the assistance and the
organization necessary for reliable production and distribution of improved
seed. Because improved seed at full development would cover about 20Z of
the area planted in Guinea with rice, maize and groundauts, crop
productivity would increase by 20-30Z. Additionally, the SCCs would
generate revenues from PY3 onwards, and the system has been set up in such
a way that it can be privatized a few years after start-up. Finally, the
project would train local staff to take over responsibility for base and
improved seed production and quality control. The Economic Rate of Return



-4-
is 3O2 and is relatively insensitive to likely variation in cests or
benefits from that predicted.
10.       Risks.  Two possible risks are (a) delays or complications in
project implementation due particularly to the need to coordinate several
institutions involved in the project; and (b) inadequate Government
counterpart funding. Delays will be minimized because the project has
already started up under PPF financing. Coordination among the various
institutions will be facilitated by the eagerness wvit which the entire
agricultural community is awaiting improved seeds, and by specific
coordination measures included in the project. The research centers are
looking forward to collaborating with the ptoject, which will assist them
technically and financially in exploiting available research results and
producing the base seed. In addition, the ongoing rural development
projects need improved seed to sz:pply their farmers. Furthermore, a
management unit and a consultative process (NSC) are provided to direct
project activities. Regarding timely Government counterpart funding, risks
have been lowered by reducing Government's finanurial contribution to a
minimum, by creating a revolving fund in which Government's contribution
would be provided in advance, and by ensuring that revenues from seed sales
would be kept in a bank account for the project's use.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
