                                         of
        Rondonia Natural Resources              Management Project
                         (Loan No. 3444-BR)

Introduction
1.     The WorldBank("Bank")approvedthe Loanto              supportthe Rondonia
Natural Resources Management            Project-known as PLANAFLORO-in
March1992. Implementationofthe socialand environmentalcomponentsof a
series   of    Bank-financed projects           of   the    1980s-known      as
POLONOROESTE-had             been       neither adequate nor       implemented.
PLANAFLORO,intendedto          redressthis failure, was designedin   accordance
with Bank strengthenedenvironmentaland           social policies and procedures
introducedin the late 1980s/early1990s.      TheStaffAppraisalReport("SAR")
and President's Memorandumfor            PLANAFLOROconvey Management's
belief that investmentsinthe environmentcould pay         off in economicterms.
Thiswas meant to be a   showcaseprojectfor a new         era in Bank lendingfor
sustainabledevelopment.

TheRequest
2.      The Executive Directorsby        creating the InspectionPanel  ("Panel")
acknowledgedthe need for     an independentmechanismto         receivecomplaints
from groupswho believe they          have been or will be directly and adversely
affectedby a Bank-financedproject.       In the caseof this Request,communities
previouslyadverselyaffectedin         Rondoniabythe POLONOROESTEprogram
expected beneficial effects      from the implementationof       PLANAFLORO
according to the standards         and timetable promised    by the Bank, but
expectations were not met.           Therefore, on June 14, 1995,   the intended
beneficiariesrepresentedby     localnon govermnentalorganizations("NGOs")
requestedthe Panelto investigate("RequestforInspection")the reasonsforthe
Bank's failureto carryout its     commitmentto preventfurtherdamageto       their
land. TheRequesters'fundamentalcomplaintis          that the Project-intended to
be beneficialto fragilecommunitiesandthe naturalenvironmentstheydepend
on for their livelihood-has       not been adequatelyimplementedsince     Board
approval3 1/2yearsago.Sincethe ClosingDateof the Loanis             December31,
 1996,it appearsthatjust one yearremainsforsuch objectivesto         be achieved.
Nevertheless,the Requestersfullysupportedsuchprojectobjectives.

 ManagementResponse
 3.     TheManagementResponse("Response")to            the RequestforInspection
 ("Request"),submittedtothe Panelon        July 19, 1995,acknowledgeda   number
 of instancesoflackof compliancewithpolicies.

PanelRecommendationandExecutiveDirectors'Decision
4.      On September12,1995the ExecutiveDirectorsconsideredthe Panel's
recommendation("Recommendation")relating         to the Request. The Panel
recommendedthat:"theExecutiveDirectorsauthorizean         investigationintothe
violations of Bank policies and procedures alleged inthe Request ...."


5.      The ExecutiveDirectors"agreedthat beforea      decisioncouldbe made

6.      At the same time the Executive Directors       "welcomed the project
implementationand supervisionmissionplannedtotake placeshortly,as         well
as Management'scommitmentto provide          periodic progress reports on the
project."

7.      Managementhas providedthe Panelwith         a draft Reportby Regional
Managemententitled, "Brazil: Rondonia Natural         Resources Management
Project (Loan 3444-BR)-- Report      on the Status of Implementation",dated
November 29, 1995("DraftReport").       The Draft Reportwas discussedin     a
meetingwithManagementonDecember4,          1995.

Materialityof Damages

CurrentSituationin Rondonia
10.     The Requesters base their     Request on perceived   continuing damage to
their livelihood, environment   and cultural heritage.   This Panel has confirmed
this through local sources      including intended project      beneficiaries, news
reports, satellite imagery,    and other sources of       information.    However,

information on the material   impact of, for example, selective   illegal logging of

valuable trees, seasonal    incursions, and physical     intimidation can only   be

provided by court, police    and other records, and    first hand accounts through
conduct of an investigation.


11.     Local sources confirm      damage claimed by      the Requesters, and this
includes information from     interviews conducted by     the Inspector who visited
the Project area in August   1995. Photographs of     damage in the reserves   taken

by the Inspector and     others are available to    the Executive Directors    upon

request.    Furthermore, ANNEX         B contains copies of      records of illegal
deforestation and seizure    of stolen timber, notices,    and citations issued by
IBAMA, and letters sent        to state and local authorities      by rubber taper

organizations, regarding    recent deforestation and    invasions in the Extractive
Reserve of Rio Cautario       Area.    The letters describe several     incidents of
violence against the families   living in the Reserve Area.


 12.     Widespread public awareness       of the situation in the Amazon-and     in

particular, Rondonia-has      been the result of     the many reports at the   local,

national and international     level from 1993 onwards.         Repeated claims of
 increasing damage and     a worsening situation  in the areas that are supposed  to

 be properly established,  demarcated and protected     under PLANAFLORO have
 appeared in a number of     publications. ANNEX       C contains a sample of   such
 local and national and international reports.


 13.     Material harm to affected    parties in Rondonia is    basically caused by

 four different activities:

         * Illegal logging
         * Illegal settlements accepted and     promoted by INCRA
         * Invasions of protected areas
         * Burning

 Illegal logging

  14.    By definition there is no    authoritative data available  at this stage but
 there is abundant evidence of    illegal logging activities contained in many news

items, and in NGO reports. The Management Response to the Request and its
current Draft Report recognize its widespread existence (see, for example,
Draft Report, Annex A, paras. 14 & 29).

Illegal settlements accepted and promoted by INCRA

15.     Illegal settlements have been widely reported by NGOs and inhabitants
in Rondonia. Management also acknowledges that INCRA has allowed illegal
settlement in areas that were supposed to be protected by the Project. For
example the Report states:

        "In spite of the Agreement signed between Rondonia and INCRA. in
        November 19921(condition of effectiveness), during the first two years
        of project implementation INCRA tended to pursue an independent
        path, often in contradiction to the requirements of Zoning. The State,
        for political reasons, was not able to obtain INCRA's compliance with
        project objectives nor was it able to define the rules for joint State-
        INCRA action to ensure full compliance with Zoning in the
        implementation of the State's lanidtenure policy. The result was that
        from 1992 to April 1995, INCRA attempted to establish seven land
        settlement in Zones 3, 4, and 5, and about 5% of land titles issued
        during that period were for land holdings in those Zones in direct
        conflict with provisions of the Zoning Law." (Draft Report, Annex A,
        para. 4).

However, interview sources suggest that the figure of 5% appears conservative
and does not either indicate how many titles were issued and the total size of
the area illegally settled.

Invasions of protected areas

16.     The Request, local NGOs and eyewitnesses interviewed by the
Inspector have reported incidents of invasions of protected areas. Management
corroborates several widespread invasions:

        "One of the CUs [Conservation Units], the Candeias State Park
        (covering about 9,000 ha.) has been degraded and is being substituted
        by an expansion (of more than 55,000 ha.) of the Samuel Ecological
        Station."

        "[M]ost of the [State Forest Reserves] to be maintained under the
        Project present serious land tenure problems as they were created either
        on private land or have been seriously invaded and are currently highly
        degraded." [Emphasis added]

       the demarcated reserves of       Uru-eu-wau-wau and Mequens."         ("Draft
        Report" Annex A paras. 9,     18, 28).

Burning

17.     The substantial increase in fires  in the Amazon, Rondonia in particular,
has been widely reported      at local, national and international     levels.  The
indicator most utilized is  the report of the Brazilian Space    Research Institute
(INPE). Based on weather       satellites information 39,000    fires in July 1995
alone are reported, five times    the number of July 1994. According          to this
source there were record levels   of set fires during the entiredry season of 1995.
Other data seem to confirm       this report. An article in VEJA-a         respected
Brazilian weekly publication-provides        a compelling description of the   level

of burning and deforestation      in the Amazon region and        their undeniable
consequences for the livelihood        of its inhabitants.      As an illustration,
ANNEX C contains, inter        alia, articles from the New     York Times, Times
Magazine, and VEJA. The burning,        whether done to clear land for   agricultural
purposes (generally without     legal permits) or to destroy    forests in order to
claim title to land, disrupt zoning  and, damages the natural resource    base-the
resource PLANAFLORO was intended           to conserve.

Impact of Activities

Deforestation

18.     All the above four activities result in deforestation.


19.     In the absence of the project,   PLANAFLORO forecasted deforestation
to be around 850,000 ha per     year (SAR Annex 3).        This figure is obviously
exaggerated, given INPE's estimate       of cumulative deforestation in    Rondonia
since 1960 of 2,000,000 ha.         A recent study by FAO (Forest         Resources
Assessment, 1990), on the other       hand, estimates deforestation    in Rondonia
during the 1980s at 231,000     ha per year, equivalent to 1.1%    of the total land
area per year. Therefore the   PLANAFLORO original forecast        is off by a factor
of four. Based on unrealistic    data, Project actions were supposed    to lower this
rate to below 300,000 ha per   year during the first three years, 200,000 ha in the
fourth year and 100,000 ha    in the fifth.


20.     In the absence of yearly deforestation      rates from satellite data which
should have been, but have not     been provided by the Project,   it is necessary to
rely on literature data to estimate deforestation rates from 1992-1995.


 21.    Deforestation rates for recent       years have been estimated      to range
between 200,000 and 400,000       ha per year. Moreover, the problem       appears to



                                           8

have worsened considerably this year, in particular with respect to fires which
more than double last year's figures (seepara. 17 above).


22.            Satellite imagery. This is now available and can be analyzed to
provide statewide deforestation rates during the life of the project. Although
 statewide analysis of deforestation trends in Rondonia based on satellite
 imagery will not be available until early 1996, the trend is illustrated by
 analysis of the Uru-eu-wau-wau indigenous reserve, where in that one reserve
 alone, the deforested area rose from 2,700 ha to 15,500 ha between 1992 and
 1995-almost a 600% increase. For further discussion see Box 3.

Losses through Deforestation

23.            Estimates are required to assess losses and wasted resources.
Deforestation eats away the State's natural capital and contributes to the loss
of forest reserves. There are well established methods to calculate the loss of
forest reserves and correct national income accounts to take into consideration
the depreciation of natural assets. These methods rely on the calculation of
different types of losses produced by deforestation, including loss of wood,
soils, etc. The three boxes below contain: (1) a note on methodology; (2) an
estimate of material damage by forest loss statewide; and (3) an estimate of
material damage by forest-foss in the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve from 1992-
 1995. The estimates of damage are calculated from the value of wood alone.

24.    In addition to the resulting monetary losses illustrated   with reference to

one of the many tribes represented in the Request, additional    major losses, of a

social and envirorntenta   nature not calculated here  could be verified through

an investigation.

Loss of sustainable income

25.     Estimation of the damage    by loss of wood alone    is not appropriate. It
does not capture other     indirect impacts on    income.     Rubber tappers and
indigenous people live  mostly in a subsistence economy,      many of them at the

marginal level.


26.     Deforestation impacts   these groups because   it reduces the size of  their

reserves and destroys   forest resources. It   also forces them to devote     time,

which would otherwise     be devoted to productive    activities, to police, control

and report deforestation   to the authorities- many     times with disappointing
results. For example,   rubber tappers interviewed     by the Panel in the      Rio

Cautario extractive reserve  claimed that they had   to spend about 10% of     their

productive time in activities related to deforestation control and that this loss of

time had a proportional   impact on their income.    Recent reports from the    Rio

Cautario area claim     that since decreed in       August 1995-and         pending

implementation and enforcement       of the borders-one-third      of their time is

now being spent on    surveillance (see para.  64 below). Considering       that the

average income was estimated      at about $100 per month     per family, a loss of
one-third of income further   underlines the extent  and materiality of immediate
damage caused by delays.


27.     Due to delays in establishment   of the Rio Cautario reserve,   its area had

to be reduced because      squatters settled there   pending demarcation.       The

 reduction of the reserve area has also resulted in theloss of income: the   loss of

 sustainable cashew  nut production of about   200 barrels per year,  for which the

 community of about      fifty families would     obtain about $3,000-again        a

 considerable damage   in relative terms.


 28.    De-facto Zoning Changes.           These examples illustrate      a typical

 problem which inevitably    arises when restrictive agro-ecological zoning    plans

 are publicly announced    but planning and execution    are not synchronized.    In



                                         11

other words, achievement of the   objectives of project such as PLANAFLORO
depended heavily on its timely   execution. Otherwise, as has    occurred before,
there is a rush to occupy   land or extract wood from targeted     areas before it
becomes prohibited. Therefore     Staff's repeated acceptance   of expanded time
periods for implementation    of critical components enabled    the inevitable to

continue.



Armed Conflicts

29.     Illegal logging activities cause    harm or threatened harm to         both
indigenous people and rubber     tappers. Both groups face constant      threats to
their lives by loggers or the   armed groups they hire to     protect their illegal
deforestation operations. Since    many reserves were not legally      declared or
physically demarcated, the Forest      Police have been, at best,     reluctant to
intervene: rubber tappers    or indigenous people must    deal with such threats
themselves. Rubber tappers     interviewed by the Inspector   in the Rio Cautario
extractive reserve highlighted   the fact that they must continuously    risk their
lives patrolling their reservein an attempt to control illegallogging operations.
Both the rubber tappers and   leaders of their statewide organizations   informed
the Panel that the situation in Rio Cautario prevails in most,    if not all, of the
extractive reserves throughout     the State.   A 1993 BTO and independent
observers have confirmed these    statements.


30.     Another example, relating to    isolated tribes is provided in   the Aide-
Memoire of the October, 1995 Bank's       mission to Rondonia. A contact      group
for isolated indigenous people,     along with some members of        the isolated
groups, were chased away by armed loggers.

Health

31.     The Requesters claim they have     suffered material damage through    lack
 of basic health delivery mechanisms    in particular to indigenous people.    This
has been compounded by the      fact that federal agencies withdrew   their support
for Amerindian health services     since they were supposed     to be funded by
PLANAFLORO. Management, on            the other hand, recognizedthat   provision of
 health services was "precarious"  and "intermittent" until mobile  medical teams
 visited every indigenous reserve    "on a regular basis starting     in February
 1995." (Draft Report, Annex    A, paras. 31 & 32). In August      1995, however,
 provision of only intermittent health services and many cases   of malaria (35 in
 one month) were reported in     one indigenous peoples reserve     visited by the
 Panel. Others interviewed     reported that statewide infant    mortality due to
 malaria is unacceptably high.       Although there are further      indications of
 material damage, the Panel     cannot assess its extent at   this stage since no
 reliable data are currently available. Such data could only be obtained      on the
 ground during an investigation.

BankPolicies& Procedures

33.    The Panel's task is to establish whether the           design and/or
implementationof the project has been consistentwith      Bank policies and
procedures; and if not, whetherthe Bank-through its   actionsor omissions-
has contributedto the harm sufferedby affectedpartiesand    if so, whetherit
has failedto remedythe situation.

34.    The Requestersclaim that the Bank violated a     number of its own
policies and proceduresin relationto the design and implementationof     the
Project. Theadverseeffectsof suchviolationswerecompounded,accordingto
the Requesters,by the inabilityor unwillingnessof the  Bankto followup on
the obligationsof the Federal and State Governmentsunder        the loan and
projectagreements.

LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE (OMS 2.12                     AND OD 13.40)


37.     According to the Operational Directive ("OD")                13.60, "one of the
central ways in which the Bank improves           its performance is by utilizing the
findings of the Operations Evaluation Department                ("OED").       The failed
POLONOROESTE program was extensively                  reviewed by OED in a special
Report No. 10039 ("OED Report").                It comprehensively chronicled and
analyzed implementation failures of the social and environmental              components
of the program. Based on this the OED             Report spelled out what the Bank
needed to do to design and implement any             follow-on projects in Rondonia.
The SAR should have provided a complete             accounting of how the follow-up
Project, PLANAFLORO, had taken into consideration the                OED Report's "key
findings and recommendations."


38.      It is worth noting that, while not circulated to      the Executive Directors
until April 1992-two months after approval           of the PLANAFLORO loan-the
OED Report was initially circulated for comment               in 1990. Therefore, in
addition to the Region's Project Completion             Reports ("PCR"), lessons of
experience were available to Staff and Management               during the design and
appraisal of PLANAFLORO. A summaryof                a relevant part of the OED Report
is attached as ANNEX D.


39.      Fundamental problems in implementation              essentially resulted from
design failures which did not adequately take         into account the lessons of the
POLONOROESTE experience. Although the                 Staff Appraisal Report ("SAR"
pp. 13-14) cites the "main lessons" learned           from implementing agricultural
projects under the POLONOROESTE program,                  the Project design and SAR
failed, in reality, to draw upon the environmental        and supervisory lessons. As
a result, the Panel considers that the Bank          failed to anticipate most of the
existing major implementation problems at the         design phase.



Institutional Capacity Building (OMS 2.12)

40.      The Bank's policy is categorical with regard         to the importance of the
project institutions, noting the centrality           of "the relationship between
institutional and output objectives so that           the institutional and physical


3The    POLONOROESTE program was launched by        the President of Brazil on May 27, 1981,
and was carried out with primary external financial support from six separate loans from the
Bank totaling US$ 434.4 approved in 1981-1983.       The primary objective was to pave the
existing BR-364 highway from Cuiaba to    Porto Velho, and to provide related investmentsfor
"harmonious socio-economic development"       of the region.    The last Bank loan (New
 Settlements Credit) was closed on March 31,1992.

components can be made mutually         supporting and the priority and    strategy of
institutional efforts clarified."4   The policy further identifies    a key issue in
Rondonia: "knowledge of local        traditions and attitudes is likewise essential in
the design of workable institutional    arrangements."5


41.        Lesson of Experience. Staff      also received invaluable advice    FROM
the OED Report, which stated        that before embarking on any      further work in
Rondonia, the Bank must be           satisfied that there are:      "Sufficient legal,
technical, institutional and, above     all, enforcement capabilities to   adequately
anticipate, monitor and control      the direct and indirect adverse   environmental
impacts of on-going development        processes at the local, state, and/or  regional
levels." The OED was deeply        concerned about this issue, and    went on to say,
"An obvious lesson for the     future is the need to give particular  attention to the
judicious selection of the coordinating     agency, as well as to the design  of inter-

institutional and implementing          arrangements, in programs         of similar
complexity. More generally,       this implies the need for the   Bank to give much
greater attention to institutional       analysis and assessment during        project
appraisal and to institutional   strengthening and development       in project design
and supervision."6


42.        Sufficient institutional capacity   building to handle the ambitious,
complicated PLANAFLORO             program was not incorporated         in the design
phase. High standards, tight       timetables/deadlines, and multiple    tasks spread
among a large number of State       level implementing agencies    were built into the
program. In view of past experience,        the Bank's expectations of the   borrower
were unrealistic given the          then existing or foreseeable
                                                    .                    capacity for
implementation. Basic implementation           problems and delays stem from       this
fundamental flaw in the design     of the institutionalinfrastructure.



Agro-Ecological Zoning: Demarcation            and Enforcement (OPN 11.02)

43.        Bank policy on Wildlands      requires protection of remaining      natural
habitats, especially when         the areas are coterminous         with indigenous
populations whose social and       cultural traditions are respected.    The Amazon
has long been identified as     a priority area by the Bank   for this approach.7 The
directive in Annex III of Operational Note      ("OPN") 11.02 is highly relevant     to
the issues that arose in design      and in implementation of      PLANAFLORO --
 "Implementation of important         wildland components should,        as a general
 principle, be well underway         before a project's major       land clearing or
 construction works are allowed      to proceed." The infrastructure    component of

the PLANAFLORO Project includes        rehabilitation of 3,900 kms of state   and
municipal roads and pavement      of 81 kms, as well as other transport       and
maintenance activities-utilizing about   a quarter of the total Project financing.
In Rondonia there has always been       a central tension between the need to
demarcate and support reserves and   the popular demand for more construction
and rehabilitation of roads and other infrastructure.


44.    For that reason, the PLANAFLOROproject         was designed to address, as
a stated priority, the inappropriateexploitation of fragile areas due to absence
of zoning and land use controls by providing      a conceptual and institutional
framework to introduce agro-ecological    zoning based on a map more precise
than the one produced by the POLONOROESTE                 project at a scale of
1:1,000,000 which was the "first approximation" to    agro-ecological zoning.


45.    PLANAFLORO's implementation          of agro-ecological zoning depended
on the existence of detailed zoning   and soil maps at a scale of 1:500,000     in
Zone 1, (1.) 1:100,000 in Zone 1 (1.2),   1:250,000 in Zone 1 (1.3 and 1.4)   and
1:500,000 in Zones 4, 5 and 6. These     maps were essential for the so-called
 "second approximation", which was     to be the basis for all legal demarcation
of reserved areas and their enforcement,     according to the SAR (para. 3.12)
which states:

       "The available maps of Rondonia      are at a scale of 1:1,000,000, except
       for a soil map of 1:500,000. While         these have been adequate for
        general planning purposes, smaller     scale maps are now needed for
        detailed planning and implementation   (e.g., for proper border control of
        zones and reserves; agro-forestry planning     for specific areas within
        Zone 1 and 2).       The project would finance the        preparation and
        distribution by ITERON of statewide      agro-ecological, climatological,
        soil and topographical maps.        During negotiations, the State      of
        Rondonia provided assurances         that these statewide maps,        all
        satisfactory to the Bank, would   be completed no later than December
        31, 1993and subsequently distributed    (para. 4.01 (b))."


        "The project would also support    the cartographic work necessary     for
        the creation, management and protection     of conservation units, public
        forests, extractive reserves and  Amerindian reserves, and the      border
        demarcation of approximately 9,900    kms and re-demarcation of another
        1, 600 kms..." (para. 3.13).

 It is not clear why the Management         Response characterized the      second
 approximation as mere "initial     refinements" of existing statewide       maps

 (Response 3.48).

46.    Lesson of Experience. A basic recommendation          of the OED Report
was that much better and more extensive data      gathering had to occur before
launching follow-on efforts, with particular criticism    leveled at the state of
knowledge about agro-ecological and socio-economic        realities in Rondonia.
According to OMS 2.12, "it is essential to prepare  the project asfar aspossible
in light of the available information, to  specify clearly the project objectives
and ensure the commitment of the Borrower       (and the beneficiaries) to them,
and to outline in some detail the essentialinputs and arrangements with respect
to organization, institutions and procedures  that are expected to be necessary
for achieving the objectives."8 If, as acknowledgedby   Management, the second
approximation was crucial to the project--  it should have been included in the
design phase of the project or made a condition  of loan effectiveness. As in the
case of POLONOROESTE, the Bank again         failed at the design stage to ensure
that the protection of natural habitats and   the homes of indigenous people
would have the highest priority. Instead, the requirement     for the contracting
and completion of the secondapproximation     was includedas a dated obligation
in the Project Agreement (Sec. 2.04), due to be  completed early-no later than
December 31, 1993. As discussed below at       para. 62, nearly two years later,
the Draft Report indicates that the contractfor  thisfundamental component of
theproject has still not been signed.

Amerindian Component (OMS 2.34)

47.     The design of the Amerindian component        appears to have complied
with much of Operational Manual Statement         ("OMS") 2.34 except for the
central problem that no forum was created           for direct participation of
Amerindians in the project planning, design and   implementation.


48.     Management failed to take adequately into account        the well known
coordination problems among key agencies       in Rondonia (FUNAI, ITERON,
INCRA and SEDAM), despite OED's explicit         warning that no single agency
was able to carry the institutional burden of  programming to the Amerindian
populations.


49.     Lesson of Experience. One important lesson      from POLONOROESTE
was that demarcation alone was not enough:

        "The physical demarcation of environmental       conservation units and
        Amerindian reserves is a necessary, but not     sufficient, condition for
        their protection. Financial disincentives, such as the absence of public
        physical and social infrastructure in the surrounding    areas and strong
        enforcement capacity to prevent and punish    invasions are also required
        for ensuring the protection of such areas."9

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS


Institutional Capacity

50.     The particular weaknesses of state environmental        institutions were
recognized in the 1994 Management "Status of    Implementation Report" for the
Executive Directors. Paragraph 60 Annex A of        the Draft Report recognizes
that co-ordination of Project activities has been weak  and that fragility of key
implementing agencies has been detrimental      to Project execution (see also
para. 52 below). In terms of strengthening State institutional   capabilities, the
Report shows that after almost three years    there remains weak co-ordination
among State and Federal agencies and ambitious    state-wide execution plans are
now mostly restricted to 15 "priority" municipalities  (Draft Report, Annex A.
para 63).


Infrastructure Expenditures

51.     An objective of the Project was to remedy        the adverse effects of
implementation of infrastructure components         of the POLONOROESTE
program. The OED Report documents          the adverse effects of an imbalance
between expenditures for the infrastructure    and environmental components.
Under this Project the imbalance, as noted    by the Staff, continues. A recent
supervision mission pointed out that over         half of the 1995 program
expenditures have been on infrastructure, and   that a redress of that imbalance
would allow greater emphasis on the credit component.


52.     At the end of 1992 Staff predicted there would          be delays in the
environmental component due to the underdeveloped        nature of implementing
institutions. To this end, a BTO memorandum (which       also dealt with a related
project in Mato Grosso), suggestedthat disbursements     on infrastructure should
be tied to progress in implementing       the environmental components after
observing as follows:

         "In both states institutions responsible       for implementing the
         environmental components are extremely     weak. The elements of the
         environmental components and the steps    necessary to implement them
         were not understood at the implementationlevel   in either state.


         In both states implementing agencies  attribute problems of preparation
         to a high Staff turnover (poor wages   and morale), the long delays in
         project preparation, changes in Bank    personnel (lack of continuity)
         during Bankpreparation, and limited  access to project documentation at
         the implementation level.



                                         18

       Significantly, infrastructure components    of the projects do not suffer
       from the same delay-causingpreparation problems.

       Given the relative preparation     of environmental and infrastructure
       components of the projects (in an    all-too-familiar scenario) the  Bank
       will retain little leverage (disbursements)    by the time the states are
       required to show their commitment to    the environmental components.
       [Emphasis added]


53.    The April 1995 supervision       mission acknowledged the potentially
damaging environmental impact         of continuing road construction        long
recognized to have adverse environmental    effects. The letter sent to ratifythe
findings of the mission indicates  how difficult it was to stop construction  of a
road even though it was three years after the beginning of PLANAFLORO:

       "We would also like to highlight your    personal commitment to ensure
       that the construction of the highway   BR-421 will be discontinued as it
       contradicts the recommendations of    the first approximation of the agro-
       ecological socio-economic zoning       and threatens the integrity of
       indigenous and extractive reserves and   conservation units." [Emphasis
       added]

ProjectAdministration

Supervision (OD 13.05)


54.     Despite   design    failures Management        should have     identified
implementation problems and      moved expeditiously to solve them-through
adequate supervision and monitoring.     Failure to enforce loan obligations    in
violation of policies and procedures has  undoubtedly contributed to the above-
noted material damage.

Suspension of Disbursements (OD 13.40)

55.     Lesson of Experience. History     repeats itself in Rondonia's treatment
of the indigenous people. In the POLONOROESTE           program, major problems
were addressed only after major     external protests and the completion    of the
mid-term review in early 1985. Some      progress was made on the Amerindian
component of POLONOROESTE                after the Bank finally        suspended
disbursements in March 1985--the first   time ever on environmental and social
grounds. Funding was resumed in August      1985 after federal authorities moved
to protect several vulnerable Amerindian    areas and agreement was reached on
an agenda for redirecting the program.




                                        19

56.    OED recommended        early use of this remedy    to ensure compliance     in

any future project of thistype in Rondonia. The records     examined by the Panel

show that     suspension of disbursements           was never considered          for

PLANAFLORO until       after the Request for  Inspection was filed   with the Panel.


Supervision(OD13.05);MonitoringandEvaluation(OD10.70)


57.     PLANAFLORO was          needed because the      social and environmental
components of POLONOROESTE             were neither adequate     nor implemented.

Yet to date very little     of what was planned       under PLANAFLORO           has

materialized. Year after  year, as in POLONOROESTE,          new target dates were

set for completion  of various actions. Had    the Bank insisted on    the timetable

set out in the Project documents, intended    beneficiaries and their  environment

would have been better   rather than worse off.



Delays and lack of enforcement

58.     A review of selected      Aide-Memoire from      November 1992 through

October 1995 shows      how deadlines set for     implementation of various     tasks

were repeatedly unmet.      The solution, in some    cases still continuing,  was to

agree to another deadline   in the next supervision  mission's Aide-Memoire.       In

other cases dates for completion   of activities were setbut,  based on a review of

selected intemal documents,     there appears to have  been no follow-up in    many

cases. In any event,   the lack of commitment     of both parties to such  deadlines

is evidenced by the fact  that they neglected to   update the specific deadlines set

forth in the loan and   project agreements.      Indeed, as a result, through these

repeated informal extensions     their enforcement became     increasingly unlikely.

ANNEX E contains       an illustrative table tracing this pattern  in relation to the

Second Approximation        (mapping), Legal Establishment        of Reserves and

Physical Demarcation,     Enforcement of Zoning,     Project Beneficiary and   NGO

Participation in Project  Execution, and the Amerindian    Component.


 Implementation    and Supervision of    Credit Component

 59.     Part B.3 of the Project  described in Schedule   2 of the Loan Agreement

 lays out the requirements   for the development    of rural credit including,   inter

 alia, formal establishment       of a denominated         in-kind credit system,
 administration of such   a system by BERON,      and gradual provision   of such in-

 kind credit. The    institutional weakness   and strained financial    condition of

 BERON was apparent       from the outset, yet   insufficient attention was given to

 the Credit component    in the various Aide-Memoire.     The component appears     to

 have been introduced       very late:    only a small portion       of funding for

 agroforestry has been   released so far. Lack   of supervision and proper   auditing




                                          20

procedures cast serious doubts about the effectiveness and proper execution of
this component.

Supervision of Accounting andAuditing

60.     Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement and section 3.01 of the Project
Agreement lay out normal requirements for financial reporting, including
maintenance of separate accounts and annual audits. After almost three years
of Project execution, no appropriate accounting and audit reports have been
received. A Bank expert noted a number of irregularities in the accounting of
loan funds. In spite of this the Bank continues disbursing on the basis of
statements of expenditure. Now the Bank appears to have agreed to a "quick
fix" to pending audit reports (Annex B, Draft Report) The Panel is most
concerned that the necessary remedies, should the auditors discover any
misapplication of funds since 1993, may either be impossible to implement or
damage the overall potential of the project.

Monitoring and Evaluation

61.    The Bank did not succeed in making Project monitoring operational.
The Independent Evaluation Committee ("IEC"), required under Project
Agreement 2.08(a), submitted only a draft of its first annual report six months
late, no final, and no other reports since. The IEC represented an innovative
effort at joint monitoring involving the borrower, the Bank, and NGOs. It did
not work out (Report, Annex A para. 31). Instead, the monitoring and
evaluation work has been contracted out to a consulting firm.

SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS


Land Tenure Regularization

62.    Illegal    Settlements (INCRA).           The Management       Response
characterized INCRA as "a Federal entity whose commitment to Project goals
both in word and deed is asine qua non for success." No new settlements were
supposed to be created and no titling of lands undertaken in areas that do not
have sustainable development potential as identified by the agro-ecological
zoning: The fundamental importance of this was recognized by requiring
existence of an Agreement between INCRA and the State-as          condition of
effectiveness of the Loan. The following notes the history and adverse effects
acknowledged by Staff:

        * Section 2.12(a) of the Project Agreement required Rondonia to
             "enter into an      agreement with     INCRA concerning       land
             regularization policies and practices to be observed in the State,
             which shall be consistent with the objectives of sound forestry
             protection and management, on terms and conditions satisfactory to




                                       21

  (Loan Agreement.   Section 6.01(b)).

  condition of effectiveness was complied    with in November   1992.


* An Agreement,    apparently "satisfactory  to the Bank"  was signed  in

  November    1992. However      this Agreement,  as correctly  stated by

  the Requesters,   did not cover     land regularization   activities by
                                                                     have
  INCRA. Such      activities, as recognized by   Staff (see below)

  resulted in    material    adverse effects     for intended      Project

   beneficiaries.

* A 1994     Aide-Memoire     indicates that  neither the  borrower nor

   Management believed that    the appropriate agreement existed:


      "The mission   was not able to  discuss with  the Regional  INCRA

      Staff the problems   related to land  regulation, which  are one of

      the main obstacles    to the project's outcome. It   was noted that

      the lack of  an agreement     between the   State of Rondonia    and

      INCRA has     inhibited resolution  of the land  problems in   areas

      4, 5 and 6, and  consolidation of the  land situationin zones 1 and

      2. Although     it was previously   agreed with   Bank missions    to

      prepare and   implement a    detailed work  plan to carry  out these

      tasks, this was not  done." [Emphasis added]


 * A letter  sent to ratify the findings  of the April   1995 supervision

   mission addresses  the issue directly and  indicates thatthe Bank may

   finally have  been willing  to exercising its remedies  under the Loan

   Agreement:

       "...the Bank is also highly concerned   with the inter-institutional

       collaboration  required first, to ensure an  orderly occupation   of

       land in Rondonia    based on the   socio-economic   agro-ecological

       zoning and second,      to create and  maintain the   conservation,

       extractive, and     Indigenous    reserves envisaged     under the

       referenced project   and stipulated in the Loan Agreement     3444-

       BR, signed     between the     Federal Govt.    and the Bank      on

        September   19, 1992. To     that end, and  as I am sure   you are
                                                                       with
        aware, it isessentialfor   INCRA to enter  into an agreement

        the State of  Rondonia on     the lines discussed  in Brasilia,  on
                                                                   the State
        April 10 and  11, 1995, among    the mission, INCRA and
                                                              parties of the
        Government.    The Bank, as   one of the contracting

        referenced  Loan Agreement,       needs to have    a definition   of

                INCRA's ability and willingness to sign the agreement with the
                State tofulfill the obligations stipulated in Loan 3444-BR by a
                definite date. We have been informed by INCRA's President
                that the institution is currently analyzing the text of the Loan
                Agreement before it signs the agreement with the State.         We
                would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that if a
                satisfactory solution were notfound in the course of this month,
                the Bank will have no alternative but to consider the exercise   of
                its rights along the terms of the Loan Agreement. " [Emphases
                added]

        * The need for an appropriate agreement with INCRA            was so self-
            evident that the head of INCRA-Rondonia later informed              the
            Inspector during his visit that before its signature         INCRA's
            participation in PLANAFLORO was mostly "de-facto."

        * The required Agreement was finally signed after the Request for
            Inspection was filed--on July 4, 1995.          The signing of this
            Agreement prompted the head of INCRA-Rondonia to issue a set of
            instructions, long overdue, instructing regional offices to respect the
            zoning and other provisions of PLANAFLORO.

Second Approximation

63.     As noted above, mapping of the entire State in greater detail through
the second approximation was included in the legal documents as            a dated
obligation to be completed by December 31, 1993. That deadline        was missed.
In subsequent supervision missions, Staff asserted the growing     importance of
awarding the contract for mapping as soon as possible. It was not      done at the
time of the Request, and as noted in the Draft Report, has not yet    been signed.
Thus, there has been a violation of a major covenant    for almost two years with
significant adverse consequences for the protection of the areas where          the
Requesters live and work.

Legal Establishment of Reserves and Physical Demarcation

64.     Part B6 of the Project and provisions of the Loan and Project
Agreements provide for the redemarcation, protection and maintenance             of
conservation units and indigenous areas. The table in ANNEX       E indicates that
the list of areas to be redemarcated is repeated year after year.  Redemarcation
of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reservation, for example, is a repeated       priority in all
three 1995 Aide-Memoire. However, whether this will be          achieved in 1995
remains uncertain.

65.      The establishment of extractivereserves called for under the Project   has
been even more delayed. Early monitoring revealed that planned extractive



                                         23

                                                                                     be
reserves had   been so damaged     by unmanaged      logging that    it would not

worthwhile establishing   them as reserves.


Enforcement     of Zoning

66.     Part A of       the Project,    entitled "Environmental         Conservation,
                                                                                      of
Management      and Enforcement"       calls for safeguard       and protection

indigenous areas   and conservation   units, as well as construction    of civil works
                                                                                      of
and infrastructure  to make enforcement     possible. Continuous       enforcement

zoning was     supposed to   be carried out   by all agencies     including INCRA,

ITERON, IBAMA        and SEDAM.

                                                                                      of
67.      Monitoring    of Compliance     with Zoning.       Numerous violations

zoning have been    documented with    respect to the  first approximation     and they
                                                                        in the size of
 include INCRA     settlements  in zones 4,    5, and 6, reduction

 protected areas and extractive  reserves, and   illegal deforestation.   Where these

 shortcomings   have been recognized, the   response has   been to defer the   solution

 to area compensation   mechanisms    to be included   in the second    approximation.

 Since the initiation     of the second       approximation      has been delayed

 considerably,  effective compliance   and monitoring    of zoning have     not been a
                                                                              has been
 priority. It is necessary to  ascertain the  specific level  of effort that

 devoted to compliance     with zoning   as well as to   establish a complete     list of

 zoning violations.

                                                                               of
 68.     One particularly  difficult area has been control  and monitoring

 illegal deforestation, where efforts appear to  have been lax due     to inadequate

 resource allocation and lack of coordination between      different institutions.


 69.     To evaluate the  extent of deforestation monitoring     it is necessary to

 evaluate the number of   illegal deforestation claims   vis-A-visthe number     and

  distribution ofcontrol efforts, in particular inprotected  areas such as

  Amerindian   reserves and extractive  reserves.


  70.     Yearly satelliteimages were    supposed to be   utilized to monitor
                                                                            no yearly
  deforestation, new roads and new    settlements.   At the present time,

  deforestation studies have been   completed using   satellite imagery.    Recently,
                                                                                project
  1994 was substituted   as the year tobe used as baseline   data to measure

  progress. This  choice of year is  disturbing, given the  fact that the Loan   was
                                                                                    no
  approved in  March 1992.    Since no baseline   had been chosen     prior to this,

  deforestation rates have been calculated since    1992. Delays     in project

  implementation   clearly contributed to  forestreserve   losses that, as indicated in

  Box 2, could reach   hundreds of  millions of dollars over   the life of the project.

 PopularParticipation:InvolvementofNGOs--OD 14.70
 71.     The    innovative    PLANAFLORO         design    for   participation   of
 beneficiaries, both through the five        regulatory commissions and the
 Independent Evaluation Committee, was a challenging        task that should have
 received significant Staff support. It quickly  became apparent, however, that
 some groups of beneficiaries were not represented      by the NGOs. Relations
between the NGO Forum and the borrower broke         down in 1994, were patched
up briefly by a Bank supervisory mission, and       in the words of Bank Staff,
"deteriorated again during the last months  of 1994." As of the last supervision
mission, attempts were still underway to     bring in special consultants to re-
establish trust among the borrower, the NGOs, and     the Bank.

72.      The Panel notes with concern that the Management       proposal to bring
into project management, private business organizations       (Draft Report para.
 11) may result in the inclusion of representatives  of the parties behind illegal
logging, burning and other anti-zoning activities.     The less sophisticated and
poor representatives of the Project intended            beneficiaries could be
outmaneuvered, lose their trust in the Bank     and further distance themselves
from the Project.

AmerindianComponent(OMS2.34;OD4.20)
73.      Part A.6 of the Project Agreement lists five major      requirements for
assistance to the Amerindians. Section 3.06 places        particular emphasis on
registration of the reserves, and provision of health care toall indigenous areas.
In internal reports it is acknowledged that illegal logging   in their reserves is
still not under control. Furthermore, the Uru-eu-wau-wau       reserve is still not
fully registered.   There is wide-spread recognition that this component         is
poorly managed, and has so far failed to attain      its objectives. Provisional
health measures, for example, are not sustainable without      Bank financing of
recurrent expenditures.

RemedialMeasures

74.     Since the Request was filed, Management has agreed      to some measures
to bring the project into compliance with policies    and to enforce obligations
under the legal agreements. The last three Bank      missions looked at possible
remedial measures and agreed, as in the past,       on a chronology of specific
actions. Now the past-due obligations in the   legal documents are pushed even
further into the future and as in the past,  the timetable is not been realistic.
Non-compliance continues.        The October mission indicated that, given
realities, a new approach to implementation might   be needed.

75.     The "Agreed Plan of Action" presented in Annex D      of the Draft Report
pushes forward dates of compliance through      actions and plans to be defined



                                       25

and agreed upon       in the near/medium      future, rather than   an attempt to

restructure the Project   around a comprehensive      and realistic assessment    of

available remedies   and attainable objectives.  To do so would necessarily   entail

taking into account      OED lessons of     experience and    the past flaws     and

shortcomings of PLANAFLORO.

76.     An open and fruitful    discussion with  Management and     Staff took place

during a meeting      on December     4, 1995. The agreed       remedial measures

contained in the    Plan attached to    the Draft Report   were explained.     Panel

members took the        opportunity to    express their underlying     concerns, in

particular with   the proposed time-frame    for the final definition and execution

of the Plan.

        The Panel would     like to thank Management and     Staff for all additional

 information they   provided and for   the frank, realisticassessment of the   status

 of the Project at this point in time.

 Findings
 * Although originally     conceived in part   to address adverse  effects of earlier

     projects, lessons  from the shortcomings   of the POLONOROESTE         program

     were too often   ignored in the preparation,   design and implementation      of

     PLANAFLORO.          Therefore, similar problems have occurred     that threaten

     to perpetuate social  and environmental   damage.


 * Failure of the    project's design to  take into account  the borrower's   limited

     institutional capacity    is forcing a belated    focus on a limited     set of

     achievable priorities.

 * Critical delays    occurred for three   years between approval   of the Loan and

     filing of the Request  because:


         * The Bank did       not supervise PLANAFLORO         effectively and failed

              to enforce implementation    of key actions that were to be the basis
              of successful executionof   the Project.


         * Supervision of      implementation has   been weak due to    the lack of a

              permanent presence     of Bank Staff in  the project area  and a rather

              complacent reaction    to repeated defaults  on covenants under      the

              Loan.


          *   Shortcomings in      supervision are evidenced by the    fact that long

              delayed actions    have suddenly become     possible since the  Request

              was filed.




                                            26



  I--            I-

* Delays in the project have contributed to a breakdown of trust between
    NGOs and the Bank, making the direct involvement of civil society in any
    reorientation of the Project important. Some of the remedial measures
    proposed in the Report regarding NGO participation may, however, result
    in future alienation of intended Project beneficiaries.

* Postponement of a timely reorientation of the Project has substantially
    delayed achievement of many of PLANAFLORO's objectives and caused
    continuing damageto the interests of intended beneficiaries.

* Now the situation for many intended beneficiaries is by and large worse
    than two years ago.

Conclusion

77.     This additional review further substantiates the materiality of the
damages and establishes the link between such damages and deviations from
Bank policies and procedures in the design, appraisal and implementation
phases.   There is also no evidence that the Bank considered a possible
enforcement of the borrower's and the State's obligations under the loan
documents, as provided in ODs 13.05 and 13.40. Such actions and omissions
must, in the Panel's opinion, be regarded as contributing to the material losses
suffered by the Requesters.

78.     To establish a comprehensive inventory of material damage throughout
all project areas, and to detail the link between such damage and specific
policy deviations, would take about six months. Attached is a "Work Plan"
which we would follow should the Executive Directors deem necessary the
conduct of a full investigation.

                 Proposed Investigation Work Plan on Request for Inspection
          Brazil: Rondonia Natural Resources Management           Project, Loan 3444 BR

A work plan for an investigation of complianceby   the Bank with its own policies and procedures
would necessarily include a review of the participation  by the Bank in, inter alia, the following
key elements of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management Project:

 1. Monitoring of Rondonia's forests, including   statewide deforestation data for the entire state
for the years 1992-1995 from LANDSAT satellite     imagery.

2. Implementation of improved land titling practices,  through a review of INCRA's land titling
practices in Zones 4,5, and 6, to determine the number  of titles and total land area titled in those
zones, and related measures taken by the Bank  to ensure compliancewith legal covenants.

3. Design and implementation of participation     by civil society in project structures, and the
support given by the Bank to development          of new local representative institutions for
beneficiaries.


4.   Supervision of essential institutional development,   through an analysis of enforcement
measures to control illegal deforestation throughout the       PLANAFLORO areas.            Possible
measures would include: number of patrols to stop illegal         logging operations; equipment
deployed and financial resources committed;          percentage of agency budgets spent on
enforcement activities; and detailed consideration of material  damage to reserve dwellers owing
to lack of enforcement.


5. Supervision of project benefits for indigenous peoples, through  an evaluation of contradictory
evidence submitted to the Panel about the actual delivery      of health services to Amerindian
populations, with due regard to local patterns of social     organization, religious beliefs, and
resource use. Possible data would include: vaccination       data, malaria incidence, number of
moblie medical teams to Amerindian reserves, and sustained    availability of medical personnel in
clinics.


6. Supervision of credit component of the project,  designed to be central to balanced economic
development of beneficiaries, through an analysis  of availability of funds for loans, and actual
application of funds.

7. Monitoring and supervision of accounting and auditing     in the project, and an assessment of
the effectiveness of remedial measures agreed upon to overcome shortcomings.

           WORLD BANK APPROACHES TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN BRAZIL

               A recent OED study* examines how the Bank has dealt
         with environmental concerns in several large projects in
         Brazil.  It looks at migration, human settlement, productive
         activities, and their effects on natural resource use over
         time.
               It finds that the Bank approached these projects with
         a concern for the environment, making pioneering efforts to
         broaden its traditional approach to project development.
         But in retrospect, many of the decisions made at preparation
         and appraisal took too little account of the social and
         physical environment.  This was partly because the Bank
         lacked enough knowledge about the socioeconomic context into
         which it was lending, and partly because its expertise in
         environmental matters was still very limited.  In the past
         fifteen years, with the growth of environmental awareness
         and expertise, environmental concerns have begun to be much
         better integrated into economic development initiatives.
         Nonetheless, the experience reviewed offers lessons relevant
         to current practice in Bank operations generally.

 Case studies
         The projects studied were approved in 1974-87 and most were
 completed in 1983-88.   They involved Bank  financing of some$1.15

         billion.

  [Sao Paulo: pollution  control

 Sao Francisco Valley:  power, resettlement,  irrigation

 Eastern Amazonia:   iron mining, associated  infrastructure]**


 Western Amazonia:  highway and rural development (POLONOROESTE)

       In 1981, the Government  launched the Northwest Region Integrated
Development Program, or POLONOROESTE,  in the agricultural frontier areas
of Rondonia and Western Mato Grosso,  at an estimated cost of $1.6

billion.  Its goal was to provide for sustainable  settlements by
expanding infrastructure  and supporting agriculture and social services.
The Bank's six loans  supported pavement of the federal highway between
Cuiaba and Porto Velho, extension  of feeder road networks in both
states, consolidation  of existing settlement schemes and support for the

establishment of  new ones, improvement of rural social services, and
measures to protect  the natural environment and indigenous peoples.  As

in the Carajas project, the Government  financed a Special Amerindian

Project within  a framework agreed with the Bank.

        The start of POLONOROESTE coincided with an economic crisis. Large

numbers of urban  dwellers, adding to the continuing flow of rural

migrants, headed for the northwest in the early and mid-1980s.  Much of
the environmental degradation that has been associated with POLONOROESTE
reflects the public sector's inability to control the rate of rural and
urban settlement and thus to keep incoming migrants from attempting to
exploit areas that the programwas meant to protect.    POLONOROESTE's
design incorporated what were--at the time and in the Amazonian frontier
context--progressive environmental and social concerns, and the Bank
tried to build safeguards into the program.  But preparation and
appraisal did not sufficiently consider what would happen if rates of
migration significantly exceeded expectations.

       Implementation conditions differed from those assumed at
appraisal: many more migrants than projected; inadequate and late
disbursements of counterpart funds, because of Brazil's difficult fiscal
situation; shortages of the investment credit needed to install
perennial crops; overly centralized project management; and ineffective
integration of participating agencies.  Roads were built successfully
and on time. But agricultural  support services, community facilities,
and environmental and Amerindian protection measures lagged behind.  The
Bank informally suspended disbursements in March 1985. Funding was
resumed in August 1985 after federal authorities moved to protect
several vulnerable Amerindian areas and agreement was reached on an
agenda for redirecting the program.

       As originally designed POLONOROESTE contained ambitious forestry,
environmental, and ecological research components, but implementation in
the early years was frustrated by inadequate technical knowledge, an
unsupportive policy environment, weak institutional capacity, and
shortages of counterpart funding.  The 1985 reorientation contributed to
important changes: establishment of state environmental protection
agencies, supported with program resources; higher taxes on forest
exploitation; bigger fines on illegal exploitation; establishment of a
Forestry Military Police, and of a State Forest Institute to provide
forest extension services.  On balance the Special Amerindian Project
has been effective thus far, but the longer-run sustainability of the
Indian reserves established is not yet assured.

The Bank's approach
       The Bank approached the projects studied with a concern for the
environment.  It made pioneering efforts to broaden its traditional
approach to project development, including the pre-appraisal
environmental "reconnaissance" of Sobradinho, the multi-disciplinary
Northwest region survey mission, participation by anthropologists and
ecologists in the appraisal and supervision of the Amerindian and
environmental protection components of Carajas and POLONOROESTE, and the
preparation and supervision of the Itaparica Resettlement Project.

       But in retrospect many of the decisions made at the preparation
and appraisal stages of the projects paid too little heed to the social
and physical environment.  Project design, appraisal, and the early
stages of execution did not take sufficient account of the likely
environmental effects of the investments. Partly this was because  the
Bank lacked enough knowledge about the socioeconomic context into which

more broadly gauged economic and sector work.  Partly, though, it was
because the Bank's expertise in environmental matters was still very
limited, and because ex ante environmental assessmentswere not
sufficiently comprehensive.  Processing of the operations did not
adequately address intersectoral and interregional linkages or the
effects that policy and economic incentives would haveon natural
resource use and environmental quality.

       To its credit, in the case of POLONOROESTEthe  Bank suspended
disbursements and called for reorientation when it saw that the program
was going awry.  In several of the projects reviewed, the adaptations
attempted to incorporate lessons learned and new Bank directives on how
to deal with environmental issues.

Recommendations
       These projects provided key inputs into the Bank's current
operational guidelines for assessing environmental and sociocultural
problems and impacts. Many of the lessons they yielded  have already
been absorbed by the Bank and by Brazilian government agencies. Areas
remain, however, where improvement is needed, or where these lessons of
experience are of value to other countries.

Environmental protection
       Institutional and technical capability:   The Bank should continue
to support the strengthening of environmental agencies in Brazil and
elsewhere.
       Public awareness and community participation:  To help generate
the political commitment and accountability needed to attain
environmental goals, the Bank should continue to support environmental
education programs and to encourage community associations and other
NGOs to participate in environmental monitoring.  Priority attention
should be given to low-income, heavily populated, and industrialized
areas.
       Regulation and economic incentives: Where the benefits  of such
measures clearly outweigh the costs, environmental protection requires a
mix of regulations and economic instruments including taxes, fees, and
other incentives. Adequate enforcement of environmental  regulations can
be very costly. An approach now being tested  by the Bank and the
Brazilian Government combines regulations with (1) a technical planning
instrument (agroecological zoning) to direct public and private
investments and (2) economic incentives and sanctions designed to
encourage more sustainable resource use. This  effort should be
carefully monitored.

Environmental assessment and management
       Need for thorough, broadly-based, initial assessments:  Developing
an adequate understanding of the specific settings involved is vital.
Such assessments, and action plans deriving from them, need to embrace a
broad enough area of influence. Proposed investments,  particularly in
ecologically sensitive areas, need to be assessed in the light of local
carrying capacities, if development is to be sustainable.

       A key dimension of environmental management concerns the
relationship between local development and that occurring elsewhere in

                                                                    4




the country.  Establishing an effective and environmentally-informed
national policy framework that considers spatial and intersectoral
linkages will not be easy. But because of its potential for improving
environmental management over the long run, this should be strongly
encouraged.

      Any public policy that directly or indirectly affects population
distribution, settlement patterns, productive activities, and, thus,
natural resource use will affect the environment. Potential
environmental and social consequences of macroeconomic and sectoral
policies should not be ignored, and mitigatory measures should be taken
when needed.  Environmental implications of policies for the
agricultural, industrial, power, and transport sectors should receive
special attention.
       Timing, sequencing: The Bank should become involved in project
preparation early enough to ensure that designs adequately take account
of environmental and social costs. Experience also emphasizes the
importance of proper sequencing.  In POLONOROESTE, for example, roads
were built on time but services for the resulting influx of migrants
were much slower to develop.  Implementation schedules for physical
infrastructure components should take account of the time needed to
prepare social or institutional development components adequately.

Bank activities and procedures
       The Bank can influence natural resource management and
environmental protection through its ongoing policy dialogue and
economic and sector work.  Though considerable progress has been made,
much remains to be done to better integrate environmental concerns into
ESW.

       Project identification, preparation, and appraisal: The Bank
should seek a thorough understanding of the ecological potentials and
constraints and the underlying socioeconomic, political, and
institutional processes that affect development in areas where it
proposes to support investments.  Particular attention should be given
to environmental impacts that may be irreversible and to areas with
large concentrations of population.
       Before lending, the Bank should realistically assess the
borrower's commitment and capacity to achieve project environmental
goals.  It should undertake extensive environmental and social risk
analysis, evaluate the borrower's institutional capabilities and
political will, include all necessary institutional strengthening
measures in project design, and promote better understanding of the
environmental and social implications of the borrower's policy and
investment decisions. All relevant national and local demographic,
economic, and governance factors should be clearly taken into account.
       Covenants, with provisions that are clear enough to be monitored,
should spell out the nature and expected timing of the environmental
precautions and mitigatory measures to be taken in connection with any
new operation; they should be firmly enforced.
       Supervision, monitoring and evaluation:   In several cases
reviewed, Bank supervision made a vital contribution to a positive
outcome.  In others, it was insufficient, often because of the Bank's
initial lack of appreciation of the complexities and dynamics of the

                                                                     5




project areas.
                                                       the environment
       Projects likely to have significant  effects on

need especially thorough supervision.   In countries where the

environmental portfolio is large and/or  rapidly growing, or where

current operations are likely to have significant  human or physical
                                                              one or more
environmental consequences, the Bank should  consider placing

representatives in the field to intensify  supervision and improve

communication with borrowers on such issues.

       More generally, the Bank should:
                   independent, multidisciplinary,  monitoring and ongoing
-      arrange for
evaluation, including mid-term reviews, of  environmental and social

performance and effects;
                           local, national,  and/or international NGOs in
-      involve responsible
such activities wherever feasible;  and,
                          reporting on  project environmental performance
-      improve completion
and impacts, and expand ex-post evaluation  on these matters.
                                                            measures to
       Sustainability:  Experience  emphasizes the need for
                                                                social

define these measures and agree upon  them with the borrower.

                 examine the issue and take appropriate measures.   NGOs and
                 Indian leadership participated in thediscussions related to
                 improving the protection of Indian reserves.  On the other
                 hand, agreements between rubber    tapper associations (i.e.,

                 Pimenta Bueno, and Jacy-Parana) and     SEDAM were not
                 yet signed (a). It was agreed that the agreements between
                 OSR and ITERON/SEDAM would be used           to funnel
                 resources from PLANAFLORO to the        local associations.
                 During the Mission's visit, agreements   were signed between
                 OSR and ITERON/SEDAM covering          10 rubber tapper
                 communities. During the period of this   mission, the State
                 signed 7 agreements for the implementation    of innovative

FROM: The President                                                 January 5, 1996




               Brazil: Rondonia Natural Resources Management Project
        Request for Inspection: Inspection Panel Report on Additional Review




1.            The Report on the Status of Implementation of the Brazil: Rondonia
Natural Resources Management Project, submitted to the Board on December 20, 1995
(SecM95-1271), describes the difficulties that have been             encountered  in the
implementation of this Project and the steps taken by the Bank, through its enhanced
supervision efforts, to address them.

2.             In view of the steps taken by the Bank, it is the judgment of Management
that the issues raised in the Request to the Inspection Panel can be resolved through
normal supervision channels and Bank/Government dialogue. It is also Management's
view that the agreed Plan of Action and the Bank's defined strategy for project
supervision, as described in the Report on the Status of Implementation, represent an
adequate response to the difficulties faced in the implementation of this complex and
innovative operation. For these reasons, it is Management's view that the issues raised
in the Request to the Inspection Panel may best be handled in this manner, rather than
through investigation by the Panel.
