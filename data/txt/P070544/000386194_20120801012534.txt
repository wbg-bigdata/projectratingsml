F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The original PDOs were to contribute to improved access to judicial and legal services and to the
accountable and transparent use of public financial resources. This was expected to be achieved
by assisting the GoT in improving the skills and systems to deliver judicial/legal services and
public financial management, and strengthening the capacity of oversight and watchdog
institutions (OWIs) to perform their role.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The original PDOs did not change.

The Results Framework presented in this Data Sheet is the one introduced during the
restructuring of 2010. It therefore incorporates the changes made at time of restructuring and has
been adopted in the post-restructuring period. For ease of reference, footnotes indicate if
intermediate outcome indicators that were revised or added at restructuring (new indicators). The
original RF (from approval), is attached in Annex 9.

(a) PDO Indicator(s)

 Indicator        Baseline Value           Original Target     Formally        Actual Value
                                           Values (from        Revised         Achieved at
                                           approval            Target          Completion or
                                           documents)          Values          Target Years
 Component 1
 Indicator 1 :    Percentage of court cases outstanding for two years or more
 Value            70 %                       40 %               20 %           14 %
 Date achieved    30/12/2005                                                   31/12/2011
 Comments         The target has been surpassed (130 % met). In 2011, a report has been
 (incl. %         commissioned and completed by the Judiciary (in collaboration with Bureau of
 achievement)     Statistics and a statistician provided by the DP) to verify this data. The figures
                  were found to be reliable.
 Component 2
 Indicator 2 :    Percentage of Ministries, Departments and Agencies with clean audit in National
                  Audit Report presented to parliament
 Value            86 %                      N/A                 88 %            78 %
 Date achieved    16/02/2009                                                    31/12/2011
 Comments         Target has been almost fully achieved (90 %). The decrease from the 2009
 (incl. %         baseline can be ascribed to the greater power and extended operations of the NAO

                                                                              Components 2, 3 and 4 did not change

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Despite an average annual growth rate of 5.1 percent in the 1997-2004 period,
poverty remained endemic in Tanzania, with a per capita annual income of 330 US $ .
Intent on addressing the country’s societal challenges comprehensively and following
thorough study and extensive consultation , in 2005 the Government adopted a National
Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA), which was based on three
clusters (i) growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii) improved quality of life and
social well-being; and (iii) good governance and accountability.

2.      In the view of both GoT and Development Partners, Tanzania’s lack of progress
on several dimensions of governance – such as transparency, accountability and
participation – had been constraining all prior government efforts to effectively reduce
poverty and improve development outcomes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on
governance was identified as the primary underpinning element for the totality of the
reform effort. In 1999 the Government designed and approved the National Framework
for Good Governance (NFGG). Being holistic and largely normative in its approach, the
NFGG provided the policy framework within which government agencies were expected
to initiate concrete measures to address poor governance and implement cross-cutting
public sector reforms.

3.      The change of Administration following the 2005 election re-affirmed the
political impetus behind the governance agenda. In his inaugural speech, newly elected
President Kikwete emphasized the need to put transparency and accountability at the top
of government’s priorities. In particular, he highlighted the need to enhance the fight
against corruption and strengthen key organs of governance, including the judiciary, the
Prevention of Corruption Bureau and the Ethics Secretariat (ES), while also recognizing
the critical role of effective public financial management (PFM) systems to ensure
efficient and effective use of scarce resources.

4.      Development Partners responded early by offering assistance particularly under
the public service reform program (PSRP), and the local government reform program
(LGRP). Other critical pillar areas of the NFGG, however, were receiving little (if any)
support from the donor community, with consequent lack of progress in the
corresponding components of the government program. An immediate challenge was
therefore to broaden support to GoT’s strategy aimed at freeing up the specific
governance blockages to the overall reform agenda represented by institutional
incapacities and bureaucratic pathologies.




                                           1
5.       Consistent with the higher level objectives defined in the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy10 (2000-2003), ATIP was designed to act as a channel of funding to
support critical areas of the NFGG whose implementation required additional support
from the donor community, and where the Bank had not previously been involved 11 ,
namely public financial management reform, legal sector and judicial reform, and the
National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP). In the case of PFM, the
ATIP was linked to the third Public Financial Management Reform Programme
(PRMRPIII) launched by the GoT with the support of the donor community. In the case
of the legal and judicial sector, the ATIP was linked to the Legal Sector Reform Program
(LSRP), designed and implemented with the broad participation of key legal/judicial
institutions and stakeholders. Finally, ATIP aimed to support the Good Governance
Coordination Unit, established by the GoT to provide leadership and coordination for
NACSAP implementation across MDAs.

6.       In addition to supporting supply-side institutional reforms, the ATIP provided the
Bank’s response to GoT’s new impetus on Oversight and Watchdog Institutions (OWIs)
by incorporating support to these institutions as part of the project activities. This was a
direct response to NFGG emphasis on the strategic role played by oversight institutions
and civil society organizations to empower citizens to monitor government performance
and hold the rulers to account, and the urgent need to strengthen the capacity of both state
and non-state actors to do so. Such design was also justified by the findings of political
economy work undertaken by the task team, as well as previous studies carried out by
other donors (namely, DfID ‘‘Drivers of Change’’ and SIDA “Power Analysis’’), which
shared the analytical perspective on accountability.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

7.      The original PDO was to contribute to improved access to judicial and legal
services and to the accountable and transparent use of public financial resources. This
was expected to be achieved by assisting the GoT in improving the skills and systems to
deliver judicial/legal services and public financial management, and strengthening the
capacity of oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIs) to perform their role.

8.     Progress on legal and judicial reform was expected to be measured by the
percentage of court cases outstanding for two years or more (Component 1). Progress on
public financial management by the percentage of MDAs with clean audit in the NAO


10
   The World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzania (2000-2003) focuses interventions in
four areas of strategic importance, including: private sector and infrastructure development; sustainable
rural development; improved social infrastructure; and public sector reform and institution building to
increase the effectiveness of public service delivery and improve governance. ATIP was closely related to
the last area since it supported reforms expected to have impact on both service delivery and governance.
11
    Other programmatic areas of reform – namely, public sector and local government reform – had
previously been the beneficiaries of Bank’s discrete project financing via Public Service Reform Project
(P060883) and Local Government Support Project (P070736).

report presented to Parliament12 (Component 2). Progress in strengthening OWIs by: (i)
the increased number of OWIs that use evidence-based reports in assessing government
performance in core reform programs, and (ii) the increased number of professional
associations actively promoting ethical conduct amongst members (Component 3).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.     The original PDOs did not change. However, at the time of the restructuring in
September 2010, the following indicator for Component 2 was refined: “Percentage of
Ministries, Departments and Agencies with clean audit in National Audit Report
presented to parliament?. This change did not have any impact on the original project
scope, and it was done to facilitate monitoring and tracking progress in PFM, and to
comply with the Ministry of Finance’s regulatory framework13.

10.     When the project was restructured in 2010, a revised set of intermediate indicators
was formulated in order to more effectively monitor the expected outcomes of the
project activities, and to better reflect strategic priorities identified in the two reforms
programs. More precisely, 1 new indicator14 was introduced for the LSRP (Component 1)
and 5 new indicators15 for PFMRP16 (Component 2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.    Given the nature of the project which focused on developing institutions and
systems both within and outside the government, the PAD did not specifically identify
the primary target group and broadly referred to Judicial and Legal Institutions
(Component 1), Public and Financial Management Institutions (Component 2), and
Oversight and Watchdog Institutions (Component 3). However, the PDO and key
performance indicators did indicate the target beneficiaries, which included the Ministry
of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MoJCA), the


12
   The original indicator referred to ‘value for money audit’. However, it was realized this indicator could
not be operationalized because value for money audits were few in number and only on-demand. The 2010
restructuring provided the opportunity to address this issue by modifying the PDO indicators.
13
   The original indicator referred to ‘value for money audit’. However, it was realized this indicator could
not be operationalized because value for money audit were few in number and only on-demand. The 2010
restructuring provided the opportunity to address this issue by modifying the PDO. This also explains why
baseline data are only available from 2009.
14
   New indicator was “increase in the number of beneficiaries of legal aid services?.
15
   The new indicators were: (i) Percentage reduction in the deviation of actual expenditure from approved
budget; (ii) Reduction in the number of days it takes for funds to reach MDAs and LGAs after receipt of
complete application for funds; (iii) Increase in the proportion of external financial aid channeled through
general budget support; (iv) Percentage increase in the number of public procurements completed using
competitive bidding processes; (v) Graduation of National Audit Office in the AFROSAI (Africa Regional
Organization of supreme Audit Institutions( grade levels).
16
   In the case of component 2 (PFMRP) new intermediate indicators were introduced to better monitor the
achievement of agreed outcomes of PFM reforms, and better reflect the move from an input-oriented to a
results/oriented reform program . This was also a major recommendation of the 2008 PEFA Report.

                                                     3
Ethics Secretariat (ES), and the Good Governance Coordination Unit (GGCU). Other
specific institutions expected to benefit from the project included the Controller and
Auditor General (CAG) and the National Audit Office (NAO).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.     At the time of approval in 2006, the project was a five-year Specific Investment
Loan (SIL) of SDR 27.9 million (US$40 million equivalent), with three main components
reflecting the key areas identified by GoT as critical to improve governance in Tanzania,
plus an additional component to support overall project coordination.

13.     Component 1 – Strengthening the legal and judicial system (total funding
US$ 71.3 million, of which IDA US$ 24.8 million) was designed to finance the
implementation of GoT’s comprehensive legal/judicial reform program – the Legal
Sector Reform Program (LSRP). Support to the overall LSRP was harmonized with
other DPs (including Canada, Denmark and Sweden) through a SWAp modality with
pooled funds. To achieve LSRP objectives17, this component was further articulated in
the following 6 sub-components or “key results areas?:

             (i)      Establishment of a harmonized national legal framework;
             (ii)     Increased access to justice for the poor and the disadvantaged;
             (iii)    Improved governance and administrative justice;
             (iv)     Improved skills and knowledge of legal professionals;
             (v)      Improved service delivery capacity in key legal sector institutions;
             (vi)     Program management, coordination and M&E;

14.     Component 2 – Enhancing public financial accountability (total funding
US$ 68.9 million, of which IDA US$ 10 million) was designed to support the
implementation of GoT’s third phase of the Public Financial Management Reform
Program18 (PFMRP III). Support to the overall PFMRP III was harmonized with other
DPs (including Canada, Denmark, DfID, Japan and Norway) through a SWAp modality
with pooled funds. The main objective of the programme was to contribute to an
enhanced capacity of the MoF to manage public financial resources in an effective,
transparent and accountable manner and associated improvements in the MDAs public
financial management capacity. PFMRP III implementation was also expected to result




17
   The LSRP’s overall objective was to improve access to judicial and legal services for all Tanzanians
through improving the capacity of selected legal and judicial institutions. This was expected to contribute
to the achievement of the MKUKUTA outcomes on governance and accountability, and provide the
enabling environment for private sector investments and growth. The LSRP objectives were also
developed in close coordination with the Business Environment Strengthening Program in Tanzania
(BEST).
18
   The Tanzania PFMRP strategic plan draws on the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), and the IMF’s Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) analyses and recommendations.

                                                    4
in a strengthened capacity of the CAG and NAO to effectively perform their oversight
functions. This component included 6 sub-components or “key strategic goals19:

        (i) Improved capacity in the MoF for sound macro-economic and fiscal management;
        (ii) Devolved decision-making and accountability for resources to MDAs;
        (iii) Improved predictability of resources to MDAs;
        (iv) Enhanced value for money (VFM) in the use of public resources;
        (v) Reduced dependency on external financing;
        (vi) Capacity for sustained improvements in management and program implementation

15.     Component 3 – Strengthening OWIs – (IDA US $4.6 million) was designed to
support the strengthening of oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIs)20, empowering
them to effectively hold the government accountable, particularly with respect to cross-
cutting reforms, [i.e., LSRP, PFMRP, PSRP, LGRP and NACSAP]. This objective was
supposed to be achieved through a wide set of initiatives, and in particular: (i) by
generating and disseminating high quality information on performance and outcomes of
government; (ii) by improving the capacity of professional organizations - in both the
public and private sectors - to raise the level of ethics of their members using self-
regulatory ethics mechanisms, continuing education programs and, more broadly, IEC
programs aimed at the public at large; and (iii) by generally improving the capacity of
OWI’s staff to perform their functions.

16.    Component 4 – ATIP Coordination (IDA US $ 0.6 million) was designed to
ensure effective coordination of the project components. Specifically, the component
financed TA, training and operational expenditures to strengthen and facilitate the GGCU
to perform its core coordination and monitoring functions for the good governance
reform programs (with a special focus on the NACSAP).

1.6 Revised Components

17.     The ATIP was approved in May 2006 and became effective in July of the same
year. Since December 2008, the project was in ‘problem status’ (implementation progress
rated MU), because most of the activities funded under component 1 (LSRP) experienced
substantial delays and slow disbursements. For instance, of the US$ 40 million loan, only
US$ 5 million (12.5 %) were disbursed by the end of 2008. Moreover, an independent
review of the LSRP – jointly funded by donors and GoT – carried out in 2009, concluded
that only two out of the six original components performed satisfactorily21.



19
   These key strategic goals were further broken down, in the MOU for the PFMRP, in 10 intermediate
outcomes, namely: policy analysis and development; external resources management; budget management;
treasury management and accounting; procurement; information technology services; investment
management; administrative support services; external audit services; and program leadership, coordination,
monitoring and evaluation.
20
   OWIs are defined to include state oversight institutions such as Parliament, PCB, NAO, the Ethics
Secretariat as well as non-state actors such as the media and civil society organizations.
21
   These components were (i) the establishment of a harmonized national legal framework and (ii) the
improvement in the skills and knowledge of legal professionals.

                                                    5
18.     The mid-term review mission carried out by the Bank a few months later reached
similar conclusions and recommended substantially reducing the scope of the activities
under Component 1, to ensure more effective use of the credit for the remaining duration
of the project. In line with these recommendations, three of the original sub-components
were dropped22, a new one was added, and two were revised. More precisely:

        a. Sub-component 1 (added): Increased efficiency in the administration of justice.

        b. Sub-component 2 (revised): Enhanced equal access to justice. All original activities
           were dropped with the exception of (i) design and implementation of a program to
           promote the expansion of national legal aid networks, and (ii) construction,
           rehabilitation and equipment of primary courts;

        c. Sub-component 3 (revised): Improved knowledge and skills of legal professionals. All
           original activities were dropped with the exception of (i) building the capacity of the
           Council of Legal Education to monitor quality of national legal education and (ii)
           construction of new law school for practical training/apprenticeship of law graduates;

19.     These actions contributed to the improved capacity of implementing agencies to
prioritize interventions and ensure effective utilization of the bulk of the loan. The post-
restructuring improvements in the PI ratings are consistent with this interpretation
(section 3 further elaborates on this point).

20.     Through the 2nd restructuring paper (Nov.’11) the total unutilized sum of SDR
7,700,000 (equivalent to approx. US$ 12 million) was re-allocated to other projects in the
Tanzania portfolio in the absence of any sound proposals from GoT to its use on the
ATIP sectors. Table 1 below summarizes the original and revised IDA allocation and
final disbursement (at project closing) by component:

Note: Million US $. Revised IDA allocation is post 2nd restructuring (2011). The total disbursed does not
     include the large scale commitment for the construction of the law school. Settlement is pending at
     time of submitting ICR.




22
  Namely, the sub-component ‘on establishment of a harmonized national legal framework’ and the sub-
component ‘on support to human rights and administrative justice and subcomponent on improved service
delivery capacity in key legal and judicial institutions’ were dropped.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.    The other significant change that took place was the extension of the closing date.
The project was expected to close in December 2011, but was extended until March 30,
2012. The extension, however, only applied to specific activities under Component 1
(LSRP), to allow completion of a construction contract for the Law School of Tanzania.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.    A key aspect of ATIP preparation process was the combination of distinct reform
programs (PFMRP, LSRP and support to OWIs) under a unified project entity. Several
reasons explain this choice. On the one hand, this was the result of the project’s explicit
alignment with the ‘holistic’ approach followed by the GoT in both the NFGG and
MKUKUTA. On the other hand, ATIP was operationalized in the slipstream of the
substantial, multi-donor supported, reform programs for public sector (PSRP), local
government (LGRP) and public financial management (PFMRP). These programs, which
were generating considerable early successes and strong momentum, were each
characterized by widely-scoped and ambitious work programs operating at many layers
and involving a large number of actors. Implementation was supported by considerable
teams of deployed staff and TAs (whether under PIU arrangements or not). In the case of
ATIP, the combination within a unified delivery mechanism (at the upper reaches) of
diverse sectoral activities foreshadowed complexities for project management and
coordination between components at the implementation stage.

23.     In particular, the preparation of the Legal Sector Component of ATIP – and the
SWAp it was supporting - had infused into it the same confidence for success being
exhibited by the other already up and running reform programs. In retrospect, the
difficulties experienced at the implementation stage (including the need to downsize the
scope of the activities under LSRP) suggest this over-confidence was probably misplaced.
In other words, the project design should have taken greater account of the sector-specific
challenges, better fitting the interventions to the realities (and weaknesses) of the legal
sector’s institutional framework. In this connection it was surprising that a legal sector
expert seemed not to be included in the project preparation missions.

24.     The quality of project design could have also benefited from a more careful
consideration of some critical lessons emerging from previous operations. In particular,
an earlier Bank project - the Financial and Legal Management Upgrading Project
(FILMUP) – had already followed a similar design, combining a wide set of
implementation agencies under a SWAp and covering the same institutions supported
under ATIP. The ICR for the FILMUP (delivered in early 2001) provided several
interesting reflections on what did not work as expected. For example, the observation
was made on highly restricted capacity of implementing agencies during the life of
FILMUP (though this had improved by project end). Furthermore, it was noted that the
original Staff Appraisal Report “did not contain systematic thinking with respect to a

                                            7
series of project themes including strategies for training, computerization or
organizational change?. Finally, the ICR concluded with a gloomy assessment of the
legal and justice sector in the late 1990s 23 , arguing that the substantial impact of
FILMUP was restricted mainly to a new consensus for development in this sector, well
below the original expectations of the project. All together, these findings were putting
into question the probability of the comprehensive and overly ambitious SWAp to
promptly deliver on institutional reforms.

25.     Besides previous operational work, several analytical studies carried out by World
Bank and other development partners would have also suggested a more cautionary
approach at the design stage. In particular, the political economy study commissioned by
the Bank in 2005 was stark in concluding that “although the judiciary should play a
central role in the extension of good governance and democratization in Tanzania, it is
unable to do so, because it has suffered from years of neglect and remains understaffed
and under-resourced?. Furthermore, the observation was made that “reform of the legal
system poses formidable leadership, administrative and financial challenges?, suggesting
at the outset that the ATIP design should have given due recognition to the substantial
challenges and complexity of the tasks to be managed in the LSRP.

26.     The project design, however, was not entirely defined by a replication of ‘best
practices’ in terms of SWAp and basket-fund aid modalities. On the contrary, it was also
innovative on one particular aspect, namely the effort to find ‘best fit’ solutions to the
persistent lack of accountability of public officers by embedding into the design demand-
side approaches to governance and anti-corruption reforms (component 3). This was a
significant effort to translate into operational practice the lessons emerging from the
political economy study of Tanzania (2005) and other analytical works commissioned to
inform the design of the intervention. Altogether, those studies consistently pointed out
the critical role of oversight institutions24 and the urgent need to improve the quality of
information available to citizens as a necessary step to empower them.

2.2 Implementation

27.     Implementation progress varied significantly across the components and sub-
components of the project. As discussed earlier, the project was classified in ‘problem
status’ since December 2008, when implementation progress was rated ‘Moderately
Unsatisfactory’. The 2010 restructuring was therefore fully justified by persistent under-
performance (in terms of low disbursement and delays in infrastructural sub-projects, as




23
   “This sector (even at the end of the 90s) faced pervasive crisis to do with poor incentives, information
and institutions….The justice system, particularly in the rural areas suffered from poor access, delays,
corruption, lack of transparency and legitimacy?.

   Likewise, the lessons from Tanzania Financial and Legal Management Upgrading Project (FILMUP)
also highlighted the positive contribution the National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA) had
provided in the improvement of accounting standards.

                                                    8
well as weak implementation capacity), as identified in several supervision missions and
especially in the MTR at the end of 200925.

28.     While delays in disbursements for component 2 were resolved by 2009 26 ,
disbursements for component 1 remained problematic for several reasons, including: (i)
the low capacity of the Project Coordination Office of the government’s Legal Sector
Reform Program (LSRP) to coordinate implementing agencies in financial management,
procurement, planning and budgeting, monitoring and reporting, as well as providing
technical guidance on the same; (ii) the weakness in the leadership of the legal and
judicial reform program to implement the institutional arrangements and thereby drive
the reform program; and (iii) the continuous delays in planning and implementing the
construction of judiciary infrastructure.

29.     The first restructuring exercise essentially involved a re-focusing of project efforts
(see para.18) on what could be realistically delivered through the existing implementation
mechanisms and in the available time that was left (which in the event was 1 year).
Requiring as it did the fullest consultation with GoT and DPs under the SWAPs, the
restructuring was drawn out. The March ’09 MTR triggered the consultations leading to a
formal meeting at the February ‘10 ISM where 17 actions were agreed on the government
side. Progress on these actions was considered satisfactory during the restructuring
finalization mission of late May ’10; then the restructuring paper was finally submitted in
September. Thus 18 months total for the entire process. Notable actions taken in the
wake of the first restructuring included (i) hiring of procurement and financial advisors at
the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, and (ii) appointment of an overall
ATIP coordinator, to enhance and support project management.

30.     The second mentioned action related to the persistence of the coordination
challenges associated with the implementation arrangements which included the GGCU,
the 2 ministries (MoF and MoJCA) and the oversight body (ES). Combined with
complicated implementation arrangements within sector agencies and poor internal
communication, implementation was affected. The appointment of the coordinator eased
matters but came too late to make a substantial impact.

31.      Further, the implementation of some project activities under component 1
remained slow. Proactively, the Bank had meantime been pressing for a timely execution
of infrastructure projects (Law School and 20 primary courts ) and the elaboration of
sound GoT proposals for the alternative use of any unutilized funds (signaled in the first
restructuring document with regard to $6mn saving on the Court of Appeal). Prior to the
second restructuring, it was evident that a) Law School construction could not
realistically be finished until March ’12, b) court building could not be contracted and
completed in timely fashion and c) a workable proposal for allocation transfer to the next


25
   . Following restructuring of the project in October 2010, implementation progress has improved from
unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory in December 2010 until project closure
26
    In the case of component 2, delays in signing the PFMRP MOU by GoT led to delayed disbursement in
the period 2006-2008 [see para 55 for further details].

                                                  9
phase of PFMRP had not been received. The second restructuring paper was therefore
approved in November ’11, which formalized a project extension to March ’12 (only
covering the Law School work) and a cancellation of SDR 7.7 mln.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     ATIP design explicitly recognized the need for an effective M&E system to track
progress toward the PDO and intermediate results, as well as to enhance learning from
the implementation process. Accordingly, M&E plans were embedded in the project’s
support to both reform programs (PFMRP, LSRP) through dedicated sub-components.
Various M&E activities, including data collection and analysis, were spread across the
implementing agencies, while the overall responsibility to coordinate and strengthen
M&E mechanisms was assigned to the Project Coordination Office (PCO) within each
sector. In addition, it supported the strengthening of the M&E functions of the GGCU,
including reporting mechanism to monitor progress in the implementation of the National
Anti-corruption Strategy and Action-Plan (NASCAP).

33.      With specific reference to the legal and judicial sector, the original M&E
indicators were selected to align with the Government’s overarching system
(MKUKUTA) and generally relied on proximate rather than direct measures for the
strength and quality of the legal and justice system27. Over time, a growing consensus
emerged on the need to improve the quality of the M&E framework and invest further
efforts in building the capacity to collect and manage data on judicial performance. In
this context, the task team pursued strongly in advising and assisting the government to
develop and use administrative data on the quality of judiciary system as a management
tool. Two critical milestones were achieved with the design and implementation of two
reports on judicial case flow information in 2008 and 2010, respectively 28 . These
initiatives have laid the foundations for a methodologically sound approach to data
collection and analysis, while also allowing more precise tracking of progress on several
initiatives covered under the LSRP. However, efforts are still needed to implement most
of the recommendations [See Annex 5, Table B].

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.   Financial Management. The financial management performance of the project
and implementing institutions has been rated marginally satisfactory on numerous


27
   This was especially the case for the critical dimension of ‘Access to Justice’. It is generally accepted the
concept encompasses much more than just engagement with courts and lawyers. Usually otherwise
included would be implicit trust in the various justice agencies of the state, possibilities for ready redress,
non-discriminatory treatment, simplified procedures and legal language. For what seem to be reasons of
tractability, however, proximate measures of ‘access’ were introduced as intermediate indicators (backlog
of cases and average time of case disposal together with extension of legal aid at the intermediate level).
28
   The two reports were ‘A study on the Status of Judicial Case Backlogs in Tanzania Mainland, 2004 to
2008’ and ‘Consolidated Annual Statistics Report of the Judiciary of Tanzania, 2008 – 2009’. The former
was jointly managed with the National Bureau of Statistics and was based on a sample of establishments
(courts). The latter was jointly managed with the MJCA and was based on a complete sample of all courts.

                                                     10
occasions during implementation, largely due to the project experiencing a slow and
disrupted flow of funds. Audit reports were submitted to the Bank on time with clean
opinion; Interim Financial Reports were also submitted on a quarterly basis, reviewed by
the FM specialist and found to be satisfactory. Project accountants under components 1
and 3 have demonstrated weakness in performance largely contributed by the inadequate
prior experience in Bank’s financial reporting and disbursement procedures. Component
2 performed better in this regard, in part due to the presence of a highly qualified
accountant who had worked in IDA projects before and provided adequate support to the
implementing institution. Whenever identified, shortfalls in capacity have been addressed
through training programs on financial reporting and disbursement procedures.

35.     A Financial Management (FM) supervision review was carried out as part of the
MTR mission in 2009, covering the LSRP basket and the special account under the
Ethics Secretariat (ES). The mission reviewed the accounting and financial management
aspects of the program (including staffing, budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds
flow, financial reporting and external audit), confirming disrupted flow of funds 29. In
addition, it was noted that an internal Audit Committee had not yet been established at
the MoJCA (as agreed under the LSRP MOU signed in 2006).

36.     Procurement. The MOF, the MoJCA and the ES had the overall responsibility of
implementing ATIP activities, including procurement functions. All three implementing
agencies established Procurement Management Units (PMUs) and Tender Boards (TBs)
according to the requirements of the 2004 Public Procurement Act. PMUs were
responsible for managing all procurement and disposal of tender activities except
adjudication and contract award while the TBs among other activities were responsible
for adjudication on the recommendation from the PMUs and award of contracts.

37.     Implementation regarding procurement has been rated moderately satisfactory on
several occasions during ISMs, and moderately unsatisfactory at the time of MTR. This
was largely due to the low staff capacity to prepare procurement plans, processing
procurement packages, managing procurement data and procurement activities. While
PFMRP had adequate capacity in procurement, this was not the case for component 1 of
the project (LSRP), which also had the largest procurement activities. In general, LSRP
implementing agencies under-performed on procurement functions. However, some
progress was reported in late 2009, when the LSRP was strengthened by recruitment of a
procurement expert. In addition, two contract managers were recruited to manage the
construction program for the law school and primary courts. In the case of component 3,
most of the procurement activities were for small value contracts, with only few cases
above the US $ 100,000 threshold. This allowed reducing the length and complexity of
procurement processes.




29
   This was attributed to the following reasons: (i) delays in the preparation of the annual work
plans/budgets; (ii) delays in the approval of the annual work plans; (iii) incomplete withdrawal applications
for IDA funds arising the from the lack of prior experience with the IDA disbursement procedures.

                                                    11
38.     Disbursement. The amount approved under the original IDA Grant was US $ 40
million equivalent, for which a total of 24.8 has been disbursed. As discussed earlier
(Para. 31) an amount of 12 million was cancelled following restructuring in 2011.

39.     Environmental Assessment. Environmental and social safeguards were
introduced to specifically address issues in the infrastructure sub-components including:
extension and rehabilitation of existing buildings; demolition of old buildings and
construction of new building. An environmental and social screening process was put in
place that would allow implementing agencies to identify and mitigate potential negative
environmental and social impact during the construction planning stage. Two framework
documents were prepared, namely: Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF); and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Subsequent supervision missions,
however, revealed low awareness of the framework documents amongst the
implementing agencies. Several measures were taken to fill this information gap and
enhance safeguards and environmental monitoring systems, including training of relevant
personnel and the inclusions of checklists to the contractors’ contracts.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.    The main challenge is how to build on the achievements of the ATIP and continue
supporting government efforts to move forward the reform programs. To this end, the
following streams of interventions are currently under preparation:

   a) Component 1: The LSRP continues until June 2013. MoJCA has received support
      from three donors (CIDA, DANIDA and the UNICEF) to conduct an assessment
      study whose main objective is to assess the performance of the legal and judicial
      sector towards achieving “timely justice for all?. This is a critical opportunity to
      reflect on the progress made and lessons learned from the LSRP implementation.
      The Bank is engaged in the supervision of the study, to be completed by 2013.

   b) Component 2: Dialogue is ongoing for the preparation of a new PFM project
      operating both at central level (MDA) and local level (LGA). This will be
      complementary to donor-funded efforts to support PFMRP IV. Bank-funded PFM
      operations are likely to focus on improving cash management and PFM functions
      across line ministries, as well as providing TA support to LGAs.

   c) Component 3: Building on Tanzania’s recent commitment to the Open
      Government Partnership and open data systems for improving governance and
      service delivery, an Open Government project is foreseen. The project will
      incorporate the lessons from ATIP and other operations, to ensure that relevant
      oversight agencies and actors on both the demand and supply side are actively.
      Also, dialogue is ongoing with state and non-state actors to carry out new PETs,
      building on some of the early experiences of PETs financed under ATIP.




                                           12
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

41.     The sectors of PFM and legal/justice, together with the advancement of the
integrity and accountability agenda, are core to the process of reform of state institutions
as conceptualized in key GoT documents (PRSP; NFGG). Likewise, the project’s
relevance – in the context of the respective SWAps – is emphasized by the considerable
gulf between the existing and the ideal-type institutional state in each of the sectors, but
most especially in the legal and justice sector characterized by several institutional
challenges.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

42.     In the circumstances of the ‘problem status’ designation for ATIP and the
prescription for restructuring attendant on the 2009 MTR, PDO achievement ranking
dropped to Moderately Unsatisfactory in successive ISRs. An improved trend on
implementation began to develop as expected meanwhile with the corrective actions
taken in restructuring and stronger efforts by key project actors. The PDO and
intermediate indicators at closure give a mixed picture only partially illustrating
successful completion.

43.     Component 1 scores rather well against indicators though its record of success is
checkered as evidenced by its substantial restructuring. Comment can be addressed on the
tractability and suitability of its specific indicators (see paras. 49 and 50 below) but the
target at PDO level was surpassed. That for Component 2 was close to fully achieved.
Despite delays in activation, the skills and systems building for better PFM accountability
and transparency has advanced impressively albeit some sub-component measures were
not attained. Component 3 on the other hand exhibits a very patchy record – and doesn’t
meet PDO indicators - reflecting inexperience with (and perhaps suitability of) the type
of instrument installed for OWI support. Finally, project coordination (Component 4)
had particular difficulties explained below which persisted to greater or lesser degree
throughout project life.      [Annex 2 should be read in combination with what follows to
garner a detailed record of ATIP achievement including at sub-component level]

Component 1

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

44.    This component represents the largest investment under ATIP, and perhaps the
most ambitious as regards the PDO expectations from a sector comparatively unused to
programmed, reform interventions. Discussions with Government counterparts during
the ICR mission confirmed that there was a firm commitment to respond to the reform
requirements of all the 15 legal sector institutions that were part of the original design of

                                             13
the LSRP. Indeed, the component’s genesis was in the significant analytical and
prescriptive work initiated by GoT in preparation for the LSRP (i.e. the Bomani report
and the deliberations of the Legal Task Force). Apparently, proposals for DP support to
LSRP went through several iterations before a version was accepted as one that could be
acted upon with some confidence, owing to the wide scope of the reform program. Even
at this point, however, project delivery capability appeared to be overrated.

45.     A ‘First Annual Review’ of LSRP was presented by a team of legal experts in
June 2008. Some particular observations of the 1st Annual Review either illustrate
significant design shortcomings in the LSRP which remain educative for the ATIP ICR
and/or they point to operational issues for the reform that persist to some degree,
including the following: (quotes are from the Review)

             Weak reform commitment can be ascribed in some cases to a lack of clarity
             on “what is exactly meant by the reform?.
             A gap in strategic leadership was identified as regards the activation of the
             reform by way of its participating institutions.
             Lead agencies didn’t have the money, staff or authority to coordinate the Key
             Result Areas.
             “If the LSRP were running at full clip the link offices would be overwhelmed?.
             Lead agencies are neither leading nor coordinating the implementing agencies.
             Training in change management was just ‘ad hoc’. It had no meaningful
             orientation.

46.     The discussion leading up to the LSRP restructuring, its approval and ensuing
actions did address some of the above with considerable implications for project work.
Notably the PS position in the Ministry was separated from that of Deputy Attorney
General 30 (action initiated by GoT in advance of the actual restructuring). Also,
operationally the Coordinating Unit received the benefit of TA. A new impetus was
provided to the reform effort impressively manifested in a heightened pace and focus for
priority activities. The civilianization of the prosecution function (outside the remit of
ATIP but under the broader LSRP), the advances in High Court records management, the
reduction in case backlog, the establishment of the cadre of court administrators, the
recruitment of staff for the Legal Aid Secretariat, are amongst real recent gains against
the PDO. Furthermore the Coordination Unit was growing in knowledge and technical
experience which in turn impacted project execution, notably as concerned more cogent
work planning in step with the mainstreamed budget cycle in MoCAJ, as well as better
monitoring and reporting.

47.    Despite this significant progress, embedded constraints to project execution have
remained. In particular, weak implementation capacity and project management


30
  Until then, the position of DAG and PS were held by one senior person, with the DAG functions
generally taking precedence. The government’s decision to split the two and create a discrete position of
PS allowed strengthening the concentration on project management, and helped to improve the strategic
focus of reform initiatives.

                                                   14
experience (especially on procurement) combined with poor coordination between
MoJCA and the Judiciary contributed to continuous delays in the implementation of the
activities. Moreover, the general difficulty with coordination has been exacerbated by
some situational factors, namely the constitutionally independent orbits of operation of
the two branches of government involved (the Judiciary and the Executive), as well as the
professional and academic entities. Finally, maintaining regularised meetings of higher
level committees proved challenging, given limits on the availability of members.

48.     The ultimate cancellation in 2011 of SDR 7.7 million (12 million US
$ equivalent) of the credit - related (largely) to changes in the construction schedule for
the project and failure to move the tendering process for the 20 primary courts31 - has had
the inevitable effect of diminishing project impact and undermined prospects of
achieving the PDOs, notwithstanding the significant acceleration and impact of project
activities reported in the last 2/3 years of the project cycle. Conversely, the bringing of
the construction of the Law School close to completion fulfills an impressive project
undertaking, with potentials for longer-term impact [albeit risks remain - see section 4].

49.      Increased access to justice specifically for the poor and disadvantaged lies at the
core of the anticipated results from the reform overall (sub-component 2 of the
legal/justice component deals with this). Overall delivery has been disappointing though
offset to some extent by some success in the broader spread of legal aid. Case flow
management committees for primary courts were abandoned. The extension of physical
access by construction of additional primary courts was severely curtailed for reasons
explained. There was limited translation and dissemination of basic statutes and the
elaboration of guidelines. The upgrading of paralegals received little attention. Finally,
although single actor views differ as to the place and usefulness in the overall system of
the ward tribunals, the PAD did list support for them (in tandem with the LGRP). This
support, however, never materialized. The restructuring of the project effectively cut
perceived losses on this sub-component by adjusting the ‘poor and disadvantaged’ slant
of the activities to ‘equal access’ and limiting remaining efforts to legal aid initiatives and
construction. This re-emphasis could be argued to provide better perspective on
improving the system overall rather than attempting to widely spread the effort. Even
with this, however, it must be said that the project indicators as formulated did not
convincingly lock on to the PDO stipulation of “improved access to judicial and legal
services?. ‘Backlog’ of cases (the PDO level indicator) is a limited measure, transposed
directly from MKUKUTA. The intermediate target for average time of case dispatch is
subject to shading and the target for increased number of legal aid beneficiaries was not a
real challenge to the system (and even so was not met).

50.    In conclusion, the monitoring of achievements under the component is vitiated to
a degree by the flaws in collection and questions as to the robustness of data (although
improvement in the quality of data collection and analysis have been reported since 2010).
For example, available data show a persistent downward trend in the case backlog since
2008, showing improving performance. This is also the case of the Primary Courts.


31
     Government has committed to construct 10 of the planned primary courts using its own resources.

                                                     15
However, the underlying explanations behind the reduction in (2 years or longer)
backlogged case numbers and average time for case resolution is difficult to penetrate in
attempting to illustrate causality. The information from the nationwide judiciary survey
(Annex 5) is also inconclusive as to other trends related to access to justice. For example,
three court levels (including primary courts) show an increase in pending cases overall
with three other levels showing the reverse. Meanwhile there is an actual reduction,
particularly in the primary courts, of the number of fresh cases filed.

Component 2

Rating: Satisfactory

51.    The World Bank financing for this component was activated only in 2009. The
MOU was a condition for disbursement, and delays in signing the MOU by GoT led to
delayed disbursement. This meant an entry to the sector at a time when basket funding
was long established and not without operational tensions32. The added delay occasioned
by the late finalization of the MoU luckily was not too disruptive as cash flows evened
out and the IDA allocation was fully disbursed by project closing.

52.      ATIP support to the PFMRP has been the most successful of the four components.
Legislative change under the reform was already bringing improvements in the
institutional framework for PFM (particularly as regards procurement and external audit)
in the period prior to IDA activation, This trend continued with an amendment to the
Public Finance Act (2010) establishing an internal audit function. Moreover, improved
use of technology including Macro-economic Modeling tool (MacMod), Strategic
Budgeting Allocation System (SBAS), Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) has improved fiscal forecasting, budgeting and budget execution across
government.

53.     Other major results have been achieved in the Accountant General’s department,
which has provided training to staff in MDAs and LGAs accounts departments to use
IFMIS and in relevant accounting and internal audit skills. The department has also
undertaken improvements in cash management across the public sector by upgrading
IFMIS. This includes introducing Electronic Funds Transfer (ETF) to regional sub-
treasuries and cash based International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) in
MDAs and LGAs. The government has also appointed an Assistant Accountant General
for LGAs in line with the PFA. These changes have led to improved cash management,
quality of financial reports and reconciliation of accounts.




32
  At the start in 2006, the PFMRP faced a number of challenges, as in the other components, including
procurement delays, inadequate attention by MOF staff to implement the program and weak capacity in
coordination and project management. To mitigate this, a senior PFM consultant was recruited to provide
technical support to the program, but his contract had to be terminated as he could not work effectively in a
highly mainstreamed program.

                                                    16
54.     PFMRP III support to the NAO has also led to timely production of annual audits,
within nine months after the end of the fiscal year, and strengthened the oversight
committees of parliament, namely the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Parastatal
Organizations Accounts Committee (POAC) and the Local Government Authorities
Accounts Committee (LAAC). Support to these committees has enabled them to expand
their oversight work to cover more accounting entities and to produce improved quality
reports to Parliament, thus strengthening horizontal accountability. Despite the number
of MDAs with clean audit reports presented to Parliament has registered a decline from
86 % in 2009 to 78 % in 2010, interviews with relevant counterparts during the ICR
mission suggest that those figures do not necessarily reflect a negative trend, but rather a
strengthened capacity of external audit services, which in turn accounts for greater
scrutiny of accounts.

55.     In budget management, government has developed a Medium Term Strategic
Planning and Budgeting Manual (MTSPBM) that guides MDAs, Regional Secretariats
and LGAs in planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Also the
Government updated its financial statistics by upgrading GFS codes from 1986 to 2001
series. Furthermore, since 2010/11 the Government budget system has been upgraded so
as to be able to report according to Classification of Functions of Government (CoFoG).
Furthermore, there have been improvements in aggregate expenditure outturns, although
within year variances are still significantly large.

56.     Despite these notable achievements, there are nevertheless major challenges that
the PFMRP has yet to address, as reflected in the PEFA 2009 report and, more recently,
in a memorandum prepared by IMF. These include the need to strengthen the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework given that estimations for the outer years currently are not
reliable. Another priority refers to the urgent need to strengthen cash management,
especially at MDA and LGA level33. Improvements are also needed to enhance budget
management and minimize arrears that have built up in recent years. Finally, enhanced
capacity building efforts are required in procurement and internal audit to ensure these
functional areas are staffed competently in MDAs and LGAs.

57.     The assessment of improved performance at the late stage of implementation is
shared by GoT authorities (Annex 7) and by the Donor Working Group (Annex 8),
although the latter seems collectively to remain of the opinion that coordination has had
significant problems both with GoT and intra-donor on occasion; consensus was
evidently not always easily achieved. Nonetheless, in the ongoing PFM dialogue with
government, the Bank presence as a leading contributor on direction and substance
remained prominent throughout, even prior to the 2009 activation of the IDA funding.



33
   The lack of progress at MDA and LGA level is worrisome, considering that an independent review of the
program back in 2006 (Schiavo-Campo et al 2006) already recommended a significant shift in the PFMRP
to move away from an exclusive focus on inputs, and be more strongly focused on results, including
‘external’ PFM functions in MDAs and LGAs Building upon the recommendations of this study, PFMRP
III included a new dimension covering MDAs and LGAs.


                                                  17
Another strong opinion that appears well founded is that training and capacity
development of beneficiary bodies - although absorbing a very sizeable portion of
expenditure - did not manifestly bring the efficiency gains hoped for.

Component 3

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

58.    Progress on this component has been mixed largely due to variable performance
of grants to CSOs. Despite being organizationally overwhelmed by the deluge of early
responses to the call for proposals under the Facility for Ethics, Accountability and
Transparency (FEAT), the Ethics Secretariat settled into its scrutinizing role with the
hiring of TA. The launching of FEAT was seen in project design as experimental –
something of a pump priming exercise for ongoing accountability approaches.

59.      Many of the early submissions to FEAT were unsatisfactorily compiled and
argued and even later the quality of proposals was variegated, though the refocus on
Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) in particular after restructuring has
strengthened performance. Making a definitive judgment on the utility of the investment
is difficult particularly as impact assessment of individual initiatives seems sparse. The
total grant uptake against the indicators has been disappointing however.

60.    There are some notable achievements: ATIP has provided four rounds of grants to
49 grantees including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), three professional association,
and five state watchdog institutions. In 2011, the component successfully supported the
Procurement and Supplies Professionals Board to strengthen ethics compliance of its
members (as it had earlier with nurse and midwife organizations). In addition, it has now
supported 12 CSOs to undertake simple PETS in local government authorities,
demonstrating the importance of this approach to ensuring accountability of public funds
and creating awareness amongst citizens of government expenditures in service delivery.

61.    Another distinctive feature of this component was the departure from a basket-
fund modality, IDA being the sole source of funding. This aspect of the project design
granted a larger degree of flexibility at the implementation stage, easing the task of
coordinating and managing activities of the key implementing agency (Ethics Secretariat).
Whether the component at all sits well with the 2 large sectors in the design is
questionable nonetheless.

Component 4: Project Coordination

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

62.    Overall ATIP coordination was entrusted to GGCU in the Chief Secretary’s office.
At the time of restructuring, this arrangement was assessed as not being efficacious
because of resourcing and working issues rather than in principle. The entry of the
Reform Coordination Unit into marshaling the cross program reform generally, together

                                           18
with an ATIP Coordinator being designated in GGCU were both corrective measures.
However, given the ATIP coordinator has only been appointed since late 2010, it is
difficult to assess how useful this was as a remedial measure.

63.    The ICR mission and feedback from GoT confirmed the new arrangements as
ameliorating the situation, though the GGCU continued to be perceived as under-
resourced for the task. More fundamentally, however, the question remains if there was
not a mismatch of coordination functions that should have been thought through fully
with GoT at the outset. ATIP has inherently a complex interactive character and its
optimal coordination was always going to be a moot issue in practice. Accordingly, the
choice for GGCU in the first instance might have been misplaced, given that body’s
primary anti-corruption focus and slender staffing. What best suited the needs of GoT in
macro managing its reform effort globally required the closest design scrutiny and
subsequent decisive resourcing.

3.3 Efficiency

64.     At appraisal, a cost-benefit and financial analysis was not carried out for both
component 1 and 3, because of difficulties in identifying and quantifying the direct and
indirect financial, economic, and social benefits, and attributing specific outcomes to
interventions. Financial Rate of Return was estimated for component 2 (Annex 3).

65.     During project implementation, funds were used with the view to ensuring cost
efficiency and best value for money. This was evidenced by the fact that all financial
transactions were fully verified before disbursements were made for the acquisition of
goods, implementation of local civil works. Also, the adoption of competitive
procurement procedures became important key tools for helping the implementing
agencies to adopt the least cost approach in the administration of their budget.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

66.      Several senior administrators interviewed for the ICR emphasized the success of
the ATIP in terms of providing financial/technical resources and operational direction for
the government’s reform intentions with regard to PFM and the justice/legal sector. In
the process of project implementation ATIP has also helped to confer legitimacy to the
role of oversight institutions of accountability through the newly established structure of
Ethics Secretariat. In fact – again reflecting interviewee commentary – much of the
project’s shortcomings can be seen to have been at least partially pre-ordained by the
overly-ambitious approach at the design stage, while the corrective actions taken during
supervision – especially at restructuring stage – helped to overcome some challenges,
establishing structures and systems that have the potential of longer term impact on
development outcomes.




                                            19
67.     In contraindication, however, and as evidenced in the foregoing component
ratings, achievement of the PDO and delivery on project activities fell considerably short
in terms of anticipated outturns in the case of components 1 and 3. This is offset by the
impressive progress on component 2 – though even there the RF targets were not met in
full – and there is insufficient counterbalance represented to allow an MS overall.
Reinforcing this assessment, it has to be noted that even following restructuring and the
new alignment of sub-components and indicators, specific points of concentration of
component 1 – support to paralegals, expanding and strengthening the legal aid
framework, strengthening CLE and construction of primary courts – were either far from
satisfactorily achieved or scratched (the primary courts).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
    Not Applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.     Several actors interviewed during the ICR Mission stressed that the reinvigorated
approach by MoCAJ to project management - since restructuring in particular - had the
added reward of heightening Ministry institutional development and performance more
generally. That is to say MoCAJ is now seen to be increasingly at the centre of activity
in the sector reform program. Much improved interface with related agencies (police,
DPP etc.) – though beyond the ATIP remit – including through such bodies as the Child
Justice Forum was evidenced in this regard. The Court of Appeal deputy Registrar also
cited the knock-on institutional development benefits of the ATIP, with moves on
professionalization of the Magistrate cadre and the passing of the new Court
Administration Act arising from the reform dialogue prompted through the LSRP.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.     At restructuring there was an assumption on the government side that a one year
project extension would apply on the entirety of ATIP. There was a formal
communication from the Ministry of Finance pursuing this point in June 2011. However,
as the ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ rating continued to be attached to the realization of the
project development objective this was not possible. 34 As a result, very little time
remained for GoT project management officers to accelerate work plan elements when
the finality of the closure date was appreciated.

70.    During project execution GoT decided to proceed with providing temporary
premises for the Court of Appeal pending the use of own resources for a greenfield


34
  At the time of restructuring, it was agreed that 1 year extension of the credit closing date would have
been conditional to the improvement in the project implementation rates (up to satisfactory). While the
rates for PI did improve between in the last year of the project, the improvement was not considered
sufficient by CMU to warrant an extension.

                                                   20
construction. This freed up allocated funds and there was agreement that the largest
portion of these might be committed towards the next phase of PFMRP. However, a
structured proposal to this effect was not received from the GoT side before the agreed
deadline.

71.     Regarding the judicial/legal sector, GoT had become convinced by a study
commissioned under the PPF that lower level court infrastructure was an area of dire
need and had proceeded with its own capital plan to either build or rehabilitate primary
courts, district courts and resident magistrate courts. It is regrettable therefore that
procedural delays led to the cancellation of the allocation under ATIP itself for a planned
20 primary courts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
[See Annex 5]

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

72.     There is a general perception that the results achieved in the legal and justice
sector are at risk and may suffer setback with the project closure and the withdrawal of
the Bank from support to the LSRP. The Bank has been the major financier of the LSRP
basket contributing US$ 19 million over five years (2006 – 2011), with other financiers
contributing US$ 27 million. The other financiers will continue funding the LSRP up to
2013. However, prospective financing beyond 2013 appears constrained as currently
committed donors are few and with limited resources (CIDA, DANIDA and UNICEF).

73.     Without Bank financing, it is unlikely that the construction of the law school will
be fully fundable by the government, due to the inadequate development budget provided
for the legal and judicial sector. Moreover, sustained benefits will only be realized by the
ongoing GoT commitment to the School’s agenda for excellence and its actualization by
the academic leadership in conjunction with the judicial authorities. In this connection,
the fact that the School has been able to fill only 20 of the 56 posts in its establishment –
given its placement within the ‘recruitment permit’ system operated by President’s Office,
Public Service Management – raises serious concerns. Actions are needed to address this
structural understaffing. The Council for Legal Education has a similar problem for
personnel and other resources to the extent that it is highly restricted in exercising its role
in regulating all legal training.

74.    Also, the practical impediments to legal access –solely in terms of physical state
and proximity of primary courts – remain daunting. While 1,105 PCs are registered, only
between 500 and 600 are in operation. Addressing this infrastructure shortfall in the
absence of a large scale cost contributor will be a major challenge.

75.    The case of PFM reform is different, as this continues to be a sector where
substantial commitments exist on both DPs and GOT side. GoT is in the process of

                                             21
completing the preparation of the successor program to the PFMRP III (ending in June
2012). Given the fact that financing is already granted by other donors, the Bank has
decided to discontinue the support to the basket fund and instead support the PFMRP
through separate projects. Additional efforts will be required to ensure timely information
flows within the PFM WP, to avoid the risks of overlapping activities.

76.     One positive added benefit of the project (component 3) has been raising the
profile of the ES in the public’s eyes. However, the ending of ATIP-funded FEAT
linked to the under-resourcing of the Secretariat will inevitably cause some deflation of
that profile, a factor which the Commissioner and senior staff drew attention to. This is
worrisome, considering that support to ES continues to remain low in GoT priorities [It
was reported that the Ethics Secretariat operational budget had remained flat for 10 years].

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

77.     Paras. 22-26 above depict the pertinent environmental factors at play during the
design period, notably the prevailing view for an omnibus project and the pressures for an
all-encompassing legal reform effort. In retrospect, a more cautionary approach on the
Bank’s part would have been indicated given the countervailing historical opinion.
Nevertheless, with regard to the legal sector it has also been emphasized that several
iterations of the sectoral approach were worked through with GoT and the DPs during
design. Also, with the totality of ATIP, the Bank was positively responding to the
planning perspective of the then Administration with its priority focus on reform. In
doing so, preparatory rigor and an inclusive approach were consistently applied.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The Bank was a major financier in both component 1 and 2 and also provided
technical support in overall supervision of these components. In component 1, the Bank
was instrumental in improving the quality of project implementation and led the
restructuring of the LSRP to make it more focused. This was well appreciated by other
DPs participating in the program. Under component 2, the Bank was the chair of the PFM
donor working group between 2008/09 and 2009/10. In this role, the Bank provided
leadership in the dialogue with government. During this time, intense discussions were
held on the quality and scope of PFMRP workplans, government leadership of the
program, as well as technical assistance requirement to achieve program outputs within
the DP PFM working group and between DPs and the government. Generally, the
dialogue led to improvements overall in the PFMR.

                                            22
79.    Supervision was frequent due to the decentralized staffing arrangement. While
formal Bank’s supervision missions were undertaken at least once annually, there were
continuous joint supervisions with DPs, taking place at least twice annually through the
Joint Program Implementation Review Committee of the LSRP and the Joint Steering
Committee of the PFMRP. In addition, there were frequent contacts and interactions
between government staff and Bank staff based in Dar es Salaam, contributing to ongoing
support to the project team. Between 2006 and 2008, on-situ supervision was guaranteed
in substitution of supervision mission. This arrangement was possible thanks to the
presence of the TTL in the field, contributing to prompt responses to requests from the
counterparts. High quality mission reports (Aide Memoire and ISR) were prepared, and a
comprehensive Mid-Term review was conducted during which implementation issues
highlighted and remedial actions (including restructuring) were agreed upon. A possible
discounting observation on the pattern of strong supervision is that corrective
interventions may have been in evidence earlier in the project cycle.

80.    Internal Bank handovers between TTL's and other Bank newcomers to the ATIP
were also quickly and comprehensively facilitated. The transition process was well
managed with adequate involvement of the subsequent TTLs in the Implementation
Supervision Missions.

81.     The Procurement and fiduciary team provided the appropriate support to the task
team throughout the entire duration of the project. On both programs, the Bank provided
procurement and financial expertise to the baskets. The Bank, however, could have
anticipated better the challenges associated with the procurement process.

82.      Information exchange between the Bank and the donors has been open, candid
and transparent, taking advantage of the regular (monthly) discussions at the joint DP
committees responsible for overseeing progress on both LSRP and PFMRP reform
programs 35 . On two occasions, however, the Bank deviated from the donor’s joint
position. In March 2011 the Bank rejected the 2009/10 audit reports of the LSRP and
PFMRP due to the poor audit quality without consultation with its partners. The other
occasion was the abrupt closure of the ATIP on December 1, 2011, which took
government and donor partners by surprise, since there was an expectation by all parties
involved that the project would be extended by a year.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.    Given the MS rating for quality at entry and the MS rating for supervision, ICR
guidelines (OPCS 2011: 37) requires overall Bank performance to be rated as MS.



35
  The Bank was the lead donor and thus chair of the DP group for the duration of PFMRP III. The Bank
team also played a major role in the LSRP in support of Canada, the DP committee chair.

                                                23
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     The strong resolve of GoT to push the reform agenda encapsulated in NFGG and
later in MKUKUTA, and to record rapid institutional returns, was positive and remains
so. However, the flaws at the margins of project preparation, implementation, M&E and
other elements remarked upon in Section 2 above, sprang as much from the
Government´s normative perspective and ambitious expectations as it did from the
Bank´s. Also, in later performance, GoT management control and co-ordination of ATIP,
both in its component parts and as a whole, was desultory with firm direction being only
periodically applied. As against this, in these cases when project shortcomings were
identified, the appropriate officials joined with the problem-solving approach and
supported corrective measures

85.     In addition, there were problems with FM and procurement activities under the
two basket programs, which led to pressure to engage technical experts to support
government staff. Whilst the government initially pushed back regarding the need for TA
in the LSRP, this was not the case under the PFMRP, and DPs had to seek higher level
intervention to enable a decision to address the implementation risks. Even with the
acceptance of such TA, there are concerns that the utilization of such expertise has not
been monitored closely and skills transfers may not have been as expected.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.     The lack of execution capacity emphasized consistently in the reviews,
supervisions and this ICR was a severe constraining factor for all implementing agencies,
to lesser or greater degree. This could hardly be otherwise in the context of the
developmental shortfalls which the project was essentially seeking to come to grips with
in the respective sectors. Moreover, the large number of beneficiary/implementing
agencies under the project (15 for Component 1 alone at outset) indicated overstretch.
The coordination effort absorbed inordinate amounts of time, in these circumstances. As
a result, there was a growing tendency for the agencies to lobby for funds and attention,
thereby potentially affecting the prioritization of project activities and the progress
toward achievement of the PDO. The separate agencies were fixated on getting their
portion of total resources allocated and gave scant attention to interlinkages and synergy
opportunities. An example would be the pre-occupation with the Law School physical
construction with less concern being given to cross relations with the Council for Legal
Education36 (CLE).


36
   The CLE is an institution that is entrusted with harmonizing and coordinating legal education in Tanzania.
It also has a primary role of accrediting advocates in public practice

                                                    24
87.     Despite this fragmentation of effort, the implementing agencies nevertheless
demonstrated commitment through the ATIP project life. As observed earlier in this
report, a persistent factor was the willingness of the agencies to learn within project
implementation and for performance to be improved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.   Given the ‘MS’ rating for both the Government performance and the performance
of the implementing agencies, ICR guidelines (OPCS 2011: 37) requires overall
Borrower Performance to be rated as MS.

6. Lessons Learned

89.      The benefits and potential trade-offs associated with the proposed aid
delivery modalities need full consideration at the outset. The Bank’s configuration of
technical and financial support provided with the ATIP was informed by two major
approaches: (i) SWAp approach to reforms, and (ii) the pooling of efforts, management,
finances and oversight through the mechanism of common basket funds. These aid
modalities had several advantages (donor harmonization, alignment with Government
priorities, etc.) and were conducive to a broad participatory process in the design and
selection of project components. However, they also presented higher risks to discrete
financing operations, as became evident when management failures in the executing
institutions appeared. These failures can be less amenable to remedial actions when the
overall programs are so broad-fronted, complex and supported by several DPs with own
priority interests. That the consultative process between the MTR and actual restructuring
(1½ years) was so extended illustrates the point forcefully.

90.     The combining of sectors in an omnibus ‘umbrella project’ plus the
multiplicity of implementation agencies pose additional implementation challenges
and increase transaction costs downstream. Not only was ATIP financing grafted onto
existing SWAPs (paras.13&14above), it also combined disparate sectors. While a
decision in this direction was deemed justifiable at the planning stage (para.23) it
unquestionably also gave rise to cross-project coordination difficulties which government
mechanisms were not best suited to deal with at least at the initial stage. Implementation
problems also arose as a consequence of management arrangements under Component 1
where the system of five ‘lead agencies’ overseeing 15 ‘implementing agencies’ quickly
became unwieldy, most of the latter being dropped from project involvement at
restructuring. With regard to Component 3 (uniquely funded by IDA), the issue is more
whether a demand-led funding facility is best placed within a project framework
bracketing also large and distinct governmental sectors. There may well have been an
argument for alternative financing through a trust fund arrangement.




                                           25
91.     Available commentaries and lessons learned through previous sectoral works
need to be carefully reviewed at design stage, to better understand the feasibility of
the proposed interventions and avoid over-ambitious targets. As noted in para. 25 &
26, a considerable body of knowledge on the legal and justice sector was available in
particular at the time of design. It is surprising that the weight of that opinion as regards
the challenges in the sector did not influence ATIP planning more prominently. As a
consequence, the over-ambitious tasks associated with bringing the legal/judicial sector
to international standards of functionality conditioned the real progress that could have
been realistically achieved under the 5-years’ time frame.

92.     The presence of top-level leadership with executive capacity and strategic
focus should be tested rather than too readily assumed, as their absence has
detrimental effects at implementation stage. The constructive impulse to mobilize
additional financing behind the government reform drive led to assumptions as to how
‘ready to run’ was the project design. As evidenced by performance in the ensuing 2/3
years, not only was capacity lamentably below the required level for successful execution
in most component areas, but there was also a manifest lack of project direction, strategic
planning, and leadership. As a consequence, many activities languished and there
seemed to be uncertainty as to how to prioritize and sequence them. The LSRP in
particular demonstrates this point. Project execution has benefited when the apex
leadership – as well as that for lower echelons of implementation – has devoted attention
to the strategic progress of the reform. Conversely, in the absence of interest or
involvement by leaders, implementation control has drifted.

93.     Procedural and budgeting problems should not be underrated. Another
particularly troublesome aspect of project management related to work planning in the
context of mainstreaming and integration with MTEF. Procedures were wrestled with
and in consecutive annual cycles considerable disbursement delays were reported. There
should be greater anticipation of the capacity preparedness in these situations.

94.     The choice to embed the specific conditionality of the MoU in the project
design is highly questionable, as its costs far outweigh its potential benefits. The
delay in signing the MoU on PFMRP not only had negative impact on the disbursement
rates (and project ratings) for 3 subsequent years, but also meant that the Coordination
Secretariat position was only filled during 2009. The added efficiency in project
execution since that time demonstrates that higher returns would be evident if the
incumbent was in post from project commencement. Accordingly, the ATIP emphasis on
the MoU as ‘condition for disbursement’ in the design might be questioned, as this choice
appears to have only added additional costs to project implementation, with no
observable benefits.

95.    The process of restructuring does not need to await the MTR but should be
conducted as soon as there are signals that the DO may not be achieved and/or the
IP has the prospect of being unsatisfactory. As referred to above, the attenuated
consultative process to restructuring may have been inevitable. However, warning signs
on the project came at an early stage including as regards tardy approvals of workplans

                                             26
and budgets; attendant slow disbursement; implementation bottlenecks; coordination
weaknesses and M&E shortcomings. In these circumstances restructuring would better
have been signaled even before the designation of problem status.

96.     Defining and managing a robust approach to ‘change management’ is
essential when dealing with complex institutional reforms, and can help to maximize
returns at implementation stage. Given the complex and difficult nature of cross-
sectoral public sector reforms, such a diverse and extended sector nationally, a robust
‘change management approach’ was required to galvanise participating actors around the
efforts for reform 37 . Amongst other things, this should have involved harnessing the
support of key champions within the system; making sure team building was prioritized
and resourced; devising a comprehensive communications strategy for involved parties
internally (over and above external IEC); leading regular, periodic assessments of the
pace and achievement of work plan items; likewise regularly judging the response and
continuing level of enthusiasm of participants to the reform. Such a concerted approach
was only evident to limited degree in the ATIP implementation mechanisms, and this
probably explains why many of the original expectations were not met. As noted earlier,
ATIP agencies did progress in the project life and were increasingly able to get to grips
with implementation issues at most levels. But returns could have been higher vis-a-vis
project outputs and attendant institutional development greater, had the ATIP focused
more attention on defining - and managing - a change program for the institutions
involved.

97.     The experience of ATIP shows that available project time at conclusion
curtailed activities. Accordingly, efforts should be made to increase flexibility in
extending project life. The formal project intervention through restructuring led
demonstrably to increased performance in most respects and acceleration of activities.
However, the delay in restructuring and the curtailment of project life adhering to the
original closing date inevitably meant underachievement on most project fronts.
Consequentially, the available time inter alia constrained the realization of the PDO. In
retrospect, it is evident that the lack of flexibility in extending project life was unhelpful
on the Bank’s part.

98.     The nexus of benefits to identified groups from the reforms needs to be
established in all cases. The experience of the ATIP also shows the complexity of
identifying in practice “what is meant by reform?. For example, the PDO had the higher
level aim of engendering increased access to justice, particularly for the poor and
disadvantaged, but the operationalization of the principle in terms of actual planned
interventions revolved largely around case flow efficiencies, promoting legal aid centers



37
   The process of institutional development can be understood as planned cultural change. Understanding
how extant cultures hinder or promote organizational change, what government expects in terms of
improved MDA future performance and what developmental interventions need to be made to pursue this
transformation, constitute the change management agenda. Implicit in the design of ATIP was the
expectation that the involved institutions would not only rise to the reform challenge in their individual
spheres of operation but that they would also have their performance strengthened at the same time.

                                                   27
and infrastructure (court construction). This could be seen as a restricted list that in the
process of measurement didn’t directly lock on to the critical dimensions of citizen trust
toward state institutions, and actual usages of legal/judicial services across different strata
of the population [on this point, see also footnote 18]. Furthermore - casting back to the
project’s initiation – the particular beneficiary pay-offs of improved access from
identified activities (and even the group appetite for access) were not laid out.

99.     Involvement of the judiciary in project implementation presents a special set
of problems. As remarked in para.50, the constitutional separation of powers gives rise
to particular coordination challenges in such a component (no.1) as this. Not only are
governing procedures different amongst the implementation actors but so also are
methods of working and accountability relationships. Of primary importance are efforts
to establish ownership of reforms in its purview by the judiciary itself and for it to be
actively involved in coordination.

100. Monitoring progress of project activities needs to be built more soundly on
systems and applied skills. The monitoring of progress of activities under component 1
(LSRP) substantially improved at the late stage of implementation (2009), when a rich set
of administrative data began to be collected by team of experts, in collaboration with
National Bureau of Statistics). The positive externalities associated with these efforts
confirm the benefits of building multiple partnerships across MDAs. At the same time,
the under-usage of such data during the life of the project suggests that in the future a
stronger emphasis should be made in developing the required statistical and technical
skills across the project’s implementing agencies, to facilitate a more effective
institutional learning. This is critical to ensure the data and knowledge generated by
research can be integrated into the decision-making process and guide sectoral reforms.

101. Funding of non-state actors can be time-intensive and requires careful
planning, with good information, clear criteria to guide the selection process and
hands-on monitoring. This is necessary to ensure that activities are well supervised and
strategically linked. The ATIP did not foresee this investment at the outset and,
consequently, the implementing agency (the ES) was overwhelmed by proposals in the
initial stages. Subsequently, more investments were made in tailoring the criteria and
providing information on the grant facility, although it is not clear what the ultimate
impact of the activities financed achieved and whether they have been sustained.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

102. The GoT presented its own Implementation Completion Report for ATIP in mid-
April 2012. A summary is appended in Annex 7, which provides a component by
component as well as summary assessment.

103. The GoT report shares many of the key findings of the ICR mission, including as
regards personnel and systems and provisions for strengthening these capacities. Strong

                                              28
observations are made as regards project co-ordination: “During the time of project
design the issue of project coordination seems to be not given priority. The modality of
coordination was not even clearly stated in the project document?. Further, the report
highlights the fact that each component had “its own autonomy? and “there were no
funds allocated for project coordination? militated against good coordination.

104. Mentions are made of micromanagement and “a lot of direct interference with
components on the priority of activities including lack of trust?. Also, “non-adherence to
MOU which led to ineffective dialogue?. In this connection, the interviews conducted
during the ICR mission indicated that the issue mainly related to the interactions under
Component 2 of the project (PFMRP).

105. Another notable entry of the GoT report relates to “delays in release of funds to
components due to a clause in the MoU requiring approval by JSC and different timing of
approving work plans and releases?.

106. Concerning Component 3 (OWI and CSO) there is the observation that “there was
no close supervision and collaboration by the Bank during the inception/entry point of the
project as a result the project took a long time before it could start. Even during the
completion of the project there was no smooth phasing out.? This relates to the abrupt
decision to close the project without extension, which had not been anticipated earlier.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 - Strengthening Legal and Judicial Reform

In the case of Component 1, there was significant adaptation of activities dictated by
Restructuring. To reflect this, the output situation is first presented to that point (4th
quarter 2010) on the original sub-components. Progress on the re-cast sub-components
then follows beneath.

Original Sub – component 1: Establishment of a harmonized national legal framework

The key outcomes under this component were (i) to improve the legal environment
for enhanced social justice and safety and economic development and (ii)
strengthen the capacity for research and studies of the national legal framework.

 (i)      Improvement in the legal environment for enhanced social justice and
          safety and econo mic d ev el op men t.

The Law Reform Commission of Tanzania (LRCT) collaborated with the Office
of Chief Parliamentary Draftsman (CPD) and updated some 46 pieces of legislation by
incorporating amendments and repealing outdated laws (official promulgation was a
further step yet to be completed in some instances). Some of the more notable laws
include (i) The Children and Young Persons Act; (ii) The Probation of Offenders Act;
(iii) The Minimum Sentences Act; and (iv) The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act.
Considerable progress was          made in updating and modernizing Tanzania’s
commercial law framework under the Business Environment Strengthening in Tanzania
(BEST) program, a five-year private sector development program funded by SIDA,
Netherlands, DFID, Denmark and IDA (through the Private Sector Competitiveness
Project). The initiatives complemented the LSRP activities notably as regards the
reviews of practices and procedures in the civil court system and the rules for the Court
of Appeal. Mobilisation of BEST funds was speedier in practice than those for LSRP
leading to a situation where the BEST facility was most drawn upon for the work. Some
stakeholder surveys and field studies were covered by LSRP however.

 (ii)     Strengthening the capacity for research and studies of the national legal
          framework

 Funding for this outcome was intended to strengthen the capacity of the LRCT t o :
(i) u n d e r t a k e technical s t u d i e s ; a n d ( ii) e s t a b l i s h a c o n t i n u o u s a n d
sustainable mechanism for reviewing the national laws through participatory
processes. The role of the LRCT is to identify laws that overlap, are outdated, or are
ineffective in meeting the nation’s development objectives. In order to further
strengthen LRCT’s analytical and research capacities through the implementation of
Phase III of the Capacity Building Project for the LRCT. This included a wide range
of retooling and training initiatives such as (a) career training; (b) training 10 state
attorneys on research methodology; (c) purchase of equipment and vehicles, and (d)

                                                   31
building the capacity of legislative processing agencies. This included training of
personnel in MDA’s who have responsibility for drafting legislation and regulatory
instruments.
The implementation of the Phase III program of work was delayed due to ongoing
consultations between the LRCT and the DPs regarding the eligibility of funding for
this program under the LSRP basket. However, to end of FY 2009/10, 24 staff had
received training and office equipment had been upgraded. In addition, the LRCT was
set to engage a study on which major bodies of law needed to be reviewed in the context
of the national legal framework. Otherwise, four lawyers in the Office of the Chief
Parliamentary Draftsman were trained in short courses for drafters and some office
furniture and equipment had been procured for the Office.

Original Sub-component 2: Increased access to justice for the poor and
disadvantaged

 (i)    Improved access to justice for disadvantaged persons.

Progress on achieving these outputs was very limited. The intention to establish
primary courts case flow management committees was dropped for want of stakeholders
who may be eligible for committee membership. Rather than change the criteria for
committee membership, it is regrettable that the idea was dropped.
Caseflow management committees exist at higher court levels, primarily in criminal
cases, where the presiding judge, prosecutor, defense counsel and the police
investigation team sit to review cases in court and how they could be expedited. These
committees are funded by the recurrent budget and are routine in nature. High court
caseflow management committees which in the past were no functional have now been
resuscitated following increases in the recurrent budget.
Other efforts on case flow management were deemed unsatisfactory. Procedures that
had been introduced in the past were not even adhered to and there had been no attention
to special guidelines and procedures for handling the cases of the disadvantaged. One
result is the languishing of accused in detention waiting the processing of their cases. In
the civil area, Alternative Dispute Resolution was under -utilized (other than at the
Commercial Court). One initiative that did get underway just at the time of restructuring
was the collection of data – by a 12 strong contracted task team – on delays in
adjudication on 300 civil and 200 criminal closed cases. A permit was also being
awaited to investigate pending cases.

 (ii)   Enhanced legal aid for disadvantaged and poor persons and dissemination
        of legal information.

Specific outputs in this area included: (i) assessing the efficacy for establishing a Legal
Aid Literacy Network and definition of modalities; (ii) drafting and adoption of code
of conduct and standards of practice for legal aid institutions; (iii) the establishment of
a Legal Aid Secretariat and launch of a Literacy Fund; (iv) establishment of legal aid
centers and the preparation of a training syllabus for paralegals and the carrying out of a
training of trainers (TOT) program; and (v) translation and dissemination of basic

                                            32
statutes and legal information into simple Swahili and Braille for lay persons and the
blind.
At the time of the 2009 Project MTR, implementation was seen as u n s a t i s f a c t o r y
mainly due to project management and lengthy processing time for clearances of
activities. In the absence of a Legal Aid Secretariat NGO activities were being
coordinated by the Tanganyika Law Society (TLS), which includes several legal aid
providers and a formal legal aid network, Tanzania Network of Legal Aid Providers
(TANLAP). This was only a stopgap measure but it persisted up to restructuring and
amongst other things stalled moves towards the establishment of a formal legal aid fund.
Agreement had been reached amongst NGOs active in the field to draft a code of
conduct and a consultant had been selected.

 (iii)   Improved access to justice to the rural areas.

 Ward tribunals function under the overall control of the district based local
government authorities and are essentially mechanisms which attempt to combine
informal principles (e.g. equity and mediation) with formal ones. In Tanzania, they are
supervised b y t h e P rim e M i n i st er’s Offi ce, R egi on al     Administration and
Lo cal Government (PMO-RALG), which is also the implementing agency for this
particular activity along with the Judiciary. However, since 2006 the PMO-RALG had
not been participating in LSRP implementation. It was only in February, 2009 that a
representative of the Permanent Secretary of the PMO-RALG attended the LSRP
Steering Committee meeting. Effectively, there was no progress on this front up to
restructuring with differences of opinion on the efficacy of the tribunals in the justice
sector corporately, being outside the court system as such.
Access of the rural population to justice was further constrained by the overstretch of the
cohort of available magistrates in servicing the 1100 + primary court centres throughout
the country, meaning that they had to travel distances, impacting efficiency significantly.
Building and furnishing adequacy was at a low level. The matter of underqualified and
underskilled magistrates continued to abide as did the question of remuneration.

Original Sub-Component 3: Improved governance and administrative justice

The LSRP under this sub-component was aimed at supporting the implementation of
the NACSAP, including: (i) promoting practical use of client service charters; (ii)
simplifying service delivery procedures; (iii) undertaking awareness programs for the
general public; and (iv) supporting the establishment of a mechanism for lodging
complaints against misuse of power or unethical conduct by legal/judicial institutions
personnel. The implementation progress of this sub-component is highly uneven. This
sub-component addresses a cross-cutting issue and each of the LSRP institutions is
involved in implementing it.

 (i)     Promoting practical use of client service charters.

Owing to the cross-cutting nature of this activity with the Public Service Reform
Program, the Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance (CHRAGG)

                                            33
which is the Lead Agency suggested that greater coordination was needed (i.e.
via the PCO) before they could proceed. CHRAA did progress approximately in this
area by preparing guidelines for lodging complaints regarding misuse of power and
unethical conduct and beginning the process of preparing jingles and radio spots for
dissemination, along with a soap opera called “Educatement?.

 (ii)     Coordinated and organized administrative justice system.

As mentioned above in respect of coordinating ward (and administrative) tribunal
activity with the court system, PMO- RALG had not been participating in LSRP
implementation since 2006 precluding any progress

Original Sub-Component 4 – Improved skills and knowledge of legal professionals

Specific outcomes under this sub-component included (i) provision of quality legal
training by legal education and training institutions, (ii) improved practical skills training
for law graduates, and (iii) improved capacity to offer continuing education programs.

 (i)      Provision of quality legal training by legal education and training
          institutions.

 Provision of short-term training in specialized skills was provided to 40 academic staff
 however, this was considered inadequate to enable them to provide such specialized
 skills training at higher level training institutions. Meanwhile, the a r r a n g e m e n t s
 processes in e s t a b l i s h i n g a permanent secretariat for the CLE, including finding
 offices and recruiting the staff were made. Research on standardizing the curriculum
 for legal training institutions had been completed. Generally, the long delays in
 preparing adequate work plans and procurement plans prevented the timely
 disbursement of funds to the implementing institutions in this area as in others.

 (i i )   Improved practical skills training for law graduates.

 The Law School has been established by law in 2007. During its first year of operation
 it had a cohort of 482 students. Another 300 were enrolled in the second year. The
 physical preparations for the construction of the new Law School lagged seriously
 however and the works contract was only signed close to restructuring. On the positive
 side, the strategic plan for the School 2010-15 was formulated and the School’s
 curriculum was reviewed together with four sets of rules and regulations.

 (iii)    Improved c a p a c i t y t o o f f e r c o n t i n u i n g e d u c a t i o n p r o g r a m s .


Progress in this area was limited to the provision of training materials and
administrative supports to training centers. The LSRP envisaged building the capacity
of high level training institutions to provide continuing legal education to law
graduates. The     training provided in specialized skills would have partly

                                                  34
contributed to this outcome. However, it was considered to be inadequate. . The TLS
considers continuing legal education a priority and has now made it mandatory for
members to take up specific hours of continuing education to meet membership
requirements.

Original Sub-component 5: Improved service delivery capacity in legal sector
institutions

The key outcomes included: (i) improved organization and support services for
effective service delivery; (ii) enhanced competence and motivation and integrity of
personnel, and (iii) improved working environment.

 (i)     Improved organization and support services for effective service delivery.

The main focus of this activity was promoting specialization in the court system;
however most of the work was undertaken not through LSRP but by BEST covering
the commercial and land court divisions of the High Court (including improving land
registries and MIS). The ATIP provision therefore became confined to allied
interventions such as training on Alternative Dispute Resolution (100+ judges and
magistrates) and data collection and management (80 judicial staff).

 (ii)    Enhanced competence and motivation and integrity of personnel.

This area was conceded to be largely within the province of PO-PSM so activities
became limited to connected training e.g. on registration of marriages, births etc. for
district officials and support to the African Regional Women Judges’ Conference.

 (iii)   Improved w o rkin g env i ron men t.

None of the major civil works, i.e., the Court of Appeal, the Law School, the MOCAJ
Headquarters building and the High Court Centers was underway at restructuring
although the contract for law school construction had finally been awarded. Furthermore,
only three primary courts had been constructed and four rehabilitated under LSRP and
there had been concern expressed on the level of supervision on these works. As regards
the planned batch of 20 additional primary courts only the consultant supervision
contract had been signed and clearance was pending. Overall at restructuring there
remained serious concern for the utilization of provided resources, works supervision
and the timely execution of contracts...

Original Sub-component 1 . 6 :      Program management, coordination, and
monitoring and evaluation

At the time of the MTR, the PC O and lead implementing agencies (LIAs) identified
some bottlenecks to the implementation of the LSRP with respect to management
and coordination arrangements. These included (i) understaffing in the PCO in
relation to the number of activities that were being implemented and their role in

                                           35
guiding and supporting LIAs. (ii) incentives for staff working in the PCO, (iii)
monitoring and reporting skills, and (iv) cumbersome dialogue structure for the LSRP
(e.g. perceived overlap between Joint Implementation Review committee (JIPRC) and the
Technical Coordination Committee (TCC); and (v) delayed approval of plans and
disbursements.

Also highlighted was the fact that mid-way through implementation, there was little
attention paid to monitoring the achievement of agreed outcomes and intermediate
outcomes. The shortcomings of coordination were adverted to again at the time of the
end-2010 ISM.

The drafting of a legal sector policy was cited as an accomplished activity at the time of
the MTR but subsequently, and up to restructuring the policy had not received cabinet
approval. Indeed the Minister had referred the draft back for further consultation.

 As a consequence of the restructuring document approval (Nov.2010), the Component
 1, ATIP sub-components were reduced in number by three and re-designated as below.
 Narrative on progress in the subsequent project period follows.

New sub-component 1: Increased efficiency in administration of justice and provision of
TA and training for improving case and records management.

Responding to earlier supervision comments on the lack of progress on case flow
management MoCAJ continued with the employment of 16 law graduates to collect
case flow data in the High Court, Dar as Salaam Zone alongside four judiciary staff (2
magistrates and 2 IT personnel) and guided by the report of the (BEST) TA Senior
Legal Adviser on best practice. The intended deliverable is a continuing data update
and case flow analysis mechanism (expected end June 2012).
In parallel, the 2010 Annual Statistics Report of the Judiciary was produced in a
collaborative exercise with the National Bureau of Statistics in late 2011. This
significant work in developing an established annual survey method (and related
directly to the ATIP PDO indicator on case backlog) is presented in Annex 5.

The High Court centre in Dar es Salaam was selected as a pilot for records management
upgrading of the court system under LSRP. All registry areas in the High Court
buildings were under renovation. Old and obsolete files were being purged in
accordance with standing regulations (by judiciary staff again assisted by contracted
graduates) and a new color-coded, terminal digit filing system is being installed for
current files. Bar coding hardware and software has been procured.

 New sub-component 2 (a): Design and Implementation of a Program to promote and
 monitor the Expansion of a Legal Aid Network.

Additional impetus was provided in the post-restructuring period for the expansion of the
nascent legal aid system. This area remains one of real need. As identified most recently

                                            36
by the report on a ‘Baseline Survey on Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar for a Legal
Services Facility’ (March 2012), although there is a strong legal basis for legal aid there
is “no systematic referral? nor is it clear “who should ensure that (it) is provided?. The
patchwork of support provided by NGOs with support funding is important in itself but
still severely limited with some geographic zones not reached. In this context, agreement
in early 2011 on the establishment and staffing of a Legal Aid Secretariat is a step
forward after a previous lack of agreement to proceed and corresponds to the start up of
the LA facility (additionally funded by DANIDA). The Secretariat will amongst its
priorities promote the formal recognition and upgrading of paralegals. The holding of
‘Legal Aid Day’ further promoted the extension of the system with the participation of 14
LA providers and 220 advocates in 10 regional centres.

New sub-component 2(b): Construction, rehabilitation, equipping of primary courts.

As noted in para.51 of the main report, procurement delays precluded the award of
contracts on the courts. Government has committed to making own funds available to
complete 10.

 New sub-component 3: Improved knowledge and skills of legal
 professionals.

 The Permanent Secretariat for the Council of Legal Education was operationalized
 finally in the period and its affairs began to be more systematically disposed of
 including addressing the backlog of petitions from law graduates to enter private
 practice. CLE has still a distance to go, however, in professionally regulating all legal
 training as it is assigned to do under the Advocates Act.

 Construction of the Law School complex accelerated after the eventual award of
 contract. The main buildings – admin. block; teaching block; multipurpose hall –
 were proceeding in parallel. On the visit to the site during the ICR mission the
 progress was confirmed – despite recent delays due to site flooding - though the
 claim that within a further week 95% of construction would be complete was doubted.
 Completion had been predicated on the ability to absorb $1mn per month in
 construction requirements up to the deadline. In pressing for the maximum
 completion before ATIP end, the mission was reassured to some degree by the close
 attention of the architect/supervisor who reported that he had conducted 17 formal
 site inspections. Though the move into its new premises is pending, the School has
 continued to upgrade its teaching approaches both as regards class and field work.
 There is a new emphasis on learning by doing for students through court simulations
 etc.     Faculty members have meanwhile benefited from international course
 attendance.

Component 2 – Enhancing Public Financial accountability (PFMRP)

This component aimed at supporting the implementation of the government’s Public
Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) phase III in collaboration with other

                                            37
DPs. Progress in PFM has been mixed but generally positive, as described in detail in the
following sub-components.

Sub-component 2.1: Improved capacity in the MoF for sound macro-economic and fiscal
management

At the start of the program, Tanzania’s MOF had begun a process of consolidating the
debt management function under the MOF and improved fiscal forecasting. This
function had previously been fragmented and undertaken by multiple agencies, including
the Bank of Tanzania, the Treasury Registrar, Tanzania Revenue Authority as well as the
MOF Commissioner for Policy Analysis. In the context of the increased role of the
MOF in fiscal management, the government undertook capacity building activities in the
Commissioner for Policy Analysis to strengthen Fiscal Policy, Research capacity and
debt management functions.
The overall objective was to improve decision making that is well informed by the
country’s macro-economic variables and forecasts through (i) strengthening macro-fiscal
forecasting and policy development capacity to achieve a more reliable and sustainable
macro-economic framework; (ii) establishing sound debt policy formulation and effective
debt management practices; (iii) establishing appropriate domestic revenue policies and
legal instruments and tight institutional links within MOF and between MOF, TRA and
Attorney General’s departments; and (iv) enhancing an appropriate expenditure
framework.
PFMRP helped establish the Debt Management Unit in the Office in the Accountant
General, provided funding for consolidation of the various debt and guarantee databases,
funded training for AccGen staff on CSDRMS (Commonwealth Secretariat Debt
Recording Management System) and funded the link between CSDRMS and IFMIS so
that data could be exchanged in an effective manner. This helped address one of the key
fiscal risks that MOF had faced in the past.

Sub-component 2.2: Devolved decision-making and accountability for resources to
MDAs

Under this sub-component, the PFMRP aimed at (i) improving the capacity of MDAs in
public financial management and (ii) ensure that MDAs are accountable for the public
financial resources they manage. This component provided support for improving the
operation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) at the
Central Government level, for rolling it out to the 21 Regions as well as the 20 Sub
treasuries located around the country. On an annual basis PFMRP provided training to
around 3000 Government staff on IFMIS operations. Use of the IFMIS devolved
payment authority to Line Ministries and they were fully accountable for use of their
budgets through the functionality provided by the IFMIS system. Funding provided by
PFMRP was used for upgrading of the IFMIS servers in the Office of the Accountant
General and training provided using PFMRP funds was used for moving towards making
Electronic Fund Transfers (EFTs) and fully automating the bank reconciliation process,
major achievements that happened over the last two years. The upgrade has led to a more
stable system that has few outages than in the past years. It has also enabled timely

                                           38
reconciliation of funds balances. The MOF is now rolling out the Tanzania Interbank
Settlement System (TISS) to sub-treasuries and LGAs and will enable large funds
transactions to be handled through banks. Support provided to IFMIS by PFMRP has led
to improved internal controls, better budget management, improved reporting, better bank
reconciliation, and improved cash management.
PFMRP also provided funding to the Office of the Accountant General of Zanzibar that
enabled the introduction of the Epicor IFMIS system in Zanzibar. This is now used for all
government payments in Zanzibar.
On the mainland, with a view to strengthen devolved decision making to Line Ministries,
PFMRP provided financial support to five Line Ministries. The Ministry of Education
was provided support for undertaking expenditure tracking, for establishing asset
registers in schools, for building the capacity of College Board Members and for
upgrading facilities at 68 Service Delivery Centers. The Ministry of Health was financed
for rolling out a system for revenue sharing arrangements in hospitals, for introducing a
risk management system in all spending units and for massive training of their stay on
International Public Sector Accounting Standards and IFMIS. PMORALG was one of the
biggest recipients of support from PFMRP III. This Ministry was provided support for
rolling out IFMIS to Local Governments that were not covered by IFMIS, for setting up a
completely modern IFMIS training facility in Dodoma, for establishing connectivity with
Local Governments for IFMIS and for upgrading the IFMIS version to 9.05 that is web
enabled. PFMRP funding was also used by PMORALG for training staff for introducing
the IPSAS Accrual Accounting Standard in Local Governments in 2009.
PFMRP funding has also been used for improving cash management in local
governments. Up to 2008 around there were 36,409 government accounts maintained at
17 commercial banks, with balances of TSH 637.8 billion and US$ 25.7 million. Of
these, 34,855 were maintained at the National Microfinance Bank (NMB). The
Accountant General’s (ACCGEN’s) office noted that approximately 14,000 of these were
individual primary school accounts. Following stakeholder discussions, MOF took a
decision to close these accounts and to retain only six at LGA level. These include
development expenditure, salaries, other charges, road funds, miscellaneous deposits and
own source revenue accounts. PFMRP funding was used by the Office of the Accountant
General in training local government staff in improved cash management practices for
supporting this change over.
Not just on the expenditure side, but on the revenue side, PFMRP provided support to the
Ministry of Lands and Housing for demarcation of plots in Dar to improve property tax
collections and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism was provided support for
automating its 20 tax collection centers across the country.
PFMRP provided extensive support for improving accountability of resources in MDA’s.
It provided the seed capital for helping establish the Institute of Internal Auditors of
Tanzania (as a branch of IIA Global that is the standard setter in this area), it provided
funding for regional learning through involving internal audit staff in Tanzania to
exchange views with their counterparts in Kenya that have one of the strongest internal
audit offices in Africa, and then it provided support for helping establish the Office of the
Internal Auditor General of Tanzania, on the same lines as the office in Kenya through an
amendment to the Public Finance Act, 2004.



                                             39
The Accountant General’s Department has undertaken recruitment exercise to strengthen
accounting departments in MDAs and LGAs. This has been coupled with extensive
capacity building. In 2010/11 alone, the department recruited 600 accounting graduates
to various posts in the government. PFMRP funds have been used for training these
newly recruited staff.
PFMRP has also provided funding for systemic improvements in financial management
from a capacity building and training perspective. There are three financial management
schools that are currently under MOF. These are the Institute of Financial Management,
Dar es Salam, the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, Arusha, and the Tanzania
Institute of Accountancy, Dar. These three institutes are used by MOF for in service
training as well for recruitment of new staff. These three schools were provided funding
by PFMRP for upgrading their IT infrastructure (e.g. 400 computers were provided to
IFM) as well as for revamping and upgrading their library facilities. IAA Arusha was also
supported by PFMRP for setting up a network throughout the campus. Besides these
three MOF training schools the primary regulator for the accountancy profession – the
National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA) was provided support from
PFMRP for upgrading its facilities for outreach to the profession in Tanzania through
running seminars on topics such as IFRSs that have now become mandatory in Tanzania.

Sub-component 2.3: Improved predictability of resources to MDAs

This sub-component aimed at improving predictability of resource flows by strengthening
the budget process and in particular ensuring stronger links between the MTEF and the
MKUKUTA. As part of this component, the government has improved the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) by updating the Macroeconomic Modeling Tool
(MACMOD) for projection of macro-economic variables and building capacity on
financial programming and projections; the tool for resource allocation - Strategic Budget
Allocation System (SBAS) and the Planning and Reporting (PLANREP) for LGAs.
Expenditure tracking and performance monitoring mechanisms have been instituted and
institutional arrangements are in place to conduct periodic follow-up of funds disbursed
for budget execution including inspection of projects. Government has also reclassified
the budget from GFS 1986 to GFS 2001.
The government developed a Medium Term Strategic Planning and Budgeting Manual
(MTSPBM) that guides MDAs, Regional Secretariats and LGAs in planning, budgeting,
monitoring, evaluation and reporting. The key documents include the Planning and
Budgeting Guideline (PBG), the budget speech; the estimate books and the background
to the budget and medium-term framework (BBMTF).
Despite the development of these tools, there are still significant challenges to be met.
The 2011/12 Rapid Budget Analysis reports that “the link between the MKUKUTA II
and the budget through the SBAS remains weak. While SBAS allows some tracking of
broad MKUKUTA categories to budget allocations, it does not offer a systematic
strategic linkage between allocations and MKUKUTA components. In particular, the
congruence between the MKUKUTA targets and the proposed activities in the budget is
vague, and the objective codes are not fully consistent cross MDAs, or over the years,
making comparisons difficult. In addition policy focus of the budget is significantly
undermined by lack of realism in strategic plans of the MDAs, excessive focus on detail

                                           40
in preparation of MDA budgets and lack of attention to outer years in the MTEF. These
challenges are being addressed in the next phase of PFMRP.

While MOF has by and large met the annual funding requirements in line with approved
budget for MDAs and LGAs, in recent years, cash management has emerged as major
challenges for MOF. There has been an increasing mismatch between revenue inflows
and expenditure demands due to which there has been reduced predictability regarding
flow of resources to spending units. This has adversely impacted the effective
implementation of programs by MDAs and LGAs.

Sub-component 2.4: Enhanced value for money (VFM) in the use of public resources

Accountability and oversight bodies have been major beneficiaries of PFMRP funding
during the period 2006 to 2011. National Audit Office has consistently received
substantial funding annually that has been used for infrastructure improvement (IT
equipment, transport), for large scale training, and for professionalization of the audit
task. This area of PFMRP support has been so successful that NAO Tanzania was elected
the Chair of Afrosai E (an association of 24 audit offices in Africa) in 2010 and was
elected as the auditor for the UN in 2011. It has achieved Level 3 of Afrosai E and is in
the top tier of audit offices in Africa. The preface of every annual audit report since 2007
has acknowledged the contribution of PFMRP for professionalization and strengthening
of the office. Strengthening the office has not only led to improved annual audits, but has
also led to the establishment of a special unit in NAO Tanzania that is focused on
performance and Value for Money audits. In 2011 NAO Tanzania was awarded the
annual prize for producing the best VFM Audit report in Africa by Afrosai E.

Through a deliberate strategy, PFMRP helped build stronger links between the NAO and
the Accountability Committees of Parliament. In 2008 PFMRP was extended to cover
support for the three Accountability Committees of Parliament. A deliberate decision
was taken to house the funding for these Committees with NAO. These three
committees are: Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Parastatal Organizations Accounts
Committee (POAC) and the Local Governments Accounts Committee (LAC). Funding
provided by PFMRP enabled these committees to undertake field visits – something that
they had never done in the past due to lack of funding and it enabled them to prepare
accountability reports of their own and utilize the media extensively to report on their
findings. PFMRP funding was also used by these Committees to host Annual
Accountability Conferences that discussed topical issues concerning financial
malpractices in state owned enterprises, in MDAs and Local Governments. PFMRP
funding was the catalyst for building stronger links between NAO and Parliament. A
special report prepared in 2011 for the Busan Aid Effectiveness meeting on
Accountability has given several examples from Tanzania, including the practice of
Annual Accountability Conferences, as global best practices.

The reports of these committees have been used to inform the National Assembly on the
probity of public financial management in government and have generated increased
calls for improved accountability of the executive. The increased oversight role of

                                            41
parliament on PFM was evident in the recent review of the NAO audit reports for the
year 2010/11 by the parliament that led to sacking of seven cabinet ministers in May,
2012. The NAO audit report and reports of parliamentary oversight committees cited
significant discrepancies in the management of public funds in seven ministries
including Finance, Energy and Minerals, Natural Resources, Regional Administration
and Local Government, Health and Social Welfare, Transport, and Industry and Trade.
These discrepancies and the heated debate in parliament led to the President’s decision
to reshuffle the cabinet.
Substantial PFMRP funding was also provided every year to support the Public
Procurement Regulatory Agency (PPRA). PPRA was provided funding for training
around 2000 staff from procuring entities, for capacity building for its own staff, for
carrying out audits of procuring entities, for developing and rolling out the procurement
and contract management system across the country and for critical studies such as the
feasibility study on e-procurement. Over the last six years, with extensive support from
PFMRP, PPRA has evolved as a pillar supporting accountability and value for money in
Tanzania. In fact, a PPRA report on TANESCO in 2008 was a crucial element in the
events that led to the dismissal of the Government and the Prime Minister in the
Richmond Case. PPRA is on the forefront of supporting analysis into Value for Money
on an annual basis and its reports are now summarized in a separate chapter in the
Annual Audit reports of the Auditor General.

A summary of the audit performance of MDAs in 2010/11 is shown in the table below.

While the number of MDAs with unqualified audits declined in 2009-10, this showed
improvement in 2010/11, the final year of the project. This improvement reflects efforts
to respond to the earlier year’s audit. Nevertheless, this has not stopped parliament from
addressing significant public financial management discrepancies in specific ministries as
cited above.
Exactly the same as in the Mainland, PFMRP funding has been provided for supporting
the Office of the Auditor General of Zanzibar and it has also been provided for
supporting the Accountability Committees of the Parliament of Zanzibar (Barazza). This
has positively impacted more informed public debate and improved accountability in
Zanzibar.


                                                 42
Sub-component 2.5 Reduced dependencies on external financing

The government under the PFMRP aimed at improving management of external aid funds
so as to increase development impact. This was to be undertaken by (i) increasing the
amount of external aid channeled through the exchequer, (ii) improving aid coordination
through formulating a Joint Assistance Strategy for development partners, and (iii)
enhancing access to information on aid flows by establishing an aid management
platform.
According to the Paris Declaration Survey led by UNDP, in 2010, 79% of aid to the
government sector of Tanzania used country PFM systems, improving from 66% and
71% registered in previous surveys in 2005 and 2007. The resources that are now being
channeled through the exchequer have increased significantly, and in addition, there has
been improved aid coordination. However, attempts at formulating a joint assistance
strategy have not been fruitful. In 2006, DPs formulated a three year joint assistance
strategy (JAST), but it proved to be a complicated exercise and since the JAST ended in
2009, most DPs have reverted to their own strategic planning approaches.
An aid management platform has now been established and is functioning at the MOF.
The system is populated annually prior to the budget and has provided useful inputs to
the government budget to forecast DP disbursements.

Sub-component 2.6: Capacity for sustained improvements in management and program
implementation

Government has strengthened the leadership of the PFMRP by mainstreaming most of the
work to existing MOF departments and ensuring MDAs and LGAs undertake activities
using existing structures. The PFMRP is led by a deputy PS in the MOF and supported
by the department of planning. Component managers of the PFMRP are directly
responsible for the implementation of the respective program areas. However, a program
implementation unit still exists to provide technical support to the respective
implementing departments and to enhance reporting and fiduciary functions related to the
PFMRP. This unit will be sustained in the next PFMRP IV program that is expected to
start in July 2012.

Component 3 - Support to strengthening Oversight and Watchdog Institutions.

 Sub-component 1: Facility for Ethics, Accountability and Transparency

   (i)     Generation and dissemination of quality information.

In the early period of its implementation responsibility, the Ethics Secretariat considered
itself hampered by a combination of a lack of experience with operating a grant facility
(including Bank procedures) and building public awareness of the aims of FEAT, the
demand driven emphasis of the facility led to a large volume of generally low quality
submitted applications from organisations whose ‘bona fides’ had in the first instance to
be checked. It appears the case that the Bank underestimated the lack of capability for
the task at the ES and did not appreciate the requirement for capacity building until well

                                            43
into project life. When appropriate interventions were made with the mobilisation of TA
and the provision of advice from the Bank, scrutinising capability increased and potential
beneficiaries were oriented to better practice. In the four rounds of calls for applications,
535 were received and ultimately 45 approved. 80% of grantees were Civil Society
Organisations from 15 of the Tanzanian regions. While in the first 2 rounds there was a
strong presence of good governance dissemination projects and organisational good
practice, in the third and fourth rounds there was a concentration on PETS projects
undertaken by 12 CSOs in 8 regions on recommendation of the Bank. The PETS usefully
uncovered spending leakages in public service delivery in several instances that were
publicly brought to light. The overall achievement against the PDO remained severely
curtailed however.

(ii) Improvement in the ethics of members of professional associations.

Grant approvals for organisations in this area were largely in the first two rounds of
FEAT. Examples were the Tanzania Procurement and Supplies Board, MEWATA – the
Tanzania Medical Women’s Association and TNMC - Tanzania Nurse and Midwife
Council. MEWATA’s project which probed ethical misconduct and TNMC’s which
aimed to include ethics modules in the training curricula were adjudged successful but,
again, overall impact of the sub component was more limited than expected

Sub-component 2: Ethics Secretariat Capacity Building

FEAT supported the training of ES staff from different departments of the organization
including investigation officers, accounts and procurement staff. The full management
team also attended a two week residential course in M&E. Importantly, the ongoing
involvement in FEAT itself provided a significant institutional development experience
for the Secretariat though the orientation to capacity building should have been got right
much earlier. Evaluative skills in particular were strengthened over time as well as public
relations and coaching skills.

Component 4 - Project coordination

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Under this component, ATIP aimed at providing support to the Good
Governance Coordination Unit (GGCU) to improve its M&E capacity including
reporting on and disseminating the overall results of the NACSAP. The interventions
and activities under this component were aimed at supporting (i) overall
coordination of good governance programs, especially the NACSAP; and (ii) high
level M&E, including reporting to the President on progress of implementation of the
anti-corruption measures. As indicated in the body of the report (paras. 65 & 66) there
was probably a conceptual misapprehension about the intended arrangements that
subsequently militated against optimal coordination and integration with governmental
M&E. The corrective measures taken with restructuring improved matters but it are
clear inadequacies of coordination did impose some drag on project performance.

                                             44
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The section below is taken from the ATIP PAD, and provides assessment of the
economic benefits that are expected as a result of the planned investments.

Benefits from implementing the LSRP and strengthening oversight and watchdog
institutions
The project is expected to have positive economic benefits to the economy as a result of
implementing the LSRP and by strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions.
Implementation of the legal and judicial reform program will result in improvements in
the commercial legal environment, improvements in the delivery of justice particularly in
the rural areas and generally observance of the rule of law. Improvement in the rule of
law will support the achievement of the NACSAP objective of reducing corruption and
improving governance in Tanzania. The implementation of the OWI component will
result in improvements in domestic accountability that will impact on efficiency in the
implementation of core reform programs and achievement of their intended objectives.

Benefits from implementing the PFMRP

The expected quantifiable benefits from implementing the PFMRP will arise primarily
from savings in budget deficit financing, savings in interest payments on domestic debt
and savings arising from reduction in procurement losses. These savings are expected to
accrue annually for a period of five years, commencing in year three of implementation.
In column two, various parameters have been identified as a basis for quantifying the
benefit streams. The next column lists the values of the budget deficit, annual domestic
debt, and funds lost through procurement in the base year – August 2005.

Implementation of public financial management reforms will result in positive economic
and fiscal impacts. There will be significant budgetary benefits after implementation of
the project compared to the current levels of GoT annual expenditure. The PFMRP has
an economic rate of return of 26.3% at August 2005 prices. This is significantly higher
than the opportunity cost of capital of 12%. These fiscal benefits will have an impact on
the overall economy.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A. The performance of Judiciary of Tanzania: evidence from survey data38

In 2010, a nationwide survey was carried out to track the performance of Judiciary of
Tanzania across all courts39. The survey was managed with the Ministry of Constitutional
and Legal Affairs and received support from the National Bureau of Statistics.
The survey, with reference year 2010, was carried out by four mobile teams for a period
of about two weeks from end of August to middle of September, 2011. Follow-up on
non-responding establishments (courts) continued up to November 2011. Questionnaires
lifted data from administrative records in all court registries. The overall objective of the
report is to provide an analysis of case flow data for the year 2010 as well as trend
information. The specific objectives of the report include:
     • provision of trends on case backlogs
     • establishing MKUKUTA Cluster III pertinent indicator level and trend
     • contributing to the establishment of knowledge about status of case backlog
     • facilitating monitoring and evaluation mechanism on case backlogs

  The primary function of the Judiciary of Tanzania is to dispense timely justice for all according to the
law of Tanzania. The administration of justice can be achieved by having and deciding cases filed in courts.
This is carried out in the Court of Appeal of Tanzania, The High Court Zones and High Court Divisions,
Resident Magistrate Courts, District Courts and Primary Courts.

A2: Survey’s Key findings

Cases pending as at the end of the year: pending cases are mainly in the lower courts,
with district and primary courts accounting for about three quarters of the cases (see
Figure 5.1). Moreover, across the courts the number of cases pending is not as yet
showing any apparent trend. In particular, performance seems to deteriorate in the
Primary Courts. However, the level of non-response at the levels of primary courts (32.8
percent) needs to be taken into account when interpreting the findings.

The number of cases pending over the period shows a trend that might lead to an increase
as presented in Table 5.1. The figure on pending for the year 2009, as that for the year
2008, has been lifted from the 2008 – 2009 Consolidated report as that from the current
data set displays an underestimate due to the low response. However, this is as well
confounded by the fact the previous report did not dwell on non-response.

Overall, for all courts, the number of cases pending is not as yet showing any apparent
trend as shown in Table 5.2 below:

However at individual court level there are varying trends with the Court of Appeal, the 3
High Court Divisions, the District Courts and Primary Courts showing an apparent
increasing trend in number of cases pending and the rest – 13 High Court Zones and
Resident Magistrate Courts – a decreasing trend implying improvement in performance.

As shown in Table 5.3, in 2010, filed cases were mostly at the primary courts which
alone accounted for over two thirds of the cases. The projected population for Tanzania
Mainland was 39.475 million, 40.683 million and 41.914 million during 2008, 2009 and
2010 respectively. For 2010 the litigation rate, which is the number of filed cases
(excluding appeals) per 100,000 inhabitants, for all courts is 411.7.

Regarding case load - the number of cases pending during the previous year plus cases
filed in the subsequent year - primary Courts account for over half of the case load:

  A separation of appeals from all cases filed was done on the 2011 survey for the analysis in this report.
This was not the case in the previous publication and thus not available (NA) in same cells

                                                    50
Table 5.4 and Figure 5.2 show that for all courts there is a decline in the case load. This
decline is governed mainly by the situation in the 13 HCZs and PCs. The 3 High Court
Divisions are showing a very apparent exception. In other words, data show that case
load has been consistently shifting from the PCs to DCs, RMCs and the 3 HCDs.

courts as shown in Table 5.5 and figure 5.3

There is overall a decline in the number of cases disposed of as shown in Table 5.6.
More precisely, there is an apparent increase in cases disposed of in the 3HCDs, RMCs
and DCs. The 13 HCZs and PCs show the reverse situation. Moreover, the share across
court levels with respect to cases disposed of is changing, with an increase in the share of
cases disposed of for RMCs and DCs, while it is the reverse trend for PCs (table 5.7).

The ratio of the total number of cases disposed of in a given year to the total number of
filed cases during the same year show the Disposition or Clearance Ratio. Table 5.8
shows there is likelihood of improvement of the number of cases disposed of. The
exception to this was in the case of the 13 High Court Zones and PCs.

The ratio of the Case Load to Decided Cases show the Congestion Ratio as shown in
Table 5.9. Overall there is every indication that congestion will likely be on the
decrease. This seeming trend is governed by the trend shown by the 3 HCDs and
Resident Magistrate Courts, while it has been the reverse for the 13 HCZs.

 Table 5.10 and Figure 5.4 present the extent of expediting the administration of justice
over the years. This is depicted by the indicator – Backlog – which is the number of
cases which have been outstanding (pending) for more than two years. The percentage
presents the monitoring criterion under MKUKUTA (as indicator 1 in Goal 4 of cluster
III).

The best performance in terms of both level and trend is displayed by the Court of Appeal,
i.e. relatively lower percent and declining trend. With the exception of the 13 HCZs,
the rest of the court levels are showing a persistent downward trend, showing
improving performance. This is also the case of the PCs.

B. Key Recommendations, 2010 Annual Statistics Report of the Judiciary

Processes leading to analysis and preparation of this report as well as the survey results
clearly demonstrate the need and urgency of strengthening the statistics sub-function in
the Judiciary. Follow-up actions should focus on achieving two broad objectives,
namely: to consolidate the achievements already made in putting in place a statistics
management system and to institutionalize the statistics sub-function in the Judiciary. In
this respect, a nine – strand approach is recommended involving:

       correctness during manual editing at
       headquarters.

C. Students enrolment rates and examination performance, the Law School of
Tanzania.

The rules governing the conduct of examinations were reviewed and amended in June
2011 to allow candidates to resit failed examinations if they passed at least three of the
seven core courses. Following this change, the number of failed candidates dropped from
around 50% of candidates in a particular cohort to about 10% (see the results of the 7th or
8th Cohort). This means that while 30% would now pass at first sitting, 60% would have
to resit their failed examination papers.

The examination results of the 7th and 8th Cohort students were conducted and processed
according to the new rules. The results of the previous cohort students were conducted
and processed according to the rules that were phased out in June 2011.

The Law School of Tanzania results appear consistent with the trends in the East African
region (see results from the Kenya School of Law and the Law Development Centre in
Uganda).

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The preliminary analysis of the Bank team has been shared at the end of the ICR mission
with the GoT, with the purpose to keep authorities apprised of some early hypotheses in
the closing assessment of the project. This occasion generated a lively debate with
government counterparts, and confirmed the full engagement and collaboration received
from GoT to achieve the mission objectives.

Drawing on this initial discussion, the GoT prepared and delivered its own ICR on April
2, whose inputs have been used to inform the finalization of the ICR report. A summary
of the GoT’s ICR is provided below (the full report is available upon request, and its
reference details included as additional entry to the list of supporting documents).

Overview

 Accountability, Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP) was conceived by the
 Government and World Bank for the purpose of accelerating the implementation of
 National Framework for Good Governance which was designed to focus on the
 following: Ensuring participation of people in decision making for social,
 political and economic development; Legal and regulatory framework for
 private sector development; Constitutionalism, the rule of law, administration of
 justice and protection of human rights; Gender             equity; Accountability,
 transparency, and integrity in management of public affairs; Electoral democracy;
 and Greater public service capabilities to deliver services efficiently and
 effectively. The International Development Association (IDA) credit of US $ 43.8 for
 the ATIP, Cr 4171-TA, was approved in 2006. The Original Project Development
 Objectives (PDO) for ATIP was to Contribute to improved access to judicial and
 legal services, accountability and transparent in the use of public financial
 resources through the improvement of skills and system to deliver judicial and legal
 services, public financial management, and strengthening the capacity of oversight
 and watchdog institutions (OWIs) to perform their role. The Government of United
 Republic of Tanzania is expressing its sincere appreciation to World Bank
 Management for the support extended to various sectors under the Accountability,
 Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP).

 Implementation of ATIP was organized in four components, which are;
 Component 1 – Strengthening legal and judicial systems, Component 2 –
 Enhancing Public Financial Accountability, Component 3 – Strengthening
 Oversight and Watchdog Institutions, and Component 4 – Project Coordination.
 Strengthening of legal and judicial systems was implemented through component
 one with the purpose of supporting the implementation of GoT’s comprehensive
 legal and judicial system. The Legal Sector Reform Program which is within the
 Ministry of Constitutional and Legal Affairs had the responsibility of Strengthening of
 legal and judicial systems. Enhancing public financial accountability was
 implemented through component two under the Public Financial management

                                           59
Reform Program (PFMRP) in collaboration with other DPs by pooling funds in a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) arrangement. The PFMRP is implemented by the
Ministry of Finance. The aim was to improve management of public financial
resources for economic growth, public services delivery and poverty reduction.
Component three was designed to strengthen the demand for accountability by
oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIs) and improvements in ethics and
integrity among professional associations. The implementing Agency for this
component was the Ethics Secretariat, through the Facility for                  Ethics,
Accountability and Transparency (FEAT). The component aimed at improving
domestic accountability particularly with respect to crosscutting reforms; i.e. LSRP,
PFMRP, PSRP and NACSAP. It also aimed at ensuring that OWIs are informed of
public sector performance and hence more effectively able to hold the government
accountable. Component four had the responsibility of ensuring overall coordination
of the activities related in improving accountability, transparency and integrity and,
more particularly monitoring progress of the fight against corruption and improvement
in good governance, the support was provided to GGCU to help the unit achieve the
objectives of its action plan. Progress in achieving results was measured by the
following key indicators. Progress on legal and judicial reform will be measured by
the percentage of court cases outstanding for two years or more (PAF indicators).
Progress on public financial management will be measured by the percentage of
MDAs with clean value for money audit in the NAO report presented to parliament.
       Progress in strengthening OWIs will be measured by: The increased number
of OWIs that use evidence-based reports in assessing government performance in
core reform programs, and the increased number of professional associations
actively promoting ethical conduct amongst members.

The main beneficiaries of ATIP are: the Government of the United Republic of
Tanzania (URT), Private sector, and the Citizens of Tanzania. The Government
benefited through reduced time taken to adjudicate cases, improved legal and
regulatory framework which has benefited the private sector to operate in a fair and
competitive environment. The increased number of primary courts and provision of
free legal aid services to the poor have enhanced human rights and good governance.
Also the Government has benefited in the areas of forecasting and collecting
revenue which has improved service deliver. Transparency in procurement processes
has enabled fair participation of the private sector to render services to the public.
Capacities building in the oversight and watchdog institutions have contributed to
make the Government more accountable to the Citizens.

The major achievements under the ATIP are as follows:

   • The civilianization of the prosecution services rolled to eight pilot regions,
     namely Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Ruvuma, Tanga,
     Kilimanjaro and Mbeya. The Service was also rolled 8 districts in all the
     eight regions. These are Manyara, Lushoto, Monduli, Singida, Mbinga,
     Bariadi, Arusha Urban and Kibaha. Total of six (6) Regional prosecution
     Office buildings were renovated.

                                          60
   • Capacity building initiatives were undertaken in the areas of infrastructure
     development through construction of primary courts, establishment of a law
     school, while training was undertaken for judges, magistrates, state attorneys,
     social welfare staff and other judiciary support staff. Institutional support for
     records and case flow management, transport facilities for courts
     administration were also provided.

   • The public Audit Act No. 11 of 2008 was enacted to enhance operational
     independence of the National Audit Office, the public Finance Act No. 6 of
     2001 was amended to establish the post of Internal Auditor General and
     enable the Accountant General to oversee Local Government Finances. The
     consolidated financial statements were timely submitted to the Controller and
     Auditor General. The Government Financial Statistics (GFS) codes 2001 and
     Classification of Functions of Government (CoFoG) was adopted. The capacity
     building were undertaken in the area of Macroeconomic Modeling, Cash
     Management, Public Finance Management, accounting and information
     technology.

   •   Electronic funds transfer was started in 2010 by using Tanzania Interbank
       Settlement System (TISS). Strengthening the oversight functions through
       capacity building to Parliamentary Accounts Committees (PAC)

   • Introduction of grant through the Facility for Ethics, Accountability and
     Transparency (FEAT) speeded up the process of building the capacity of
     oversight and watchdog institutions. Since the inception of FEAT a total of
     49 applications were funded to improve awareness in good governance,
     promoting professional ethics, good conduct to public servants, t enhancing
     efficiency and accountability.

   • The M & E system and Information Education and Communication were
     developed for NACSAP implementation

Challenges encountered during implementation of ATIP

   •   Timely preparation and approval of the annual work plan and budget
       due to micromanagement .There was a lot of direct interference with
       components on the priority of activities including lack of trust.

   •   Experienced personnel for project coordination and management to
       comply with processes and procedures. As      a result some of the
       components project were not implemented as scheduled;

   •   Delay in release of fund to components due to a clause in the MoU requiring
       approval by JSC and different timing of approving work plans and releases.
       Late reimbursement of unspent funds to holding accounts from spending
       entities

                                         61
   •   There were delays in disbursement funds for project implementation
       sometimes due to late submission of work plan and performance report. For
       example FEAT implementation started in December, 2007 but funds for
       projects execution made available February, 2009. Some of the spending
       units were not reimbursing unspent balances on time after the financial year
       has ended.
Despite of the shortcomings experienced during the implementation of ATIP, the
intended objective was fairly attained. Implementation of this project (ATIP) created
and accrued lessons that will be used for future development of projects of this
nature. The lesson learnt is that effective and constructive dialogue is essential for
project success.

The way forward

After completion of the ATIP the following is the way forward to sustain the realised
achievements. The Legal sector reform programme is currently conducting legal
sector assessment review whose result will inform on the preparations of the next
phase of legal sector reform programme and other related reform programmes/projects
in the sector.

PFMRP next phase IV has been developed and about to be launched. PFMRP IV is a
successor phase which will continue to address issues which started in the earlier
phases such as Improving Budgeting and Planning; rationalization of Government
financial systems; rolling out IFMS to the new LGAs, RSs and PMO - RALG
institutions. The next phase will also focus on: revenue management through
strengthening non tax revenue collection; reviewing and enacting tax
administration law; improving        environment for domestic revenue collection;
improving public procurement performance; Strengthening debt and cash
management ; improving accountability and management of Government assets; and
facilitating migration from IPSAS cash to IPSAS accrual. Following establishment
of Internal Auditor General, the next phase will focus on increased coverage in
quality of internal audits; strengthening external audit functions; improving
scrutiny of audit reports; and enhancing transparency and accountability. In addition,
the program will improve communication and public access to key fiscal
information to stakeholders and institute change management and leadership.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Component 1

The ICR mission had good opportunity for ample discussions with the Chair of the DP
Legal Working Group as she made herself available to join several of the scheduled
meetings. A further exchange was held with a centrally involved prior member of the
group.
In the early years of the LSRP and into the life of ATIP’s support, implementation was
characterised by “non-stop discussion on process rather than strategy? it was reported.
This impacted higher level management relationships and, as a consequence, the full
possibilities for capacity building were not realised. One particular aspect of the
relationships was that the judicial actors had an inherent tendency to resist any
examination of their working procedures and systems in the context of the reform
programme. Despite this atmosphere for implementation early on, however, it is
maintained that a viable pattern of institutional ownership did begin to emerge with time.
An opportunity for greater cohesion in implementation may have been missed though in
the failure to act on the mooted proposal to designate the legal sector coordinator post at
MoCAJ as Director of Reforms.
A good measure of success for the LSRP and ATIP’s contribution was attested to by the
DPs. The reported improvements in case backlogs were notable. The records
management pilot in the High Court had proceeded well and was being further built
upon. The installation of a separate cadre of court administrators presaged significant
improvements. And the eventual setting up of a Legal Aid Secretariat – after several
years of institutional politicking - represented a breakthrough with regard to court
access. Meanwhile professionalization of primary court magistrates was being advanced
by the new stipulation for qualification through the Law School (the new construction for
which was itself a considerable success) and recent reported improvements to salary
scales. In addition the CCHRAG had been supported in some important initiatives e.g.
on land rights and albino rights.
Although outside the specific financing parameters of ATIP, notable achievement for the
LSRP was also evidenced in the nationwide pilots for the civilianisation of the
prosecution service, the decongestion of prisons and civil rights training for the police.
Against this background, the ending of ATIP support for the legal sector was seen as
regrettable. Much work remained to be done not least on case management, information
systems and other capacity building, with further scope for extra infrastructure at all
levels. Despite DP expressions of positive support, likely funds for 2012 and future years
were now meagre. The EU, although accepting the desirability for sector investment,
was constrained by its internal regulations on basket fund participation and DfID had
decided to specifically focus on anti-corruption. This left immediate future pledges at $4
mn. by CIDA, $1.4 mn. by DANIDA (itself an increase) and less than $100,000 by
UNICEF in the area of child protection.
Another point highlighted in respect of the duration of ATIP, was that a no cost extension
had been anticipated and was seen to be eminently justifiable. The rather late
confirmation by the Bank that this would not be possible (end of November 2011) left no
realistic time to address uncompleted elements of the project work plans.

                                            63
Component 2

A dedicated meeting was held with the PFM Working Group which included basket fund
contributors as well the EU and SIDA which channel financing through General Budget
Support (the latter has additional support to the National Audit Office).
Emphasis was placed on adherence in planning terms to the platform approach adopted
through successive PFMRPs. An inbuilt difficulty existed in this, however, in that in
execution the programme tended to be much more process focussed rather than centred
on the delivery of concrete platform elements.
Prior to 2009, PFMRP assessments were split between Government and DPs with the
former adjudging programme progress at marginally satisfactory and the latter at
marginally unsatisfactory. In recent years, assessment has been consolidated under the
joint GBS reviews and there has been a sharper concentration on a group of - twenty -
agreed actions. In FY09 the assessment was rated at marginally satisfactory and in FY10
at satisfactory. The upward shift reflects perceived improvements in a number of
programme elements including IFMIS, rationalisation of government accounts and the
operationalization of the Audit Act of 2008. On programme management, the decision to
establish a Deputy Permanent Secretary for Reform at MoF was considered positively as
was the installation of the Reform Coordination Unit although with this there was seen to
be more of a focus on structural than programme content issues. A specific question was
raised on the prominence of training, study tours, consultancies and studies in the
programme’s work plans in terms of demonstrable returns on investment.
The Working Group members expressed a lack of certainty on the Bank’s orientation
towards the PFMRP. Reference was made to incongruent opinions between the Bank and
other DPs in the group in past years and to the seeming discrepancy between PEFA and
CPIA ratings on PFM. Further, group members queried the rationale for the Bank’s
position on financing support to (or around) PFMRP 4, currently under negotiation.

Annex 9. Original RF (pre-restructuring)


The Results Framework presented in the table below refers to pre-restructuring phase
(2006-2010). The table clearly shows the lack of progress on component 1 and 3, with
several indicators showing little or no change from the original baseline. It also shows
the limited numbers of intermediate indicators chosen to track progress across
components. The 2010 restructuring paper addressed this problem and substantially
improved the quality of the RF for the project.

Annex 11: List of People met during the ICR Mission

The ICR mission (March 26 – April 5, 2012) had a kick off meeting with the Deputy
Permanent Secretary at the State House on March 26. The event provided the opportunity
to introduce the objectives of the ICR mission and make initial contacts with key actors
within the government and the donor community.

During the first week the team carried out a first round of consultations and interviews
with key stakeholders across the project components, including the Legal and Judicial
Sector (Component 1), Public Finance Management Sector (Component 2) and Oversight
and Watchdog Institutions (Component 3). During the second week the team took stock
of the initial findings and engaged on a second round of consultations to further probe our
hypotheses and collect additional evidence on the progress and achievements of the ATIP.
Given the project's financing instrument (basket fund) attention was also given to explore
the dynamics of donor coordination and two meetings were organized with the donor
working groups on the legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP) and the Public Financial
Management Reform Program (PFMRP), respectively.

The mission concluded with a wrap-up meeting at the State House with the Permanent
Secretary, senior government officers from the 3 components and the ATIP Project
Coordinator. The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the team's preliminary
findings, generating a lively discussion with the GoT counterparts.
Overall, more than 60 people were met during the ICR mission. The list of people and
their respective affiliation is provided below.
