F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Malawi Emergency Recovery Project is aimed at supporting the restoration of assets
and production following the drought-induced emergency in early 2005, and thereby

supporting the growth path central to the macroeconomic program adopted by the new
administration since May 2004.          Specifically, this emergency grant will provide an
additional USD30 million to allow critical private sector imports for the restoration of
assets, investment and production to take place with the least disruption to the economy.
The domestic financial resources generated by the grant will go towards financing the
approved Government's budget, including expanded safety nets and other costs of
responding to the drought, and will allow Government to reduce domestic debt levels and
maintain spending levels in line with the targets of the IMF PRGF program which has
recently been approved.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

        In January-February 2005 Malawi suffered a major drought, as a result of which
the maize harvest for 2005 was estimated to be almost 30 percent lower than the previous
year, itself a shortage year, potentially resulting in the worst maize season in ten years.
The expected drop in maize production corresponded to a shortfall of about 20 percent in
national food consumption requirements between April 2005 and March 2006, when the
next harvest was expected. These forecasts were confirmed later in 2005.

        In addition, indications were that the incomes of at least 4.2 million people, more
than one-third of the population, had been severely reduced as a result of the harvest
failure. Humanitarian support of around 370,000 MT in maize equivalent terms (costing
around US$110 million) was needed to maintain nutrition levels.1 Most of this support
was required during the period November 2005 to March 2006.

        In addition to the immediate humanitarian needs, the crisis was expected to have a
severe negative impact on domestic investment and production because the exceptional
food import requirements would have constrained imports critical to production, notably
petroleum, fertilizer, machinery, and construction materials.      Further, the disruption
caused by the drought to trade and economic activity risked undermining business
confidence and investment. At the time of the Grant, GDP growth in 2005 was projected
at 2.1 percent (compared with a pre-drought projection of 4.8 percent). This situation
called for a an exceptional response from the Government and development partners,
including the Bank, to help restore physical assets and investment, and avoid a collapse in
productive activities during the ensuing twelve months.

        The Government had agreed a new Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with the IMF
in August 2004 (which subsequently was replaced by a PRGF program in August 2005).
This followed three years in which Malawi had been off track with the IMF programs,
starting soon after reaching the HIPC Decision Point in December 2000. In particular,
fiscal performance had been poor ­ with high and rising levels of domestic debt ­ until
May 2004, when a new government was elected.                Fiscal management improved
significantly during the 2004/5 fiscal year. Approval of the new PRGF program in
August 2005 provided a measure of confidence that economic management and
performance were improving.




1Initial estimates were somewhat lower at MT272,000 and a cost of around US$55
million.

        Given the threat to economic recovery posed by the drought, with some assurance
of improving economic management, the Bank decided that a rapid injection of resources
was needed to prevent a damaging shortfall in the availability of productive assets in the
latter part of 2005, as well as a potential collapse of recently-bolstered, but fragile
confidence in the Government's economic management.               It therefore designed an
emergency operation, with special emphasis on delivering foreign exchange resources
within the narrow window of the last few months of 2005. In addition to this operation,
the Bank reallocated funds under the MASAF 3 project to emergency public works,
continued supporting programs aimed at improving disaster preparedness and mitigation,
provided technical assistance for trading in maize options,2 and maintained its dialogue
with the Government on food security and agricultural marketing options.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

        The need for exceptional imports of maize was expected to place a severe strain
on the smooth operation of trade during the last few months of 2005 and early 2006.
Malawi's trade pattern is seasonal, with tobacco exports, which account for almost 60
percent of the total, concentrated in the April to September period. On the other hand,
imports peak during September to January when imports of agricultural inputs and food
take place. In 2005, the emergency was expected to increase the trade deficit in the latter
half of 2005 by 20 percent over the previous year. At the same time, Malawi's foreign
exchange reserves covered only 1.5 months of imports at the end of August of that year.
Further, the need for additional food imports was expected to impact not only on foreign
exchange requirements, but also on physical import capacity, with available transport and
logistical capacity also put under strain.

        The emergency was also expected to put pressure on fiscal stabilization efforts.
The Government's budget approved in July 2005 had already been changed to
accommodate the additional costs of the relief operations and ongoing food security
measures by about 2 percent of GDP (US$47 million). The Government had adopted
some initial measures to contain the fiscal impact of the crisis to 1.3 percent of GDP and
minimize the impact on its debt stabilization objectives, but required additional financing
to keep its overall deficit within target. Several donors had pledged additional support to
finance a portion of the Government's planned humanitarian interventions, although the
level of funding and planned level of intervention was not sufficient to cover the then
estimate of humanitarian needs.

        The Government decided to focus relief efforts on the most severely affected 2
million people, (out of 4.2 million affected), for a total food requirement of 200,000 MT.
Through the Food Security Joint Task Force (FSJTF), the Government and the



2Although not part of the operation, in parallel the Bank assisted the Government to put
forward a call option for 60,000 tons of maize in July 2005. This helped reduce near-
term pressure on foreign exchange and import routes and locked in maize prices for
Malawi.



                                                                                         2

development partners agreed on three levels of intervention: (i) provide targeted free food
distribution; (ii) scale up existing safety nets through expanded public works programs; and
(iii) import and sell maize domestically on commercial terms to ensure adequate supplies in
the domestic market. The 200,000 MT of maize was to be imported by the public sector
and distributed through targeted food distribution and sales on commercial terms.

        Other development partners, notably DfID, the EU, Norway, Japan, France,
Ireland and the USA had pledged financial and commodity support in excess of US$40
million to the Government to respond to the humanitarian crisis.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

        The Malawi Emergency Recovery Project was aimed at supporting the restoration
of assets and production following the drought-induced emergency in early 2005, and
thereby supporting the growth path central to the macroeconomic program adopted by the
new administration since May 2004. Specifically, this emergency grant was to provide
an additional USD30 million to allow critical private sector imports for the restoration of
assets, investment and production to take place with the least disruption to the economy.
The domestic financial resources generated by the grant were to go towards financing the
approved Government's budget, including expanded safety nets and other costs of
responding to the drought, and were to allow Government to reduce domestic debt levels
and maintain spending levels in line with the targets of the IMF PRGF program which
had recently been approved.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

        There was no revision in PDOs or indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
        The operation was not targeted at any particular beneficiary group, but was rather
aimed at mitigating an anticipated economic contraction with damaging long-term
consequences for the whole population.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

        The operation consisted of one component to provide financing for private sector
imports against a positive list.

1.6 Revised Components

        There was no revision in the component.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
        Preparation of the operation started in April 2005, following meetings of the
FSJTF at which the extent of the emergency started to become apparent. A formal
request for assistance was received from the Government in June 2005 and the operation
was approved by the Board in early September 2005.                  The Government and the
development partners had been coordinating the response to the food crisis through the
Food Security Joint Task Force (FSJTF), chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture and
including some 50 representatives of Government Ministries, donor agencies, NGOs, and
private sector, including the World Bank. The information available from the first crop
surveys in February 2005 was of necessity uncertain, and there were concerns at the time
that the extent of the emergency could have been exaggerated, especially since the
response to the previous drought emergency of 2001/2 had been inadequate and delayed.
The Bank decided to start preparing an emergency operation, since it would have been
easier to call such an operation off had it not been needed than to start belated preparation.

        On the macroeconomic side, preparation was coordinated with the IMF PRGF
program preparation, on the basis of which a balance of payments gap for 2005/06 of
slightly over $20 million was identified.

        The main issue during preparation was the choice of lending instrument. The
initial plan was to design a supplemental to the ongoing Fiscal Management and
Accelerating Growth (FIMAG) adjustment operation, the second tranche of which was
expected for release in late 2005.      This instrument was originally preferred because it
would permit fast disbursement and minimize preparation time.              However, following
various consultations within the Bank, a decision was made to switch to an emergency
recovery operation under OP 8.50, because delays in the FIMAG second tranche release
were considered likely, due to continuing discussion of the reform of ADMARC. (In the
event, the second tranche of FIMAG was not released until April 2006.) The decision to
switch to an emergency operation was also taken because the Bank had recently
introduced a new OP 8.60 on development policy lending, replacing adjustment lending,
and did not want the credibility of the new instrument jeopardized by presenting a risky
supplemental as the first one under the new OP.

        O.P. 8.50 on emergency lending provided for a fast-disbursing component to meet
import needs, but required that disbursements for that component be made against a
positive list. In order to maintain the maximum flexibility in the use of the financing, the
Bank decided not to cap any import categories. To mitigate concerns a positive list


                                                                                           4

would delay disbursements, the Bank took steps to ensure that eligible imports and
documentation requirements were identified well before negotiations.                Abbreviated
processing as provided for under O.P. 8.50 was applied to the Grant. Specifically, and in
the light of serious delays in disbursements under the previous Emergency Drought
Recovery Project (MAI-P080368 approved in November 2002), the Bank adjusted import
documentation requirements to include bills of entry certified by the Malawi Revenue
Authority (MRA), rather than bills of lading (which were not readily available to
government since they are held by private sector). In addition, the Bank deployed its
procurement and financial management staff from the country office to sit on an inter-
ministerial Implementation Committee, which included representatives from the Ministry
of Finance (MoF), the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) and the MRA, to help with the
verification of documentation so that reimbursement authorization could be expedited.

        The local currency funds generated from the foreign exchange sales were to be
deposited in the MG1 (Malawi Government Number One) account at the RBM and used
solely for financing the approved Government budget. The grant was not to be used to
increase spending beyond the levels approved by Parliament, and was therefore expected
to also contribute to domestic debt reduction.

        Finally, the Bank agreed to retroactive financing of 30 percent of the Grant, the
maximum permitted. This enabled the RBM to start assembling documentation for
imports that had taken place as far back as April 2005, to expedite disbursements.

2.2 Implementation

(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
        The Grant was disbursed in three installments, of $9, $12.5 and $8.5 million
between early November and late December 2005. Seventy-two percent of the grant was
disbursed against fuel imports, and evidently helped replenish credit lines for fuel imports.
The local currency counterpart of the grant, MK3.7 billion, was credited to the MG1
account. In line with the Grant Agreement an audit of the project accounts by the
National Audit Office is being carried out.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

        In accordance with the objective of preventing a decline in economic activity
during the drought emergency, two monitoring indicators were agreed: the level of
investment (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) in 2005 and 2006; and the level of imports
during the fiscal year 2005/06. The target for GFCF was MK19 billion, or 9.3 percent of
GDP in 2004, while the import target was US$976 million, the level projected under the
Government's financial program. In the event, GFCF in 2005 was MK21.9 billion, and
imports were US$1.1 billion. Intermediate outcome indicators relating to disbursement
and use of the counterpart were defined, (see Annex 2), and were equaled or exceeded in
both cases.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



                                                                                                5

(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
        The positive import list excluded any items for which safeguards would have been
applicable.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
        A review of the emergency response to the drought was carried out in 2006 and
was reflected in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) of that year.
Interventions to reduce the frequency and incidence of food crises are included in the
MGDS, such as increased emphasis on irrigation and the development of market-based
products for managing weather, price and supply shocks. Malawi's financial program
also provides for some accumulation of foreign exchange reserves to provide a better
cushion in the event of future emergencies. The MGDS also emphasizes the provision of
safety nets.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
        Rating: Highly Satisfactory. The operation was conceived in response to a major
emergency in a least developed, poor country. In particular, Malawi is vulnerable to
large external shocks which were, given previous experience, likely to derail achievement
of broad national development objectives. The risks associated with not proceeding with
such an operation in the context of a recent and fragile resumption of responsible
economic management were very high.             Had the Bank not undertaken this operation,
there was a serious risk of import and foreign exchange shortages which would have
jeopardized agricultural production in the 2006 season, contributed to a further escalation
of domestic public debt, and possibly ignited another round of inflation.

        It could be argued that the Bank should have delayed preparation of the operation
until the extent of the food crisis became clearer, especially since the first official crop
forecast in Malawi, usually at around February, might not be reliable and the prospect of
crop failure could have been exaggerated. In fact, the forecast of early 2005 turned out to
be an underestimate and, in agreement with development partners, the provision of
humanitarian aid was increased from an initial estimate of MT272,000 to a level of
MT371,000, and final information on the 2005 harvest was available by the time the
operation went to the board in September.          But even if it had not been, the risk of an
inadequate and delayed response, too late to meet the peak import requirements of late
2005, was rightly weighed more heavily than the risk that the intervention would not be
needed.

        Speed of disbursement was critical to the achievement of these valid objectives.
Everything possible was done to ensure fast disbursement given the requirement of a


                                                                                            6

positive list for an emergency operation under OP 8.50.        Conditionality which might
have held up disbursement was avoided.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory. Both final (investment and imports) and intermediate
outcomes (disbursements) exceeded objectives (see Annex 2).              Without a robust
economic model, it is not possible to be certain that these outcomes were better than what
would have occurred without the grant and other similar donor support. It is undoubtedly
the case that most of the improvement was attributable to factors other than this operation,
most notably other donor support. However, given that actual imports in 2005/06 were
USD1,003 million and exceeded the forecasts (of USD976) by around USD30 million,
and that forex reserves ended up USD25 million below the level anticipated for 2005/06,3
the MERG likely contributed to the improvements in performance and to prevent a further
reduction in reserves. Overall, the performance of the Malawian economy improved
significantly in 2006. Growth is estimated to have reached over eight percent for 2006
and inflation has been reduced close to single digits. Investment has increased from about
10 percent of GDP in 2002 and 2003 to around 15 percent in 2006. In addition, crowding
out of credit to the private sector through high domestic borrowing by the authorities has
been reversed and consequently credit to the private sector has seen healthy increases
(from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2006). The reduced claims on
domestic resources have also led to a decrease in interest rates: rates for 91 days T bills
have fallen to 17 percent as of January 2007 down from 24 percent at the end of 2005.

        Since the end use of the emergency grant proceeds was not controlled, other than
to ensure that all disbursements from the grant were on the basis of imports carried out by
the private sector, the impact of the grant on levels of production and investment cannot
be separated or quantified. However, it is clear that the grant contributed to this recovery,
especially because its timing prevented a potentially severe foreign exchange shortage in
late 2005. Most of the grant was disbursed against receipts of fuel imports (around 75
percent) and agricultural inputs (9 percent). Therefore, it may seem reasonable to infer
that, in the absence of the grant, transport operations and seasonal input requirements for
agriculture, would have been adversely affected. In fact, since the Grant disbursements
were made on against receipts of imports that had already taken place, the main impact of
the Grant resources was on releasing additional foreign exchange resources in the
economy.4 In addition, the counterpart of the grant helped prevent a further rise in
domestic government borrowing and helped maintain public social expenditure.



3 IMF Program projections for the level of forex reserves at end-June 2006 was
USD166.5 million (EBS 05/113) and the latest estimates of the actual level of reserves is
USD141.0 (EBS 06/109).

4 The fact that Grant disbursements were made for the most part against receipts of
petroleum import largely reflects the fact that petroleum import contracts tend to be the

                                                                                           7

         The timing of the grant, with all of it disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2005,
ensured that an acute foreign exchange shortage was avoided at a critical time. As noted,
official foreign exchange reserves at the end of August 2005 were US$120 million, equal
to 1.5 months of imports, and some essential imports, most notably fuel and fertilizer,
were jeopardized.     Had the grant not been provided, there would have been downward
pressure on the exchange rate with inflationary effects in the short term. (In the longer
term, Malawi's currency does appear over-valued and subsequently there has been
evidence of a parallel foreign exchange market, but a sharp currency depreciation at the
same time as food emergency would probably have had adverse consequences for
poverty).

         On the fiscal side, domestic debt decreased from 25 percent of GDP in 2004/5 to
20 percent in 2005/6, and the grant can be said to have contributed to this. Had the grant
not been provided, and if the Government had tried to reduce domestic debt, it is likely
that discretionary expenditure, mainly in the social sectors, would have been reduced,
with adverse consequences for poverty and possibly for social stability.

3.3 Efficiency

(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
         Not applicable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory. In addition to the points stated above, the operation helped
the Government remain within the parameters of the PRGF program, which in turn led to
HIPC completion and MDRI relief in 2006. The review of the emergency response,
carried out jointly by government and donors in 2006, gives a very positive assessment of
the overall manner in which the response was managed by Government, and supported by
donors.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
         While poverty and gender impact were not specifically targeted in an operational
sense, the operation was motivated by the fact that the drought emergency would




largest in terms of financing (with contracts averaging USD 2-3 million); by submitting
documentation related to such contracts the government could therefore claim
disbursement of large amounts of the Grant with minimum paperwork. Similar reasoning
applies to imports of agricultural inputs (mostly fertilizer).

certainly impact predominantly on the poor, and that alleviating the broad impact on the
economy would at least prevent poverty, including the impact on poor women, becoming
worse. As noted above, the impact on public expenditure was probably to help maintain
social expenditure.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible. Since the development outcome is already observed ­ i.e.
the satisfactory macroeconomic performance in 2005/06 ­ there is no risk. The MoP
outlined two risks: that the extent of the emergency requirement was underestimated and
that more donor support would be needed; and that there could be a second crop failure in
2006. In both cases, the Bank committed itself to helping Malawi raise more resources
from donors should they be required. By proceeding with the operation at the time it did,
the Bank probably strengthened its leverage to help raise more resources if the need arose.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Highly satisfactory. This rating is justified by:
         (a) the speed of response to an emergency situation: from the time that the
         emergency became apparent (in mid-April 2005) to Board presentation (mid-
         September) was less than five months. This was especially good because the
         format of the operation had to be changed from a DPL supplemental to an
         emergency operation half-way through the process, in July 2005;
         (b) the quality of the analysis of information on the emergency and its economic
         impact;
         (c) the anticipation and mitigation of possible disbursement delays arising from
         administrative problems, such as had occurred under the previous Emergency
         Drought Recovery Project

(b) Quality of Supervision


                                                                                              9

(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory. Since the grant disbursed within three months of effectiveness,
there was only one supervision mission, which occurred in November 2005 after
implementation had started, and was focused on minimizing the possibility of delays in
the disbursement of the Grant.      Consistent with the design of the operation, which did
not seek to control the end-use of the grant, there was no further supervision mission after
the grant disbursed, since there was nothing to supervise (and no need to impose a further
burden on client capacity). An additional mission was carried out to prepare this ICR, in
consultation with the Government, development partners, and other stakeholders.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating:      Highly satisfactory.      The Government acted early and convincingly to
determine the extent and nature of the emergency. It worked closely with donors to
ensure that the extent of the emergency was understood, and it ensured that the
macroeconomic and fiscal implications of the emergency were understood and acted
upon in conjunction with its 2005/6 budget and the PRGF program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory. The RBM took the lead in organizing the disbursement
process through the Implementation Committee.           In particular, it was proactive in
gathering documentation in a timely manner and in ensuring a quick response from the
Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
        (a) Design of instrument. The emergency recovery assistance policy outlined in
OP 8.50 is within the framework of investment lending and therefore only provides for
fast-disbursing assistance through the mechanism of a positive import list. In this case,
where the objective was not to supply specific imports and or facilitate particular
expenditures related to the emergency, but rather to cushion the impact on an economy
highly vulnerable to external shocks, the positive list did not play any substantive role. In
effect, free foreign exchange and budgetary resources were being provided. The impact
of the Bank's policy, in this case, was therefore to create unnecessary work both for the
implementing agency and for itself.

        The Bank should therefore consider whether direct disbursement, as is now
carried out for development policy assistance, can be permitted for emergency assistance
in certain circumstances ­ for example, where the adverse impact of macroeconomic



                                                                                          10

disruption is likely to be severe but reversible within the existing policy framework, (e.g.
a PRGF).

       (b) Planning for emergencies. Malawi has suffered severe droughts and/or
floods three times within the last ten years. The MGDS and the Bank's CAS give
considerable attention to both emergency prevention, (e.g. through expanded irrigation)
and to mitigation, (e.g. through better early warning and social safety nets). However, the
structure of Malawi's economy, with high dependence on primary agricultural exports
and resulting strong seasonality in foreign exchange flows, means that the country's
vulnerability to external shocks is likely to remain for some time to come.            The
probability that a response similar to the MERG by the Bank and other donors will be
needed within the next three years is quite high.

       The Government and its partners should consider whether the macroeconomic
effects of a future such emergency could be better provided for, either by targeting a
larger build up of foreign exchange reserves, or by the development of better insurance
instruments, like call options.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies.
       The only comments raised by Borrower during the ICR mission are covered under
6 (a) above. Borrower representatives interviewed expressed a high degree of satisfaction
with all aspects of the operation.

(b) Cofinanciers.
       There was no formal cofinancing. Development partners participating in the
CABS (Common Approach to Budget Support) strongly endorsed the concept of the
MERG and confirmed having been briefed about it ex ante. They did not receive a
briefing ex post, and it is not clear that a separate briefing on the completion of the
operation would have made sense. There appear to have been adequate opportunities to
review the overall impact of external financing on the emergency in 2005/06.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)
       NGOs and private sector representatives were generally aware that the Bank had
made an emergency grant, but were unfamiliar with the details. NGO/civil society
representatives' impressions were dominated mainly by the poor experience of the
previous Drought Emergency Recovery Project (to mitigate the impact of the 2001/02
climatic shocks and approved by the Board in 2003) and were pleased that the MERG
had been handled more promptly and efficiently.          One private sector representative,
while supporting the operation, expressed concern that the totality of emergency and
budget support to Malawi was supporting an unsustainable exchange rate. This is, and
should continue to be, a subject for further dialogue with the Government.

I.  INTRODUCTION

1.  In 2005 Malawi faced the worst food crisis in more than a decade.
    More than 4.2 million people, (over 34 percent of the population) were unable to
    meet their food needs. Production of maize, Malawi's most important staple crop,
    was estimated at nearly 30 percent lower than the year before, itself a shortage
    year. In addition, exceptionally heavy rains in December 2004 and January 2005
    caused flooding and crop losses, especially in the southern and central part of the
    country. Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), revealed a huge
    drop in incomes of over a third of Malawi's population as a result of crop failure.
    Importation of additional maize became critical in order to sustain productivity
    and maintain regular nutrition levels among the population.

2.  Failure in agricultural production due to the drought led not only to severe hunger
    crisis which created unprecedented heavy demand for imported maize and related
    food items, but also severely affected the country's output level and the broader
    macroeconomic aggregates for 2005. This resulted into a reduction in projected
    GDP growth from 4.8 % to as low as 2.1 % (World Bank 2005: 2). The crisis
    affected domestic investment and production because the exceptional food import
    requirements placed a severe constraint on the regular imports critical to
    economic production, notably petroleum, fertilizer, machinery, and construction
    materials. The disruption to trade and economic activity caused by the drought
    eroded business confidence and imposed additional losses on the economy as a
    whole.

3   The Government of Malawi had concluded a new PRGF program with the IMF
    in August 2005. If the humanitarian aspects of the crisis were to be successfully
    mitigated and if sound domestic macroeconomic and structural policies were
    maintained, the Malawian economy could achieve growth rates of 5-6 percent per
    year over the next few years. Reaching this level of growth however, required
    external financing by the donor community in 2005 as well as a strong recovery
    of smallholder production and investor confidence that would feed into strong
    manufacturing growth from 2005 onwards. This would in turn minimize any
    adverse effects on the operations of trade transactions which are instrumental to
    quick economic recovery.

4.  This situation called for a quick response from the Government of Malawi and its
    cooperating partners. As a result in September 2005, the World Bank Board of
    Executive Directors approved an International Development Association (IDA)
    grant of US$30 million to support emergency recovery activities in Malawi. This
    report covers implementation and utilization of the Grant and assesses the extent
    to which the planned grant objectives were achieved.




                                                                                    20

II  OBJECTIVES, IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIENCE

    Objective

5.  The objective of the EERG was to facilitate economic recovery and provide
    support to investment and production, notably agricultural production and to
    return growth to levels consistent with the Government's macroeconomic
    program Specifically, the grant provided an additional SDR20.8 million (USD30
    million) to allow critical private sector imports for the restoration of assets,
    investment and production to take place with the least disruption to the economy.
    The domestic financial resources generated by the grant were to be used for
    financing the approved Government of Malawi's budget, including expanded
    safety nets and other costs associated with the drought. This further allowed the
    Government of Malawi to reduce domestic debt levels and maintain spending
    levels in line with the targets of the IMF PRGF program.


    Implementation

6.  Duration:       In the agreement the project was supposed to be implemented over
    12 months with disbursement completed in the first six months after effectiveness.
    The closing date was 31st December 2006. Due to high demand for forex the total
    grant was disbursed within two months. The closing date was 31st December 2006.

7.  Organizational Arrangements: The project was implemented by Ministry of
    Finance in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of Malawi. The Reserve Bank of
    Malawi was responsible for managing and operating the project's account,
    preparing disbursement requests and maintaining records and details of all
    transactions used to claim reimbursement under the project as per the agreed
    positive list. Further, an Evaluation Committee (EvC) was set up to assess import
    documents prepared by RBM as justification for the disbursement of funds under
    the grant. This committee was made up of officials from MoF, MRA and WBk
    country office. The main responsibility of the committee was to verify the
    relevance and accuracy of statement of expenditures (SOEs) compiled by RBM
    using executed import documents. The EvC was to ensure that all withdrawal
    applications were vetted by the WBk Country Office through the EvC before
    submitting to the Disbursement Office in South Africa.

8.  Disbursement: The initial disbursement plan for funds under this operation was
    for a period ranging from the fourth quarter of 2005 to at least the last quarter of
    2006 with project closing date of 31st December 2006. However, due to increased
    demand for forex to pay for critical imports such as petroleum and petroleum
    products as well as agricultural inputs and equipment, the total grant amount
    (USD29.89 million) was disbursed within two months from the date of
    effectiveness. Details of actual items procured are provided in Annex 1. As
    indicated in this Annex, over 75 percent of the total grant amount was utilized on
    financing petroleum and petroleum products. This reflects the high demand for


                                                                                     21

    fuel necessary for transportation of maize and food related goods for humanitarian
    assistance. This high figure was also due to increased world oil prices which
    contributed negatively to the country's low economic performance in 2005 among
    other factors. The country used most of its forex in importation of maize and
    fertilizers resulting in heavy depletion of forex needed for the other imports. Thus
    the EERG resources contributed substantially towards cushioning the effects of
    forex shortage.

9.  The speedy disbursement of funds was in part as a result of flexibility on the part
    of the WBk in terms of restrictions on the levels of financing to particular
    designated import category. This was crucial as it meant that GoM could apply
    the proceeds to high demand goods as long as they formed part of the positive list.

10. The establishment of an EvC also smoothened the process in that all withdrawal
    applications would be reviewed by the committee and WBk Country Office
    before submission to the Disbursement Office. This eliminated disbursement
    delays making it possible for the operation to disburse funds in less than three
    months. The project is one of the fast track operations implemented in Malawi
    with only three withdraw applications processed within one and half months,
    compared to the projected twelve months disbursement period.


III ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PROJECT

11. Import Financing: The EERG resources contributed significantly to forex
    available for financing of imports in Malawi. The grant was released at the
    appropriate time when the country's foreign exchange position was low. This
    explains the speed at which these funds were utilized. Three withdraw
    applications were processed between 7th November and 19th December 2005 as
    opposed to an estimated six months withdrawal period in the agreement.
    Petroleum and petroleum products used up the largest portion (75.24 percent)
    followed by industrial spares, raw materials, and intermediate inputs and
    machinery for industry and services which utilized 9.67 percent of the grant
    amount. The agricultural inputs and equipment sector was third at 8.54 percent
    utilization of the grant funds.

12. Fiscal Contribution: Implementation of the EERG operation resulted into
    revenue generation of K3.7 billion as indicated in Annex 1. This reflects 100
    percent generation and transfer of resources into MG 1 account in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 contrary to the projected 40 percent. The high demand for forex as
    noted in 6.2.1 above and subsequent quick disbursement, explains the
    corresponding fast generation and transfer of local currency into MG 1 account.
    Thus GoM had access to funding amounting to K3.7 billion from the fourth
    quarter of 2005.

13. The grant contributed to the success of the fertilizer subsidy programme which
    was initially under programmed at K2.8 billion compared to the final cost of K5.7
    billion.


                                                                                     22

14.  The grant formed part of the increase in total grants from 13.7 percent in 2004/05
     fiscal year to 17.5 percent in the 2005/2006 fiscal year.

15.  Macroeconomic Contribution:           The productive capacity was strengthened
     by the grant in the last quarter of 2005. The macroeconomic contributions of the
     grant were to be felt in 2006.

16.  The grant lessened the need for the government to borrow from the general public
     which would have resulted in increased domestic debt.


IV. PERFORMANCE, FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT AND
     CHALLENGES

     Performance

17.  The Government of Malawi: The Government of Malawi was very committed to
     the objectives of the Grant and ensured that all necessary documentation was in
     place for the disbursement applications. At the preparation stage the Ministry of
     Finance and the Reserve Bank of Malawi drew a proposed positive list for imports
     to be financed under the Grant. The Ministry of Finance together with the Reserve
     Bank of Malawi mobilised import documents and prepared statements of
     expenditures to support withdrawal applications in good time. Regular meetings
     were held by the EvC, which helped to have all funds disbursed within two
     months from the effective date of the Grant.

18.  The World Bank:         The WBk's overall performance was very satisfactory. The
     WBk was very instrumental in the planning stages of the grant by providing
     necessary information and guidance in the design of the grant. The WBk showed
     good cooperation by accepting to remove some restrictions on imports and that
     the positive list be formulated based on the structure of Malawi's imports.

19.  During implementation, the WBk was cooperative and flexible. The WBk
     accepted that an Evaluation Committee be formed to look at import documents
     before an application could be forwarded to WBk Regional Office in South
     Africa. This decision was very instrumental to the speedy disbursement of the
     Grant.

20.  The Evaluation Committee:The establishment of an Evaluation committee
     (EvC) contributed to the smooth processing of withdraw applications. The
     departments/ministries represented on the EvC were very cooperative and
     dedicated to the activities of the committee as evidenced by full attendance at all
     meetings of the committee

21.  Challenges: The initial period of implementation of the EERG operation had a
     number of challenges which arose due to misunderstanding on relevant import
     documents. Malawi is a landlocked country with most of its imports coming by
     road transport from the sea ports in Beira in Mozambique and Dar es Salaam in
     Tanzania. This meant that standard bills of lading could not be applicable as the


                                                                                    23

    road transport operators use road consignment notes which rarely bear reference
    to the Bills of Lading available to the shipping lines. This created a number of
    complications since the finance contract referred to a Bill of Lading as the legal
    import document evidencing receipt of goods in Malawi. However, it was
    mutually agreed between project management and the Task Team Leader to
    accept road consignment notes instead of Bills of Lading. This was after thorough
    consultation with relevant customs officials.


V.  SUSTAINABILITY AND FUTURE OPERATIONS OF
    SIMILAR PROJECTS

22. The overall project design was in such a way as to address an emergency situation.


VI  CONCLUSION

    The EERG is one of the IDA successful grants implemented in Malawi. The grant
    came at the critical period when the country the much needed relief maize and
    fertilizer. It helped the economy to sustain productive operations by making
    available additional. The importation of fertilizer and fuel under this grant played
    a role in the implementation of the fertilizer subsidy programme and to the better
    crop harvest in the 2006.
