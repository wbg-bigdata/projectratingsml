3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the Railways Restructuring Project (RRP) was to contribute to Malawi's
economic growth through revitalizing the poorly-operated Nacala rail route, which is shorter and less
expensive than other alternative routes currently followed. This would result in an increase in the Nacala



rail route's share of Malawi's overseas traffic and reduce landed cost of exports/imports thereby enhancing
Malawi's competitive advantage. The basic strategy to achieve this objective comprised: (i) restructuring,
commercialization, and eventual privatization of the Railways and the Lake Services, enabling them to
operate more efficiently; (ii) formulating and implementing a transport policy aimed at promoting genuine
inter-modal and inter-route competition; and (iii) setting-up an institutional mechanism for close
coordination among the entities managing the Nacala rail route, viz., Malawi Railways, the railways on the
Mozambican side, and the Port of Nacala, to ensure sustainability of improved operations on the Nacala
rail route. The project objectives were supportive of the efforts of the Govemment of Malawi to revitalize
the transport sector.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Although part of the credit was canceled in 1998, the project objectives were not revised during
implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
The total cost of the project, inclusive of physical and price contingencies, was estimated at US$29.0
million, with financing by: IDA= US$16.16 million (56%), USAID= US$11.98 million (41%) and GOM=
US$0.86 million (3%).
The project comprised four components:
(a)    Restructuring of Malawi Railways Limited (MRL), a company that was registered in UK prior to
Malawi's independence and at the time of project formulation was responsible for managing the
railways as well as the lake services. The proposed restructuring of MRL involved: (a)
incorporation of two new companies, one for the railways and the other for the lake services; (b)
formalization of relationships between the newly incorporated companies and the Government
through performance contracts; (c) retrenchment of surplus staff; (d) disposal of surplus assets;
and (e) eventual winding-up of MRL.
(b)    Railway revitalization and privatization. The main objective of the component was to facilitate
the privatization of the railways through concessioning and enable it to increase the Nacala rail
route's share of Malawi's overseas freight traffic. The component involved financing: (i) key items
of rehabilitation of infrastructure and operating assets to enable MIRL to improve its operating
efficiency while awaiting privatization; (ii) consultancy and advisory services to assist in
developing privatization options for the railways, preparing bidding documents, managing the
bidding process, negotiations, and finalizing the privatization/concession agreement; and (iii)
setting up of an institutional mechanism for effective coordination of the railways in Malawi and
Mozambique.
(c)    Lake Services and Ports revitalization and privatization. The main objective of this component
was to facilitate the privatization of Malawi lake services and ports and enabling them to increase
their share of Malawi's freight and passenger traffic. The component involved financing: (i) key
items of rehabilitation the operating assets of Malawi Lake Services Limited (MLS) in order to
improve its operating efficiency while awaiting privatization/concessioning; and (ii) consultancy
and advisory services to assist in developing privatization options for the lake services and ports,
preparing bidding documents, managing the bidding process, negotiations, and finalizing the
privatization/concession agreement.

(d)    Transport policy. The main objective of this component was to strengthen the institutional capacity
of the Ministry of Transport for analyzing the performance of the transport sector, providing
adequate response, and developing a transport policy aimed at improving the performance of the
transport sector.
Component costs were estimated as follows:
Proiect Cost Initial Estimates
(US$ million)
Component                     Total Cost   IDA Credit
Restructuring of MRL                                 8.27
Railway Revitalization and Privatization            18.25         15.40
Lake Service & Ports Revitalization and Privatization  1.23        0.76
Transport Policy                                     1.25
Total                             29.001.1
3.4 Revised Components:
During implementation, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended to adjust the project
activities to the changing environment and the RRP cost was revised to US$12.0 million. The changes
were made in response to the following:
(i) USAI]D decided to support the financing of staff retrenchment through a separate Program, under which
about US$20.0 million was made available to GOM through various tranches on fulfillment of certain
conditions, which included downsizing of the railways and retrenchment of staff and private concessioning
of railways. As a result, USAID's contribution to the RRP was curtailed to US$2.2 million for financing
of consultants and technical assistance, this being in addition to the Program assistance of US$20 million;
and
(ii) as the project advanced and the Government prepared to concession the railways, it became clear from
the concessioning experience elsewhere that investments by the parastatals were not always valued by the
potential bidders and there was a real danger that the value of many of the investments would have been
discounted considerably by the propective bidders. In consultations with the Government, all initial
investments were subjected to a rigorous examination and, even though included under the project, many
sub-components were dropped or significantly reduced. Consequently, about US$9.0 million of the total
Credit was canceled in phases.

The life of the project was initially set at three years. The closing date was extended once for one year and
further for three months for the completion of an item pertaining to the supply of gang trolleys.
3.5 Quality at En"ry:
The following specific measures were built into the system to ensure that: (i) the project objectives were
achieved; and (ii) in case, for some reason, achievement of these objectives was delayed or put at risk, the
project could be discontinued at minimum cost.
Emphasizing cost reduction and organizational effectiveness. Restructuring Malawi Railways (MR) and
retrenchment of surplus staff was a key condition of Credit effectiveness. This condition of effectiveness
required GOM to: (a) operationalize the two newly incorporated companies, viz., Malawi Railways (1994)
Limited (MR94) and Malawi Lake Services (MLS); (b) transfer staff and assets that were identified by the
new companies from MR to the new companies; (c) retrench staff not selected for transfer to the new
companies; and (d) appoint an administrator for MR to commence disposal of surplus assets including real
estate. In meeting this condition, out of MR's 3,600 staff, only about 1,200 staff were absorbed by the
new companies and the remaining staff were retrenched; and, in the case of the railways, less than 50% of
the operating assets were transferred to the new company. In the event of delay in the privatization of
Malawi Railways and the Lake Services, the starting conditions (lean, trim and restructured new companies
under new management) were expected to place the railways and the lake services in a better condition to
increase their share of freight and passenger traffic and reduce losses.
Maintainingfocus on privatization. The main objective of the project, viz., privatizing the railways, was
quite ambitious considering that: (a) internationally, not many railways had been privatized and very little
privatization experience was available at the time of project formulation; (b) privatization would have
triggered further staff retrenchments and, consequently, more union opposition; and (c) there was
deep-rooted suspicion of privatization within the government on fears and perceptions that it could lead to
assets stripping, profiteering, and neglect of public service obligations by the successful bidders. Even
though GOM had agreed in principle to the privatization of the railways, there was considerable risk that
pressure from trade unions, politicians, or other vested interests may lead to delay or the abandonment of
the privatization agenda. To maintain the focus of the project and restrict the level of investments in case
GOM delayed or deviated from the goal of railway privatization, the project provided for making a major
part of the project investment, about 70%, conditional on a satisfactory mid-term review.

Promoting effective use of idle assets. The project provided for the sale of surplus assets that were not
taken over by the new companies. MR owned considerable real estate, which was lying idle. It was
reasoned that the sale of these assets, while not adversely affecting the railways' performance, would lead
to two clear benefits: (a) the surplus land/buildings would be put to economic use elsewhere in the
economy; and (b) the realization from the sale would enable the railways to liquidate their short and
long-tern liabilities. In actual practice, both the above expectations have been realized. After discharging
most liabilities, MRL has a positive bank balance of about MK 20.0 million.
Effective management during transition. The project had stressed the need for the new companies to be
managed by competent chief executives and, therefore, had insisted on the chief executives being selected
from the open market through a transparent process managed by a professional, independent body. While
this approach was followed, the response to the advertisements was poor and eventually the staff of MRI
ended up in the top management positions. This was a definite setback for the railways and since the
railway privatization (concessioning) was around the corner, nothing was done to strengthen the
management. This obviously did not prove to be a good idea as the concessioning was delayed and the
performance of the railways remained somewhat stagnant. This could be a significant lesson for the future.
Corridor approach. It was clear from the beginning that the performance of Malawi Railways, as far as
international traffic was concerned, depended on efficient functioning of all the three entities comprising the
Nacala corridor, i.e., the Malawi side of the railway link, Mozambique side of the rail link, and the port of
Nacala. The possibility of the two sides proceeding with the privatization of all the three systems at the
same time appeared remote. The project, therefore, made Credit effectiveness conditional on two
corridor-irelated actions: (a) MR94 and Mozambique Port and Railway Company (Portos e Caminhos de
Ferro de Mocambique, E.P - CFM) signing a wide-ranging Operations Agreement to enable extended run
of trains in each other's system; and (b) MR94 and CFM setting up a Joint Review Board to sort out
operational problems. Even though MR94 and CFM did not make effective use of the Agreement, the
existence of the Operations Agreement nevertheless enabled the concessionaire that took over the railways
in December 1999 to start operating trains across the border soon after taking over. The Joint review
Board met regularly and its meetings contributed to resolving operational problems as they arose.
Financial supportfrom GOM. It was anticipated that it would take some time for MR94 to increase the
level of iraffic and be financially self-sustaining. The project, therefore, required GOM to compensate
MR94 for the losses on the passenger services, which MR94 was required to provide as public service
obligations. This was meant to prevent MR94 from cutting back on maintenance. In practice, the financial
support was provided but with irregular frequency and that did adversely affect the railway's performnance;
Restructuring of Malawi Railways Limited (MRL). The restructuring of MRL in advance of the proposed
concessioning of railways was meant to improve the railways' operational and financial performance and
make surplus land and real estate available to other sectors of the economy during the time it would have
taken for the concessioning process to be completed, estimated between two and three years. The
incorporation of new companies was expected to: (i) allow the two key functions - operations and
downsizing - to be managed by separate entities with appropriate expertise and mandate, operations by the
newly incorporated companies and the retrenchment of surplus staff and disposal of surplus assets by the
old company MIRL; (ii) allow new companies to start with the right set of conditions for improving
performance - no surplus staff, staff selected on the basis of competence and merit, no surplus assets, no
outstanding debt or debt service obligations, and a performance contract with the Government committed to
finance the deficit of public service obligations; and (iii) make new companies accountable for their
- 5-



performance, having been left with no frequently-expressed excuses for failure, viz., debt burden, surplus
staff and government interference. The improved performance as a result of restructuring was not only
expected to benefit the economy, but also make the railways more attractive for the potential
concessionaires.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement ofobjective:
The main objective of the project has been Satisfactorily achieved. Revitalization of the Nacala-rail route
is close to being achieved as a result of the privatization (concessioning) of the railways. This was the key
component of the project (with almost 90% weight) and has been successfully completed. The
concessionaires took over the railways and commenced operations on December 1, 1999, one month before
the close of the project. Also, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed by the
Government of Mozambique with the same concessionaires (independently selected) for the concession of
the Mozambican side of the Nacala railway system as well as the port of Nacala. The concessionaires
propose to commence operations on the Mozambican side of the Nacala Corridor by the end of June 2000.
The status of other outcomes related to the main Project objective is as follows:
(a)    Privatization of the Malawi Lake Services. The privatization of Malawi Lake Services was
delayed. For a long time, GOM could not take a decision to go ahead with the privatization of
these services, first, because it felt that the response would be poor and, second, because of
considerable disagreements on whether to offer the services in one integrated lot or in appropriately
unbundled packages. Despite this, the process is now proceeding ahead and is likely to be
concluded before the end of 2000.
(b)    Restructuring of MRL. Considerable progress has been made in selling surplus land, real estate
and assets belonging to MiRL. The formnal winding up of MRL is only awaiting the formal transfer
of unsold assets such as scrap and discarded locomotives and wagons to MR94 or another body to
be specified by GOM and the settlement of a few cases of real estate sales now pending in courts.
(c)    Transport policy. The institutional study (financed by USAID) was completed in June 1999 after
considemble delay. The consultants made recommendations with regard to the legal and regulatory
frameworks for railways, inland waters, shipping, road traffic, transport, and civil aviation; the
organizational restructuring of the Railway, Marine, Civil Aviation and Road Traffic Departrnents
within the Ministry of Transport and Public Works; the computer systems; and the transport data
base. These recommendations were accepted and are currently under implementation, the one most
relevant pertaining to the appointment of a regulator having already been implemented. The
regulator would be responsible for enforcing the safety and environment-related requirements that
have been stipulated in the concession agreement.
(d)   Operational performance. Achievement of performance targets prior to concessioning has been far
below expectations. The overseas traffic increased from 100,000 tons at the start of the project to
only 145,000 tons for the financial year 1998-99 as against the revised target of 300,000 tons. The
rest of the overseas traffic (estimated between 650,000 and 750,000 tons) continued to move
through the port of Durban (about 400,000 tons) and the ports of Beira and Dar Es Salaam (about
150,000 tons). The target for the domestic traffic, however, was achieved with the traffic increasing
from 176,000 tons at the beginning of the project to 210,000 tons by the end of the financial year
- 6 -



1999. A number of factors have contributed to the below-expectation performance: (a) poor
performance of the railway system on the Mozambican side and also of the port of Nacala; (b)
GOM not keeping its side of the Performance Contract and providing the agreed financial support
for the passenger services operated by MR94 as a public service obligation, thus contributing to
insufficient allocation of funds for maintenance; and (c) poor staff morale resulting from the
uncertainty caused by the impending privatization and further staff retrenchment. The performance
should also be viewed in the changed context of reforms implementation. With an increase in
commitment from the Government to privatize the railways and the lake services, substantial
investments aimed at rehabilitation of infrastructure were dropped or significantly reduced due to
reasons explained in section 3.4. This also adversely affected the perfornance of the railways to
some extent. However, the operational and financial performance of MR94 for the year ending
March 31, 1999 has showed some improvement with the operations resulting in a net surplus for the
first time. With the railways having been successfully concessioned, performance is expected to
improve substantially in the coming years. During the first five months of operations under the
concession, the international freight traffic has already shown an increase of about 30% compared
to the same period one year ago.
On the strength of successful privatization of the railways, the rating should have been Highly Satisfactory.
However, poor performance of the railways during the last three years and the non-completion of the lake
services privatization have dragged down the rating to Satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Restructuring component. This component was successfully completed even before the project became
effective as successful completion of the restructuring process was a condition of effectiveness. The tasks
completed under the component included: (i) incorporation and operationalization of two new companies,
one for the railways called MR94 and the other for the lake services called MLS; (ii) transfer of assets and
staff to the new companies from MR; (iii) retrenchment of staff not required by MR94 and MLS; (iv) sale
of most of the real estate and railway houses; and (v) sale of some operating assets. The only task
remaining to be completed is the transfer of assets not sold to MR94 and the formal winding-up of the old
MR.
Revitalization and privatization of railways. There were two sub-components: (i) revitalization of the
railways while waiting to be privatized/concessioned; and (ii) its concessioning. The first sub-component
has been only partially completed. The increase in traffic has been modest compared to the targets (see
Section 4.1). The second and by far the most important sub-component has been fully completed as the
railways have been successfully concessioned and the concessionaire has commenced operations.
Lake Services revitalization and privatization. There were two sub-components: (i) revitalization of the
lake services while waiting to be concessioned/privatized; and (ii) concessioning/privatization of the lake
services and ports. The traffic increase has been very modest compared to the targets. The preliminary
bidding documents for the concessioning of the Malawi Lake Services have already been issued. The
whole process is expected to be completed by the end of 2000.
Transport policy component. The institutional study for the Ministry of Transport has been completed.
The recommendations were discussed by the consultants with the Ministry officials and accepted, some
with some modifications. The recommendation with regard to the regulatory body has been implemented
and a regulator has been named. Most other recommendations have still to be implemented and an Action
Plan has been prepared for the implementation of the other remaining recommendations by the end of the
-7 -



year 2000. In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport is refining the transport policy, which was earlier
sent to the Cabinet for approval but could not be presented to the Cabinet. The transport policy is
proposed to be refined to reflect the different roles and functions of the Government: policy making,
regulation, conceding authority, and owner of infrastructure.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The benefits to the economy were expected to accrue from diversion of Malawi's exports/import traffic
from the longer and more expensive route to the port of Durban, South Africa to the shorter and less
expensive rail route to the port of Nacala. When compared against the estimated project costs, the ERR
was computed as 91%. However, during the four years of implementation, the actual increase in Malawi's
international traffic through the port of Nacala remained much lower than that projected under the project.
This would have resulted in a significant drop in the estimated ERR but for two facts: (a) less than half of
the estimated project cost was actually incurred mainly due to restrictions that were imposed by the
Privatization Commission on large investments in enterprises for which the privatization process had
begun; and (b) the traffic on the Nacala route is expected to grow at a fairly rapid rate from now onwards
as a result of the takeover by the concessionaires. However, in the light of the actual experience so far, the
projections of the freight traffic from now onwards until the year 2005 have been revised downwards to a
maximum of 350,000 tons as compared to 525,000 tons projected in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
The actual benefits have also been decreased by 25% to account for the discounts being offered by the
freight forwarders for export traffic to Durban. As such, despite poor traffic growth and reduced traffic
projections for the coming years, the revised estimated ERR remains not far from the one computed at the
time of project appraisal, i.e., 78%. The major benefits under this Project are expected to come from
improvement of performance as a result of the privatization (concessioning) and not from investments
which explains the high rate of return.
There are other benefits that have accrued under the project but have not been taken into consideration for
computimng the ERR such as: (a) economic benefits from improved operating efficiency for the domestic
traffic; (b) redeployment of retrenched staff in productive employment in other sectors of the economy; and
(c) productive utilization of surplus land, houses, and other assets of MR94 in other productive sectors of
the economy.
4.4 Financial rate of return.
Operating ratio (revenue/expenditure including depreciation) targets were specified under the SAR. These
targets could not be met due to poor growth of freight traffic compared to the one projected. Compared to
the target of about 90% by the end of the years 1998-99, the actual operating ratio was 110%. The
revenues and operating expenditures for the 1996-1999 period are indicated in the table below. The
non-achievement of the targted operating ratio was mainly due to the projected traffic not having been
materialized. However, with the private concessioning of Malawi railways, the soon-expected
concessioning of the Nacala port and the railway system on the Mozambique side, and the expected
quantum jump in operating efficiency, overseas traffic is expected to increase quickly and substantially.
This traffic, as indicated elsewhere, is currently moving through the port of Durban. With the increase in
traffic, the targets for the operating ratio are also expected to be achieved by the year 2002.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a significant impact in terms of institutional development. In the first phase of
restrLcturing, two new companies were set up, one for the railways and the other for the lake services. The
new companies were able to start operations with the right set of conditions for improving performance,
i.e., rio surplus staff, staff selected on the basis of competence, no surplus assets, no outstanding debt or
debt service obligations and a performance contract with the Government committed to finance the deficit
of puLblic service obligations (PSOs). The railway was also concessioned in December 1999. The
institutional study on the Ministry of Transport has been completed and the recommendations are currently
under implementation, and the one most relevant recommendation pertaining to the appointment of a
regullator has been already implemented. The other recommendations pertain to the strengthening the
analytical capacity of the Ministry of Transport and establishing regulatory bodies for the other modes of
transport, and establishing the right legal framework for enhancing competitiveness and efficiency of the
different modes of transport. Most surplus staff has been retrenched and surplus land and assets have been
disposed of.
5. Mlajor Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Improvements on the Nacala rail route were dependent not only upon increasing the efficiency of MRL, but
to a greater extent on improving efficiency of railways on the Mozambican side as well as the port of
Nacala, which were beyond the control of GOM. Part of the delay in issuing of the bidding documents for
selecting consultants to advise the Govermnent on privatizing MR94 was caused by GOM trying to make
the Government of Mozambique agree to use the same terms of reference (TORs) and the same consultant
for the Mozambican side of the Nacala rail route as well as to get the whole corridor concessioned to the
same private operator at the same time through a common bidding process. As this agreement could not be
reached, GOM went ahead with the concessioning process by itself while a parallel process was on-going in
Mozambique.
Operational performance during some of the years (1995/96) was adversely impacted by heavy rains which
resulted in washaways/derailments and consequent closure of the Nacala rail line to traffic.
9-



Operational performance was also negatively affected by perceived inefficiency of the Nacala route by the
customers resulting in continued routing of overseas imports/exports through the port of Durban.
Performance during 1996/97 was affected by the offer of significantly reduced sea fares by a shipping
company for containers loaded at Durban, thus providing incentives for use of the port of Durban. Though
these reductions were unwarranted and, obviously, unsustainable in the face of competition, these
nevertheless did adversely affect the traffic to Nacala for a short period of time. Also, due to imbalance in
Malawi's external trade (imports being twice that of exports), the trucks bringing imported goods from
South Africa are able to offer heavy discounts for the export traffic to Durban, thus making the Durban
route comparatively cheaper for the country's exports. However, once the Nacala rail route i perceived as
efficient and Malawi's imports are routed through the port of Nacala, this situation will automatically
disappear. In addition, heavy investment in road transport vehicles were made by Malawi's business sector
in response to uncertainty of the Nacala route during the past many years. These businessmen are also
competing aggressively with the railways for recovering their capital investments to the extent possible and,
in the short run, offering lower tariffs along the road route to the port of Beira on the basis of marginal
costs.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Inability of the Government to provide for effective management during interim restructuring period,
compromised perfornance of the railways during the initial years.
Delays in payment of compensation for passenger services by the Government, as agreed in the DCA,
impacted adequate maintenance of rail infrastructure.
The Project Implementation Committee (PIC). PIC was established by GOM to monitor the project
implementation. Headed by the Permanent Secretary of the Minister of Finance, its members included the
chief executives of the implementing agencies, the permanent secretaries of the concemed Ministries and
other interested parties. PIC was quite effective in the first year of the project. As a result, the first phase
of restructuring of the old Malawi Railways (MRL), also a condition of effectiveness, was successfully
carried out. However, PIC, though comprising of high government officials, failed to establish an
appropriate mechanism for effectively following through its own decisions. This adversely affected its
effectiveness. In particular, PIC could not enforce the following decisions, which had a considerable
impact on the project outcome: (a) regular and timely payments of the subvention on account of the
passenger services, which was then cited as a reason for poor perforrnance by MR94; (b) timely
finalization of a strategy for the privatization of the Malawi Lake Services; and (c) making MR94
accountable for the achievement of the performance targets agreed by MR94 in the performance contract
signed by MR94 with GOM. The railway privatization component, the key project objective, was
monitored by the Privatization Commission, and, therefore, the inadequate effectiveness of PIC did not
affect the long term objective.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Delayed implementation of actions agreed during supervision missions by MR94 adversely affected: (i)
availability of wagons; (ii) turnaround time for wagons; and (iii) perception of the reliability of the Nacala
route by some customers.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
-1 0 -



As some of the investment components under the project were subsequently dropped during
implementation, there was never a case of inadequate financing of the project components. Disbursements
of funds seriously lagged behind the original estimates partly because GOM failed to provide the 5%
counterpart funds on the grounds that the Government does not have this responsibility for companies
incorporated under the Company Act such as MR94. However, MR94 maintained that it was also unable
to provide the counterpart funds due to GOM having failed to keep its side of the performance contract and
provide agreed financial support for the passenger services operated by MNR94. Subsequently, the DCA
had to be modified to enable 100% payments from the Credit for foreign purchases and 90% payment for
local purchases.
As shown in Annex 2, the final Project cost was US$9.3 million, which represented 32% and 78% of the
initial and revised estimates respectively. The decrease in the Project cost compared to the revised cost was
due to less expenditure by USAID and also due cancellation of a high cosr track rehabilitation component.
This rehabilitation would now be taken up by the concessionaire.
The final Project cost of US$9.3 million was eventually finaced as under: IDA US$6.7 million (72%),
USAID - US$2.2 million (33%) and GOM - US$0.4 million (5%). The IDA Credit disbursements
amounted to 70% of the revised Credit amount of US$9.5 million.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating.
Sustainability is likely. Key component of the project related to concessioning of the railways has been
successfully completed. The concessionaire took over the railways and commenced operations on
December 1, 1999. The new railway company, MR94, is starting with the right set of conditions for
improving performance: no surplus staff, staff selected on the basis of merit, no surplus assets, no
outstanding debt and a performance contract with the Government committed to finance the deficit of
PSOs. The privatization of Malawi Lake Services has been delayed but the process is proceeding ahead
and is likely to be concluded before the end of calender year 2000. The old MR was able to dispose of
almost all surplus real estate and is now awaiting formal closure. The study for institutional strengthening
of the Ministry of Transport was completed in June 1999 and is now under implementation.
6.2 'rransition arrangement to regular operations:
With the signing of the MOU for concessioning Mozambican side of railways and the concessionaires (the
same concessionaire as for Malawi Railways) set to take over the railways the port of Nacala by the end of
June 2000, the stage is set for efficiency improvements along the Nacala corridor. A one-man regulatory
body has also been established but technical assistance in the initial few months is necessary. USAID has
agreed to provide this technical assistance. As part of the Privatization and Utility Reform Project,
currently under preparation (expected to go to Board in the fourth quarter of FY00), the experience with
privatization would continue to be documented and monitored.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification, preparation and appraisal was Satisfactory. The project
was well designed and all aspects were given due attention as explained in Section 3.5.
- 1 1 -



7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance during supervision was Satisfactory. Regular supervision missions took place and
detailed discussions were held with the Government, implementing agencies and other stakeholders. Even
though there were some reservations on the realization of the MRL privatization objective at the time of
project preparation, open discussions with the borrower helped assuage many concerns and paved the way
for railways privatization. The Bank showed flexibility in amending the DCA during supervision to
accommodate the changing context and respond to realities on the ground.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance was Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation.
The Borrower's performance during preparation was Satisfactory. The Borrower fully participated in all
aspects of project design.
7.5 Government implementation performance.
Although PIC could have been more effective, the Borrower's performance during implementation was
Satisfactory. A high level delegation from Malawi went to Mozambique to facilitate concessioning of the
entire Nacala corridor, though not with much success. The government did steadfastly continue to support
the privatization of the railways. The concessioning process was particularly well managed by the
Privatization Commission in terms of the bidding process, bidders' conference, evaluation of the bids,
decision to re-invite the bids and final negotiations.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of MR94 was Satisfactory. Even though the company failed to achieve the key
performance targets, they did face adverse factors such as the continuing poor performance of the Nacala
route on the Mozambique side, heavy rains in one year as a result of which considerable length of track
was damaged, non-payment/delayed payment of agreed subvention for passenger services by the
Government, and poor morale of staff due to the uncertainty facing their future.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower's performance was Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
1. Since the concessioning process usually takes between two to three years to complete, restructuring the
railways (without long-term investments) to start with can produce considerable benefits for the
economy in the interim, as has happened in the case of Malawi Railways. Malawi Railways was
restructured in 1995 and the concessionaires took over the operations in 1999. The benefits that
accrued to the economy during the four years, i.e., after restructuring and before the takeover of the
railways by the concessionaires, comprised: (a) reduction in operating cost of the railways, thus
- 12 -



obviating the need for any financial support from the government; (b) improved accountability of the
newly incorporated railway and lake service companies; (c) sale of surplus land and houses, which
were then put to productive use; and (d) generation of funds from the sale of surplus assets enough to
pay off all the outstanding accounts payable and other external debts. Additionally, a downsized
railway without any outstanding debts also enhanced the attractiveness of the railways for the potential
concessionaires. Restructuring the railways while waiting for the completion of the concessioning
process can lead to reduced losses in the interim. However, the usefulness of long term investments
prior to concessioning appears doubtful as the potential concessionaires are unlikely to fully factor in
these investments in estimating the value of concessions.
2. Even though the interim restructuring of railways yielded considerable benefits as indicated in
paragraph (i) above, the operational performance did not show much improvement and the targets of
international traffic were not achieved. It became apparent during project implementation that, in spite
of restructuring, the fact that the railways continued to operate within a parastatal framework made the
improvements in performance difficult to achieve. A parastatal framework, associated as it is with
inadequate staff motivation, commitment, and accountability, is not appropriate for the railways,
especially in an intensely competitive business environment. Private sector participation in the
operation and management of railways (henceforth referred to as privatization) appears essential for
improving their performance and making them operate as financially self-sustaining entities.
3. Whether managed as it is or through private participation, the railways are unlikely to become
financially viable unless surplus staff is retired/retrenched. Even though retrenchment of staff is a
politically and socially sensitive issue and difficult to implement, the issue has to be addressed.
Effective retrenchemnt of surplus staff (about 70% of the original staff strength) during the first phase
of restructuring did result in a very substantial decline in the railway losses and also made the railway
much more attractive for the prospective concessionaires.
4. Even though the railway was restructured with the expectation that the Nacala corridor's share of the
international traffic will start increasing even as the concessioning process was underway, the
expectation did not materialize and the international traffic increased only marginally. One of the main
reasons for this inadequate performance was the inability of the government to get the right
management personnel to manage the railways in the interim. An effort was made to extend the
selection process to experts outside the railways but the response was quite poor. Since a decision to
concession the railway had already been taken and the mandate of the management of the new railway
company pertained to a very short period of time, spending time and money on building internal
management capacity was clearly not justified, nor was there any willingness on the part of the
management to take part in a such an effort. Under such circumstances, the best decision would have
been to engage short-term outside experts. It is important to ensure effective management of the
railways during the concessioning process, even if it means engaging expatriates.
5. The concessioning experience elsewhere suggests that investments by the parastatals are not always
valued by the potential bidders and there is a real danger that many of the investments could be
considerably devalued. All investments prior to concessioning, therefore, need to be subjected to a
rigorous technical and financial evaluation. To the extent possible, all long-lived investments prior to
concessioning should be avoided.
6. The Government of Malawi was initially keen to collaborate with the Government of Mozamnbique and
issue one bidding document for the concession of the whole Nacala port railway system in order to
facilitate selection of one concessionaire for the whole system. However, due to difference in the
- 13 -



approach of the two govemments with regard to the concessioning process and selection of the
concessionaires, agreement to issue one bidding document could not be achieved. At that stage, the
Government of Malawi decided to go ahead with the concession for Malawi Railways independent of
the actions of the Government of Mozambique, in spite of the risk of the independent Malawi Railway
concession proving less attractive to bidders. In actual practice, the propective concessionaires were
able to manage the process on both sides of the corridor and eventually the concessionaire identified for
both sides of the corridor has turned out to be the same. An imnportant lesson of this process is that,
while concession of a corridor, wherever applicable, is desirable, it may not be a good idea to delay the
privatization process on this account. The role of the potential concessionaires in bringing about a
working ararngement for the corridor as a whole should not be underestimated.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency.
MALAWI RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Reference is made to the ICR made available to me on Wednesday 21s- June 2000 for my comments.
I wish to congratulate the Bank for this comprehensive ICR which provides an accurate account of the
project in as far as this Ministry is concemed.
The above said, I have the following minor comments to make:-
(a)        Transport Policy Component para 4.2.
The National Transport Policy has been finalised and approved by the Cabinet Committee on
Transport. Our understanding is that the policy document is acceptable to the Bank as indicated during
the last World Bank Mission. We agree that the policy is not a static document in that it is subject to
further review.
(b)        Project Implementation committee para 5.2
As you are aware, in Malawi Heads of Ministries are Principal Secretaries and the PIC Chairman was
the Secretary to the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance.
(c)        Sustainability para 6.1
The new Railway Company is the Central and East African Railways (CEAR).
Regarding the PSO obligations, I would like to state that a recent study by the Privatisation Commission
indicated that the passenger services are profitable operations both on Malawi Railways and Lake
Services. It would appear then that Govemment will be paying CEAR for profitable operations. How I
wished this was done before the concession agreement was signed. It is my hope that this will be
taken into account in the MLS exercise.
(d)        Lessons learned para 8(vi).
On the Mozambique side the idea was the concessioning of the whole railway system including the port.
I hope you find the foregoing useful.

10. Additional Information
Since the commencement of the concession on December 1, 1999, both the working environment and the
railways' performance have shown a significant visible improvement. The staff appear motivated and
enthusiastic. Compared to similar period one year ago, the freight traffic during the first four months
(December 1999 to March 2000), both international and local, is up by 50%, and the passenger traffic by
about 35%. The parcel, baggage and mail traffic has increased twenty-fold. Overall revenues are up by
about 50%. The revenues from passenger traffic is up due probably to improved punctuality and
cleanliness and better control on ticketless travel. Locomotive and rolling stock availability, chronic
constraints in the past, improved to 85% and 90% respectively. To improve fuel traffic, tank wagons are
being calibrated to ensure that the losses in transit can be accurately measured and contained within the
allowable percentage. Calibration of about 30% tank wagons has already been completed. The
concessionaire has also broken new ground and commenced operating trains across the border using its
own locomotives all the way from Blantyre to Nacala and the other way round. This is already beginning
to have an impact on transit times and, obviously, has a great potential. Enhancing staff motivation and
accountability, improving interactions and communications with staff, daily monitoring of the previous
day's performance, effective use of the UNCTAD wagon tracking system and other management and
operations software, improving the quality of maintenance, and building customer confidence appear to be
the top priorities of the concessionaire.
