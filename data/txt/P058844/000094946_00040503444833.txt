General
1. General Introduction
The expressway from Zhumadian to Xinyang (boundary), is one part of Bejing-
Zhuhai National Trunk Highway (NTH). It starts from the terminal of Luohe-
Zhumadian Expressway, which is now under construction, and goes southward along
Beijing-Guangzhong Railway and the eastern side of National Highway (NH) 107. It
passes through Zhumadian City, Queshan, Minggang, Pinqiao District, Luoshan
County and shall connect the Juliguan in Hubei Province, with a total length of
133.79km. It is planned that this expressway project shall be commenced in 2000 and
completed in 2002. By that time, an expressway shall be continuous from Beijing to
Xinyang, which shall play an important role in economical development since its
characteristic of being comfortable, fast and safe.
The linking highways, as the attachments to the expressway, shall function as the
conversion and diversion of the traffic flow and shall impact directly the integrate
profit of the expressway. Along Zhumadian Xinyang Expressway,. there are five
linking highways-Zhumadian Linking Highway, Quanshan Linking Highway and
Minggang Linking Highway, which locates in Zhumadian Prefecture to connect the
local highways to the Expressway. Fenjiatang Linking Highway (in Pingqiao District,
Xinyang City) and Guopeng Linking Highway, which locates in Xinyang City to
connect the local highways to the Expressway. The details of the linking highways are
shown as follows:

2. Target and Principle for Resettlement
The target of resettlement for the linking highways is to maintain the living standard
and productive viability of the local residence affected by the land requisition and
removal (or to resume and improved within one year).
The prihciple for resettlement is to make as fewer as land requisition and removal as



possible.
3. For linking highways, the total permanent land requisition shall be 742.5mu,
temporary land requisition shall be 687.3mu and the total house removal-shall be
11 ,941sq.m. So the total compensation shall be 23.569949 billion-yuan (RMB).



I. Project Background
1. Description of the Project and Its Major Purpose
According to the schedule made by Henan Provincial Communications Department,
the Pre-feasibility Study for Zhumadian-Xinyang Expressway shall be completed in
May 1998 and its Feasibility Study completed in August 1998, and at present, the
Preliminary Design shall be on the way. In November 1999, the bid for construction
shall start and construction mobilization shall be made by the end of the year 1999,
then the commencement of the construction. In 2002, the expressway shall be
completed and open to traffic. Therefore, the linking highways, as the attachment
facilities of the expressway, shall be constructed as synchronously with the
construction of the expressway as possible to ensure the operation profit of the
expressway (after completion and open to traffic).
The linking highways shall connect the expressways with the interchanges. In order to
construct the linking highways as synchronously with the construction of the
expressway as possible, based on the requirement made by the World Bank, the
highway organizations in Zhumadian Prefecture and Xinyang City have made special
arrangements. The Engineers form Zhumadian and Xinyang shall make detailed plan
and study to the linking highways respectively according to the Feasibility Study of
Zhumadian-Xinyang Expressway and the general plan of the interchanges & linking
highways. They will focus on the issue that the linking highways intersecting the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and try to make sure the construction standard of the
linking highways can meet the requirement of long-run traffic volume, so as to ensure
the operation profit of the expressway after completion and open to traffic.
2. Regions Affected and Benefited by the Projec
The expressway from Zhuniadian to Xinyang directly influences Zhumadian
Prefecture and Xinyang City, including 12 counties or districts under their
administration: Qinyang, Runan, Queshan, Pingyu, Suiping, Shangcai, Xincai,
Zhengyang, Pingqiao, Luoshan, Xixian and Guangshan as well as Luohe City and
Hubei Province. It will influence indirectly 5 counties including Xinxian, Huangchuan,
Huaibin, Gushi and Shangcheng as well as Nanyang City, Zhoukou Prefecture and
Anhui Province. The construction of 95.52km long expressway shall bring vigorous
development for the above-mentioned areas, which are main grain, cotton and edible
oil producers in Henan Province. Also the investment environment shall be improved
and the economical development shall be promoted. It will make great role in poverty
fighting.
3. Social and Economical Background of the Regions Affected by the Project
Zhumadian Prefecture is located in the south of Henan Province with total area of
15,083Sq.m, 753,000 ha. of which is cultivated land. Its total population is 7.89
million, in which 7.04 million are agricultural people and 850,000 nonagricultural
3



people. Its population density is 523person/per square meter. The average cultivated
land per capita is 1.6mu. The main scope for agriculture includes grain, cotton and
edible oil. Main industry sections include non-metal development, building materials,
medicine, textile, machinery, electricity and chemistry. Its main products include
cigarette, beverage, alcohol, textile products, machine-made paper, paper plate,
synthetic ammonia, plastic products and cement. Its GDP in 1997 was 22.509 billion-
yuan, average 2,806 yuan per capita, ranking the 15th in 17 cities and prefectures in
the province.
Xinyang City, which connects with Hubei Province, is located in the south end of
Henan Province. It has 18,915sq.m of land with 520,000ha. cultivated land. It has 7.6
million people including 6.6 million agricultural people and 1 million non-agricultural
people. The population density is 402 per square meter. The average cultivated land
per capita is 1.2mu. The main scope for agriculture includes grain, cotton, red ramie
and tea. Main industry sections include machinery, electricity, medicine, building
materials, foodstuff, feedstuff, textile and chemistry. There are 38 kinds of explored
valuable mine resources, including serpentine and pearlite whose storage ranks first in
China. Its GDP in 1997 was 22.054 billion-yuan, average 2,785 yuan per capita,
ranking the 16th in 17 cities and prefectures in the province.
Zhumadian Prefecture and Xinyang City are both under-developed regions in
economy of the province. The backward situation in economy needs to be improved.
4. Measures Taken to Minimum Migrants
A lot of work has been done to minimum the influence caused by land requisition at
the stage of feasibility study of the project. The alignment of this proposed
expressway is determined according to the result of aerial photography, the land and
the buildings to be influenced can be clearly distinguish in the photograph.
In order to minimum the influence to the local people caused by land requisition of
this project, Henan Provincial Communications Planning, Survey & Design Institute
discussed with the leaders of highway construction departrnents and local
governments along the route to work out the scheme of alignment. A 1:2000
topographic map is finally adopted, with the purpose to take the influence of removal
and resettlement into consideration, to determine the scheme of alignment. From the
stage of preliminary design, land requisition and migrant resettlement has been the
main factors that decide the project design and alignment. Because a lot of work has
been done in survey and design stage, best efforts have been paid to minimum the
influence of land requisition.
In order to minimum the quantity of land occupation and removal, further adjustment
for horizontal alignment is made during final design period, to avoid the aligmnent
goes through those villages whose population is large. Also, the longitudinal gradient
is reasonably adjusted to shorten the height of fill and the depth of cut, and the
4



interchanges are arranged properly.
In addition, effort shall be made to minimum the influence caused by land requisition
and settlement during construction period. The temporary land used shall be focus on
existing buildings and waste yards (e.g. township enterprises that have been closed).
Also, best effort shall be made to balance the earthwork during construction period,
borrow sources shall be arranged in the waste land or waste hills.
Each of the linking highways shall be designed in such way to not only take the
long/medium term period development of the corresponding cities into consideration,
but also shall use the existed highways as far as possible. For this purpose, two
schemes are made for each of the linking highways to try to minimum the land
occupation and house removal as well as the noise in urban area and the pollution
from the tail gas of the vehicles. During the period of implementation, all of the
temporary land requisitioned shall be resumed to cultivated land. The borrow sources
shall be chosen on the land wasted, and the depth of excavation for the borrow
sources shall be restricted to make sure they can be resumed to cultivated land later.
No matter the land need for temporary use or soil borrowing, no removal and migrant
resettlement shall be made. During the period of land occupancy, besides the
compensation shall be released to the farmers, the labor forces affected shall be
arranged to work on the project as far as possible to increase their income.
5. Economical and Technical Feasibility Study
This project belongs to the attachment facilities of the Zhurnadiam-Xinyang
Expressway, no approval is need from the MOC and SDPC. Its Feasibility Study in on
the way to be approved.
6. The Preliminary Design and Construction Design
Zhumadian Highway Survey & Design Institute and Xinyang Highway Survey &
Design Institute shall be in charge of the survey and design for this project.
7. Ownership and Organizational Structure of the Project
This project belongs to the attachment of the Zhumadiam-Xinyang Expressway, its
maintenance shall be carried out by Highway Administration Bureau of Henan
Provincial Communications Department. During the construction period, the land
requisition and migrant resettlement shall be responsible for by the construction
leading group at different levels and the offices under it.
.-,
8. Social and Economical Survey
The social and economical survey for this project was carried out by the design units
together with the municipal, district, township leading group offices and the
representatives of the farmers affected under the requirement of Provincial
Construction Leading Group Office. The survey period was from March 23, 1999 to
June 4, 1999, totally 74 days. The survey was focus on economical situation of the
s



counties, towns and villages along the linking highways, including basic production
conditions, geological environment, production forms, living habits, living levels,
people constitution, soil quality, attachment quantity, market price of local materials
and the attitude of the local people towards this project. The survey forms mainly
included checking statistic data of 1998,1997 and 1996 in statistical bureaus at county
level, visiting officers at county, township and village levels and the people who are
involved in land requisition and removal. In October, the area of the land
requisitioned and the number of the buildings attached were measured, then the
people involved including the people from the city, county, township offices and the
farmners had signed in the registration table for confirming. All the investigators and
the people who were investigated were very concerned about this investigation. Most
of the local people expressed their supporting to the Fenjiatang Linking Highway
Project. However, when the attachments on the land were verified, arguments were
made more or less, the investigator could take the local people's opinions into
consideration based on the actual situation and handled the problems properly. During
the construction period and within one year after completion of the project, the
follow-up investigations shall be made by the project's management organizations
and the independent monitoring organization, and then an assessment report
concerning the regional social economical condition shall be made by them. Based on
that, ihe further improving measures shall be adopted accordingly.
The investigation group included the following members
(1) Wu Jingshun: Chief of Planning Division of Communication Bureau of
Zhumadian Prefecture, who responsible for investigating the economical condition of
each village, township and county along the proposed highway;
(1) Sun Hailin: Chief of the Design Division of Highway Administration Department
of Zhumadian Prefecture, who responsible for investigating the economical condition
of each village, township and county along the proposed highway;
(3) Zhang Baogang: Chief of Design Division of Highway Management Department
of Xinyang City, who responsible for investigating the economical condition of each
village, township and county along the proposed highway;
(4) Peng Zitao: Chief of Planning Division of Highway Management Department of
Xinyang City, who responsible for investigating the economical condition of each
village, township and county along the proposed highway.
9. Preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan
(1) The design unit shall provide land requisition quantity, attachment quantity and
population affected by land requisition and removal according to Construction Design.
It will also provide economical situation of the project area, traffic volume forecast
after completion of this project and the foreseeing of economical development based
on Feasibility Study Report.
(2) Set up migrant resettlement organizations. The construction authorities of this
project at provincial and city levels will be established in December 1999. By that
6



time, the relevant organizations or leading groups in Xinyang and Zhumadian
City/Prefecture, and Pingqiao, Runan, Queshan counties/districts as well as townships
(towns) under their administration will be set up. The leading groups and the offices
will be in charge of passing through land requisition fonnalities, carrying out removal
plan, releasing compensation fee, settling down affected people, guarding social
security, coordinating relationship between the Contractors and local people, solving
problems based on contracts or authorization of the higher authorities.
(3) Giving publicity of the significance of the project and the laws and rules on which
compensation policy is made.

structures. Compensation to farmer is based on market resettlement price. Because
9



most of the farmers have fund deposits, the standard of new buildings shall be higher
than the original ones. According to the investigation, most of the migrants are willing
to built brick concrete houses.

III. Legal Framework
1. Policy
1. Policies on land requisition and migrant resettlement are formulated at three levels
in China.
* Basic policy framework set up by central government through issuing state laws and
enforcement guidelines.
* Comprehensive/special regulations and enforcement methods on carrying out state
laws issued by provincial governments.
- Relevant regulations issued by Prefectures/cities, which are accorded with the
state/provincial laws and regulations, and are only applicable in the specified
jurisdictional areas.
The Resettlement Action Plan is prepared according to the following laws, regulations
and the Guideline of Non-volunteer Migrants (OD4.30) issued by the World Bank.
The implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan shall be based on the said law
framework.
2. Laws and Regulations Regarding Compensation
(1) State laws and regulations
The following laws contain the key policies about land, grassland and forest:
A. "Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China". It is approved by the
16th session of Standing Committee of the 6th National People's Congress in June
1986, and is revised on Aug. 29, 1998. It comes into force since Jan. 1, 1999.
B. "Enforcement Regulations for Land Management Law of People's Republic of
China", it is approved by the Standing Committee of the State Council on April 24,
1998 and comes into force since Jan. 1, 1999.
C. "State Forest Law " and its implementing regulations.
(2) The major provisions of the Land Management Law (the most important part) are
shown as follows:
Ownership
(1) The people's Republic of China carries out socialist public ownership for land.
That is national ownership system and collective ownership system. The land in urban
area belongs to the state. The land in 'countryside and suburb, apart froifi those that

village. The land that has collective ownership belongs to a town/township, shall be*
managed and operated by the countryside economical organization of the
town/township (Clause 10 of "Land Management Law of China").
(3) The land owned by the collective of farmers shall be registered and recorded in the
county government. The certificates to prove the land ownership shall be issued by
the county government after confirmation (Clause 11 of "Land Management Law of
China").
(4) If the purpose of the land ownership is to be changed, it shall registered (Clause 12
"Land Management Law of China").
(5) The ownership and right of utilization of the registered land by law is protected by
law. It is prohibited to violate by any units or individuals (Clause 13 of "Land
Management Law of China").
Land usage
(l) Units or individuals can use the land that belongs to the state and collective of
farmers by law. The land user has the obligations to protect, manage and properly use
the land (Clause 9 of "Land Management Law of China").
(2) Land survey system is set up by the state (Clause 27 of "Land Management Law
of China").
(3) Land statistic system is set up by the state (Clause 39 of "Land Management Law
of China").
(4) The governnents at different levels shall organize to prepare an integral plan for
land utilization according to the plan of social and national economy development,
requirements for state land renovation and environmental protection, land supply
ability and the need of land for constructions (Clausel7 of "Land Management Law
of China").
(5) Cultivated land is strictly controlled being transferred into non-cultivated land.
The state carries out compensation system for cultivated. land occupation. If the
cultivated land is to be transferred to non-agricultural construction land after approval,
the unit that occupy it shall be responsible to cultivate another piece of land with the
same quality and the same amount according to the principle of "Cultivate the same
land as you use". For those who incapable to cultivate or the cultivated land can't
meet the requirement, cultivated land cultivation fee shall be paid according to the
14



relevant regulations. This fee will be specially used in cultivatine new cultivated land
(Clause 31 of "Land Management Law of China").
Land used for state construction
(1) Procedure for approval
If the approved project needs to use state land for construction, the construction unit
shall apply to the land administration authorities above county level that have
approval right with relevant documents of law and administrative regulations. The
application shall be checked by the land administrative authority and reported to the
government at the same level for approval (Clause 53 of "Land Management Law of
China").
(2) Confirmation for approval
Land used by units and individuals for a specific project shall be handled according to
Clause 22 and 23 of "Enforcement regulations of Land Management Law". The
authority of approval to unused state land for construction projects is that: (a) land
less than 2ha. shall be approved by county (city) government; (b) land more than 2 ha.
but less than 4 ha. shall be approved by city ( prefecture) government; (c) land more
than 4 ha. shall be approved by provincial government.
Apart from paid use land, after the project is completed and passed examination for
acceptance, "State Land Use Certificate" shall be issued (Clause 36 of "Execution
Method for Land Management Law in Henan Province"(revised draft)).
2. Laws and Regulations Regarding Standard of Compensation
Permanent land requisition decrees are mainly based on the revised draft of "Land
Management Law" executed in Henan Province (Note: It is approved by the 11th
session of Standing Committee of the 9th National People's Congress in Sep.1999,
and comes into force since Dec. 1, 1999.)
It is marked in Clause 34 of the "Land Management Law" that after the proposal of
land used for construction land is approved, the compensation to the unit whose land
is in requisition shall be executed according to following rules:
(1) Land compensation fee
The requisitioned cultivated land (including vegetable plot) orchard, fish pond, lotus
pond and tea garden in suburb of cities under direct provincial administration shall be
compensated by 8-10 times of the annual output value. Other land in suburb of other
cities, industry/mining areas and towns under direct idministrmtionrofcountysyali be
compensated by 7-9 times of the average annual output value for the last 3 years. The
land in other places shall be compensated by 6-8 times of the annual output value.
In the requisitioned cultivated land, the by-products of crops (vegetables excluded)
shall be calculated by 15-20% of the output of their corresponding main products'.
15



When the orchards where no fruit is growing, newly-built fish pond, lotus pond, reed
pond, tea garden and forest land are requisitioned, the compensation shall be made
according to the lowest standard of the adjacent cultivated land.
For the land used for residence and the collective land used for public facilities,
commonweal benefits or used for individual business, apart from removal subsidy
shall be mad, it shall also be compensated as cultivated land.
(2) Resettlement subsidy
The settlement subsidy for cultivated land and other land requisitioned shall be
calculated according the number of agricultural people to be resettled. That is:
the agricultural people to be resettled = the requisitioned land-.4he average
cultivated land per capita.
The standard of settlement subsidy for each agricultural person to be resettled shall be
4-6 times of the average output value of the corresponding cultivated land in last 3
years.
For suburb under direct administration of the province, it shall be 6 times, For the
suburb of other cities, land in industrial and mineral areas and towns under direct
administration of the county, it shall be 5 times. For other land, it shall be 4 times, but
the settlement subsidy for per ha. shall be no more than 15 times.
(3) Compensation for young crops shall be made according to the output value of one
harvest.
(4) Compensation method and standard for attached buildings shall be executed
according to the regulations made by the provincial government. New attachment
built after land requisition bulletin is issued shall not be compensated.
It is marked in Clause 24 of "Land Management Law" that after land is approved to
be used for a project, the land user shall make cultivated land cultivation scheme for
approval of the authorities in charge of land administration. The land user shall be
responsible for cultivating cultivated land that has the same area and quality of the
land occupied. If the land user is incapable to cultivate or the cultivated land cannot
be accepted, cultivated land cultivation fee shall be paid.
The collection, use and management of cultivation fee shall be regulated in other
regulations of the provincial government. V
(Note: The cultivation fee is temporarily determined as the same cost of land
compensation.                                          ,
3. Principle for Compensation
(1) Avoid land requisition as far as possible. If it is impossible to avoid, land
16



requisition shall be as fewer as possible, then a Resettlement Action Plan and payment
for various compensation shall be made accordingly.
(2) Make sure the living standard, productive ability and income of the people
influenced can be resumed to the original level.
(3) Buildings such as residential houses to be removed must be compensated
according to replacement cost.
(4) In principle, the new houses for the migrants shall be ready before the demolition
of the old ones, and the removal expense shall be paid. If a transition period is
necessary, the units who undertaking the proposed project shall properly pay the
corresponding expenses.
(5) The units who undertaking the proposed project shall strictly follow the
compensation policy and standard drawn up in the Resettlement Action Plan. If there
are some important or major variations during the implementation period, a report
concerning this case shall be submitted to the World Bank before they come into force.
When it is necessary, revision shall be made to the Resettlement Action Plan.

3. Labor Resettlement
(1) Rearrangement of the village land
No city land shall be requisitioned for this project. The agricultural income for the
Migrants whose land is occupied is 80% of their annual revenue. The responsibility
filed for each labor force is 3mu in Zhuniadian Prefecture and 2mu in Xinyang city.
Since land rearrangement shall be made within each of the villages, no rearrangement
shall be made among the villages. Because there is no preserved land in the villages
affected by this project, the land have to be rearranged.
Since land requisition is not concentrated in one place, the labor forces can still obtain
sufficient cultivated land after land rearrangement. No surplus labor forces will come
up. The land compensation shall be arranged by the village committee to develop
collective production.
Along Zhumadian-Xinyang Expressway Project, the residential houses for 44
households in Xinyang will be demolished and relocated. The locations for new
houses, according to the request of the migrants, shall be all in the original villages.
The locations for new houses to be built shall be located in the wasted land in the
village, no secondary resettlement is required.

Note: The comprehensive residential standard for the villages affected is not less than
the average standard of the county. Most of the houses affected are brick wood
structures. Compensation to farmer is based on market resettlement price. Because
most of the farmers have fund deposits, the standard of new buildings shall be higher
than the original ones. According to the investigation, most of the migrants are willing
to built brick concrete houses.
