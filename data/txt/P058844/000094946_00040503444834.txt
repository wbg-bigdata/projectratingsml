General
The expressway from Zhumadian to Xinyang, as the southern extension of the
expressway from Zhengzhou to Xuchang, Luohe and Zhumadian that runs through the
south of Henan province, is the vital passage of the north to. south highway
transportation channel in China. It is an important part of Beijing-Zhuhai National
Trunk Highway (NTH). It starts from the terminal of Luohe-Zhumadian Expressway,
which is now under construction and ends in the east of Xinyang City where the
interchange overpasses the National Highway 312, with total length of 95 .52 km.
This section of expressway connects two important regions in south Henan-
Zhumadian Prefecture and Xinyang City. It passes through Runan, Queshan and
Pingqiao county/district, etc. They are all major agricultural areas in Henan Province..
According to statistics of 1997, the area of Zhumadian and Xinyang City/Prefecture is
33618Sq. Km, the total population is 15.49 million and GDP is 43.563 billion-yuan
RMB. It takes 10.67%/ of the GDP of Henan Province.
In 1998, the daily traffic volume came to 10,000 vehicle/day within this section of the
existing highways, which significantly exceeded the capacity of the existing highways.
Therefore, it is necessary to build an expressway from Zhumadian to Xinyang.
Construction of this section of expressway will occupy certain amount of land
(include cultivated land) permanently or temporarily. Some of the ground attachments
will be removed. Therefore, the normal, fife and production of the local people will be
influenced at certain leveL This Resettlement Action Plan is prepared to solve and
settle these problems properly, offer reasonable compensation and resettlement to the
people who are influenced by land requisition and removal, protect the migrants'
lawfil rights, and create conditions for future economic development to keep the
migrants' living standard at least the not lower than the form one.
This project shall occupy 9,074mu (604.93 ha.) of land permanently and remove
31317Sq.m of buildings. 1,384mu (92.27 ha.) of land shall be occupied temporarily.
The amount for compensation shall be 231.86846 million-yuan and 4,920 people shall
be affected.
The cultivated land to be affected is 252,812mu. The permanent land requisition for
this project is 3.5% of the total cultivated land of to be villages of land requisition.'* ->M;
Therefore, the influence to the villages is not strong.
This project is planned to startonNov.20, 2000 and complete inNov.30, 2003.-

I. Background of the Project
1. Description of the Project and Its Major Purpose
The expressway from Zhumadian to Xinyang is an important part of Beijing-Zhuhai
NTH. It connects the important regions in the south of Henan Province-Zhumadian
Prefecture and Xinyang City. It is an important passage on north to south highway
transportation of China. At present, fully enclosed and elevated expressways from
Anyang to Xinxiang, and from Zhengzhou to Xuchang and Luohe have been built up.
The expressway from Luohe to Zhumadian is now under construction. They are also
parts of BeiJing- Zhuhai NTH. The upgrading of Class I highway from Xinxiang to
Zhengzhou and the preparatory work for Xlnxiang-Zhengzhou expressway are also in
process.                                                                               .
Because of the rapid economic development of China since reformation and opening
to world, highway traffic volume is increased greatly. The investigated traffic volume
between Zhumadian and Xinyang has been more than 10,000 vehicle/day (converted
into medium-type vehicle), which significantly exceeded the capacity of the existing
highways. Therefore, it is necessary and urgently required to build Zhumadian-
Xinyang expressway. It has important significance to improve and realize Beijing-
Zhuhai NTH to be functioned as expressway, to clear cross interference, to enhance
the capability of highway, to reduce traffic accidents and to promote further
development of the national economy.
2. Regions Affected and Benefited by the Projec
The expressway from Zhuniadian to Xinyang directly influences Zhumadian
Prefecture and Xinyang City, including 12 counties or districts under their
administration: Qinyang, Runan, Queshan, Pingyu, Suiping, Shangcai, Xincai,
Zhengyang, Pingqiao, Luoshan, Xixian and Guangshan as well as Luohe City and
Hubei Province. It will influence indirectly 5 counties including Xinxian, Huangchuan,
Huaibin, Gushi and Shangcheng as well as Nanyang City, Zhoukou Prefecture and
Anhui Province. The construction of 95.52km long expressway shall bring vigorous
development for the above-mentioned areas, which are main grain, cotton and edible
oil producers in Henan Province. Also the investment enviromnent shall be improved
and the economical .development shall be promoted. It will make great role in poverty
fighting.
3. Social and Economical BaCkground of the Regions Affected by the Project
Zhumadian Prefecture is located in the south of Henan Province with total area of
15,083Sq.m, 753,000 ha. of which is cultivated land. Its total population is 7.89
million, in which 7.04 million are agriculural people and 850,000 nonagricutural
people. Its population density is 523 person per square meter. The average cultivated
land per capita is 1.6mu. The main scope for agriculture includes grain, cotton and
edible oil. Main industxy sections include non-metal development, building mateials,
2



medicine, textile, machinery, electricity and chemistry. Its main products include
cigarette, beverage, alcohol, textile products, machine-made paper, paper plate,
synthetic ammonia, plastic products and cement. Its GDP in 1997 was 22.509 billion-
yuan, average 2,806 yuan per capita, ranking the 15th in 17 cities and prefectures in
the province.
Xinyang City, which connects with Hubei Province, is located in the south end of
Henan Province. It has 18,915sq.m of land with 520,000ha. cultivated land. It has 7.6
million people including 6.6 million'agricultural people and 1 million non-agricultural
people. The population density is 402 per square meter. The average cultivated land
per capita is 1.2mu. The main scope for agriculture includes grain, cotton, red ramie
and tea. Main industry sections include machinery, electricity, medicine, building
materials, foodstuff feedstuff, textile and chemistry. There are 38 kinds of explored
valuable mine resources, including serpentine and pearlite whose storage ranks first in l.  ' f
China. Its GDP in 1997 was 22.054 billion-yuan, average 2,785 yuan per capita,
ranking the 16th in 17 cities and prefectures in the province.
Zhumadian Prefecture and Xinyang City are both under-developed regions in
economy of the province. The backward situation in economy needs to be improved.
4. Measures Taken to Minimum Migrants
A lot of work has been done to minimum the influence caused by land requisition at
the stage of feasibility study of the project. The alignment of this proposed
expressway is determined according to the result of aerial photography, the land and
the buildings to be influenced can be clearly distinguished in the photograph.
In order to minimum the influence to the local people caused by land requisition of
this project, Henan Provincial Communications Planning, Survey & Design Institute
discussed with the leaders of highway construction departments and local
governments along the route to work out the scheme of alignment. A 1:2000
topographic map is finally adopted, with the purpose to take the influence of removal
and resettlement into consideration, to determine the scheme of alignment. From the
stage of preliminary design, land requisition and resettlement has been the main
factors that decide the project design and alignment. Because a lot of work has been
done in survey and design stage, best efforts have been paid to minimum .the influence
of land requisition.
In order to minimum the quantity of land occupation and removal further adjustment
for horizontal alignment is made during final design period, to avoid the alignment
goes through those villages whose population'is large. Also, the longitudinal rdiei   _
is reasonably adjusted to shorten the height of fill and the depth of cut, and the;
interchanges are awranged properly. .   .
In addition, effort shall be made to minimum the influence caused by land requisition
3



and resettlement during construction period. The temporary land used shall be focus
on existing buildings and waste yards (e.g. township enterprises that have been
closed). Also, best effort shall be made to balance the earthwork during construction
period, borrow sources shall be arranged in the waste land or waste hills.
5. Economical and Technical Feasibility Study
The preparatory work for this project is arranged earlier because of the big scale and
the large investment of this project.

was completed by Henan Provincial Communicatio'ns Planning, Survey & Design
Institute. In 1995, "Pre-feasibility Study for Beijing-Zhuhai NTH in the Section
between Luohe and Xinyang"' was completed. In 1998, 'Pre-feasibility Study for
Beijing-Zhuhai NTH in the Section between Zhumadian and Xinyang" andr
'Teasibility Study for Zhumadian-Xinyang Expressway of Beijing-Zhuhai NTW'
were completed.
6. The Preliminary Design and Construction Design
The Preliminary Design for this project has been completed during the period of
October 1998 to January 1999, the Construction Design has been started in May, 1999
and shall be completed in October 1999 by Henan provincial Communications
Planning, Survey & Design Institute.

(2) The resettlement subsidy shown in the table is based on each mu (converted
from each person).
(3) Because of the average cultivated land scope for each labor in each village
affected is 2.09-5.96, it is easier to resettle and resume productive ability of the
people affected. Therefore, the compensation times is based on low limit of
"Provincial Execution Method of Land Management Law".
Information:
Initial consultation from Land Management Bureau of Zhuniadian Prefecture and
statistic organizations of Xinyang City.
Arranged by Henan Provincial Land Management Bureau and government of Pinqiao
District, Xinyang City, in first of June 1999, the compensation standard for land
requisition was preliminary estimated by Land Management Bureau of Zhumadian
Prefecture and Statistic Bureau of Pingqiao District, Xinyang City, and a report in
writing were furnished. The report shows that the average annual output value for
every mu of cultivated land is different form the calculdting result, but the difference
is slight.
In the "Budgetary Estimate Program for Compensation of Land Requistion" provided
by Land Management Bureau of Zhumadian Prefecture in June 15, 1999, the' -
compensation  rate  is  1,118yuan/muyear, while  the  calculating  result for
compensation rate is 1,O91yuan/mu.year,'the difference is only 2.4%. The anmnal
average output value per mu for the township/town along the proposed project in year
1998 is 1054.5yuan/mu.year (data provided by Statistic Bureau of Pingqiao District,
17



Xinyang City), while the calculation result is 961.5yuan/mu.year, the difference is
8.8%.

Note: We know that, after investigation, the compensation standard requested by the
county/township is based on brick-concrete structural storied building for the new
house including a certain amount for house finishing. After we calculated the
replacement cost for houses under Henan II H1 hway Project, we found out: in 1997,
the replacement cost for brick-concrete strucural single-story house was
240yuan/sq.m, while for brick-concrete structural brick-concrete structural storied.
building was 265yuan/sq.m. Also, inflation rate in Hean province in 1998 and 1999
was zero. Therefore, we adopt the compensation standard listed in table 3.3. Howwer,e
if there is any adjustment for houses' replacement cost during the implementation
period, a report shall be submitted to the World Bank.
Compensation for Young Crops
(1) Compensation for young, crops shall be based on Clause 34(3) in "Execution
Methods in Carrfing Out Land Management Law in Henan Province" (revised draft).
That is, compensation shall be based on output value for one harvest (output value for
one harvest: 546yuan/mu for Zhumadian Prefecture, 481yuanlmu for Xinyang City),
so the total compensation fee for the whole project shall be 4,153,172yuan RMB.
(2) Compensation for houses (including other buildings affected)
See Table 4.1 and Table 3.3.
(3) Compensation for vulnerable groups: I,O0Oyuan/househole.
(4) Compensation for infiasucture facilities: see Table 3.4.  e

shall be made among the villages. Because there is no preserved land in the villages
affected by this project, the land have to be rearranged.'

sufficient cultivated land after land rearrangement. No surplus labor forces will come
up. The land compensation shall be arranged by the village committee to develop"
