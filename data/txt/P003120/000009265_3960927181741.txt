MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO ZAIRE
FOR A SECOND GECAMINES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Zaire for SDR 15.4 million (US$20 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would help finance a
technical assistance project to the country's leading mining company and
foreign exchange earner, Gecamines. It would be on standard IDA terms to
the Government and onlent to Gecamines on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA.
2.        Background.  Following ten years of economic decline and ill-
guided economic policies, internal and external imbalances reached an all
time high in 1983. The Government, with IMF and IDA assistance, embarked
on a stabilization program aimed at correcting these imbalances and
establishing the preconditions for the resumption of growth. From 1983 to
1986, the authorities implemented the program, and though performance was
uneven, improvements were achieved in narrowing the disequilibria and
putting in place an economic climate more conducive to productive
activities. In October 1986, the Government indicated that it would not
continue following the program, arguing that net aid had been inadequate
with the result that, in spite of overall good policy performance, growth
in per capita income was negative. Agreement was reached, though, in
January, 1987 to restore the program, and in June 1987 a Structural
Adjustment Credit to expand and deepen the program was approved by the
Executive Directors. Implementation of the program has been poor until
very recently. The Government was unwilling to undertake sensitive policy
changes (including implementation of agreed-on policies on pricing of
petroleum products and of foreign exchange). In 1988, monetary financing
of the budget deficit was well above targeted levels, pushing inflation to
almost 100 percent per annum. Therefore, the release of the second tranche
of the SAL had to be postponed.
3.        A new Prime Minister was appointed in November 1988 and was
given a mandate to take the steps necessary to put the adjustment programs
supported by IDA and the IMF back on track. This was the same Prime
Minister who had been in office during 1983-86, the period of relatively
successful implementation of adjustment policies. Since November, the
Government has taken positive action on the issues under contention and the
Second Tranche of the SAL was released on May 19, 1989. The Government
seems well aware of the need to reestablish the credibility of its
adjustment program to benefit from substantial external resources available
under recent donor/creditor initiatives, including the Special Program for
Assistance for Sub-Saharan Africa.
4.        Complementary to the adjustment program, IDA has been aiding
Zaire in a number of other key areas. Mining, especially the operations of
Gecamines, is such a key area. C :amines accounts for about 55Z of Zaire's



- 2 -
exports and contributes about 25S of the Government's tax revenue. It
typically produces in a year around 470,000 tonnes of copper, 12,000 tonnes
of cobalt, 65,000 tonnes of zinc and small mounts of cadmium and other
metals. It employs about 33,000 people, almost all of whom are in the
Shaba province where its mines and metallurglcal facilities are located,
and where the company is headquartered. In addition, CGcam2nes manages a
copper producing affiliate, Sodimiza, which produces about 35,000 tonnes of
copper per year. In 1986 Gecamines launched a major rehabilitation program
to modernize its facilities and bring down costs. This program, supported
by several donors (including a World Bank Loan - 2682-ZR), is lagging
behind schedule primarily due to delays in the procurement process. This
is reducing Gecamines effectiveness and contributing to a substantial
increase in the company's costs. Other factors, such as the increase in
the value of European currencies relative to the dollar, depletion of mined
ore stockpiles, excessive fees paid to agents, and lack of systematic and
efficient purchasing systems have also contributed to a sharp rise in the
company's cost of production over the last three years. Finally, during
the same peried, several other major copper producers have lowered their
costs of production, in part through the use of improved technology. As a
result, Gecamines has gone from being one of the world's lower cost copper
producers in 1986 (ranking in the lower quartile of the world cost curve)
to being a higher cost producer with costs in the upper third of the
industry's cost curve by late 1988. At the same time, production and
transport problems have been affecting the company's output and sales.
While high copper prices in 1988 and early 1989 allow Gdcamines to remain
profitable in the short run, the company's long-term prospects are
seriously damaged by its high cost level.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are
to assist Gdcamines in reducing costs, improving operating efficiency,
accelerating the current rehabilitation program, and preparing the next
stage of the rehabilitation program. The project would help G4camines to
achieve these objectives bys (a) lowering costs through improved
maintenance management and purchasing systems; (b) strengthening Gdcamines
management and its administrative capacityg and (c) helping to prepare a
five year investment program aimed at increasing productivity. An earlier
IDA Technical Assistance Credit (1336-ZR) extended to G6camines in 1983,
has contributed substantially to improving G6camines performance,
especially in the accounting and finance areas. However, the Credit closed
in September 1987. The proposed credit would continue and extend the work
begun under the previous Credit as well as begin work in the purchasing,
materials management, personnel, strategic planning and environmental
areas.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Given Gecamines' importance in
the Zairian economy, maintaining close contact with the company is an
integral part of our country strategy. Hence, the Bank group has, thu3
far, played a leading role among Zaire's donors in monitoring and in
providing assistance to G6camines. The main purposes of this assistance
were to increase the company's efficiency both in terms of production and
foreign exchange use, and to increase transparency in the company's
financial operations and relations with the state. The first IBBD Loan to



- 3 -
G4camines (1090-ZR) was extended in 1975 and is now largely repaid. The
1983 Technical Assistence Credit helped to improve the company's operations
and to prepare the 1986-1990 Rehabilitation Program, which was financed in
part by an IBRD Loan (2682-ZR) in 1986 with cofinancing from the EIB, AfDB,
CCCE and EEC. That Loan is now largely committed. The proposed operation
would continue to focus on improving financial management and technical
efficiency, and would assist the company in improving procurement,
materials management, maintenance and personnel systems and in preparing a
new investment program including an environmental action plan. IDA's
involvement would reinforce Gecamines management's resolve to obtain the
needed level of technical assistance and strengthen Government support for
this step. Furthermore, our increased presence in strategic areas (linked,
inter alia, to G6camines' efficient use of foreign exchange and long-term
prospecta) should help contribute to fiscal discipline.
7.        Project Description.  The six major components of the project
would cover:
(1)  restructuring and improving Gecamines' purchasing and materials
management operations including procurement, logistics, storage
and inventory management. This would involve a major study of
this area followed by the implementation of the recommendations
of this study including probably the introduction of new
management information systems,
(2) improving maintenance management and operations by enhancing
preventive maintenance, repair and rehabilitation functions,
providing additional training to the maintenance workers and
rationalizing G4camines' spare parts manufacturing operations;
(3) assisting Gecamines' personnel department in improving personnel
management, especially in the area of manpower planning and
personnel evaluation systems, and assisting the training
department in improving training planning;
(4) continuing assistance to the finance department in Gecamines in
improving the financial operations of the company and expanding
the use of cost accounting systems to most major operating
units;
(5) strengthening the information technology group in Gecamines in
order to handle the increased demand for information technology
support created by the four above components; and
(6) carrying out strategic studies, including developing an
environmental action plan, to assist the company in formulating
its long range investment plan.
The project, to be carried out over five years, provides funds for
technical assistance from consulting firms as well as individual experts.
The total cost of the preject is estimated at US$30 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$25 million. A break down of the costs and the



- 4 -
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown In Schedule S.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Zaire are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map to
also attached as is a Technical Annex.
8.        Asreed Actions.  Major agreements reached during negotiations
include:
(1) a prelimina y corporate plan for Gecamines covering tue period
through the year 2000 will be prepared by December 31, 1989;
(2) an environmental action plan for 06camines will be completed by
July 1, 1990s
(3) a study will be carried out in a phased manner comparing the
actual costs of routine purchases made by Gdcamines directly and
through intermediaries with suppliers prices and prices on
international markets to be completed no later than March 30,
1990. G6camines will then prepare, In cousultation with IDA, a
plan of action to achieve more cost-effective procurement to be
implemented beginning no later thn September 30, 1990. In the
interim, G6camines will take prompt action, Ir consultation with
IDA, to resolve any procurement problems that are identified;
(4)  the rehabilitation project implementation group at Gdcamines
will be reinforced by filling the 11 top level vacancies which
currently exist by December 31, 1989s
(5) the Strategic Planning Unit at G6camines should be fully staffed
by March 30, 1990;
(6) the Government will provide the Association with audited 1989
financial statements for Sodimiza by July 1, 1990;
(7) the Government and G6camines will implement the dividend policy
for GOcamines by September 30, 1989; and
(8) the Government and the Bank of Zaire will consult with IDA prior
to any sales of foteign exchange by Gecamines to the Bank of
Zaire above the latter institution's 552 quota unless these
additional foreign exchange sales are required by Gc&Aines to
obtain Zaires to meet taxes or dividend payments.
9.        Benefits.  The proposed project would have several major
benefits for the company and country. First, it is designed to assist Sn
reducing the company's costs by improving operating efficiency and reducing
the costs of purchases. This would increase the balance of payments and
fiscal benefits that Zaire derives from the company and would help
Gecamlnes remain competitive in the world copper industry, a necessary
condition for the healthy survival of the company. Second, the project
would assist G4camines in preparing a strategic plan designed to assure its



competitiveness in the long run. Third, the project vould lead to the
development of an environmental action plan designed to reduce the
company's emission of effluents and its impact on the environment of the
Shaba province.
10.       Risks.  The proposed technical assistance project itself
involves few major risks. However, Gecamines faces three major risks.
First is the possibility of a sharp decline in copper prices to 1986 levels
(62c/lb) at which levels the company would currently have difficulty
surviving. The prorosed technical assistance project is mainly aimed at
reducing this risk by reducing production costs. The second major risk is
the possibility of confiscatory tax andlor foreign exchange retention
policies imposed by the Government. Close monitoring of the financial
situation at Gecamines and an active country dialogue should reduce this
risk. The third major risk is a breakdown in the various transportation
systems on which the company relies for moving intermediate products among
its plants and mines and fot importing supplies and exporting copper and
cobalt. This risk is being reduced by the Association's current assistance
to the Zairian state railroad company (SNCZ). Furthermore, in all cases
the company would benefit from having skilled technical experts, hired
under this project, to assist it in addressing these problems.
11.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed ^redit.

SECOND GECAMINES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Institutional Framework for Proiect
1.        Gecamines Exploitation (G0camines) is the dominant company in
the Gdcamines group of companies accounting for over 95Z of the value added
by the group. The other members of the group are ¢dcamines Holding,
G6camines Commerciale and Gecamines D6veloppement. G4camines Holding is
the "holding' company for the group with an oversight role for the other
three companies. The President of G4camines Holding reports to a Board of
Directors composed of the Ministers of Finance, Mines, Planning, Portfolio
and the Governor of the Bank of Zaire. Gicamines Commerciale is
responsible for all metal sales by the group while G6camines D6veloppement
raises some agricultural products and purchases others for supply to
G6camines Exploitation.
2.        The President of Gecamines Exploitation is appointed by the Head
of State and reports to a Board of Directors (Conseil d'administration).
The Board meets six times a year and decides overall policy issues. It is
composed of the four highest ranking officials of G4camines Exploitation,
the President of Gecamines Holding, representatives of the Ministry of
Portfolio and the Office of the President, two officials from Shaba
province and a representative of the union. Day to day operations of the
company are carried out by the President of G6camines assisted by a five
person management committee composed of the four highest ranking officers
of the company (including the President) and a representative of the union.
3.        Given the importance of Gcamines Exploitation to the country,
the formal management mechanism described above is supplemented by an
informal mechanism. On most major policy issues involving the company, the
President has direct access to the Head of State.
4.        The tax regime governing G6camines (Gecamines Exploitation) is
rather complex. There are five basic types of taxes of which four are
indirect and one direct.  The most important tax is an export duty of 7? on
metal exports. This duty is supplemented by an additional duty on copper
exports when the price of copper exceeds 2,500 SDR per metric tone.  The
second most important tax consists of the tariffs on Gecamines imports.
These in total are almost as large as the export duty. The two other
indirect taxes are a revenue tax (contribution sur le chiffre d'affaires)
and payroll taxes on Zairian and expatriate workers. In addition, the
company is subject to direct corporate tax at a 50? rate. Howevr, the



- 13 -                    ANNEX
Page 2 of 7
export duty is treated as a credit for corporate income tax purposes.
Together, these various taxes create a relatively large tax burden for
Gecamines especially when copper prices are high. Under Loan 2682-ZR the
Government is required to consult with the Bank prior to changing th. tax
regime of Gecamines. In fact, there have been few changes in the tax
regime since approval by the Bank of Loan 2682-ZR, but the Bank has been
consulted on those changes which have occurred.
5.        In contrast with the tax laws, the foreign exchange regime
governing Gecamines is relatively straight forward.  The company, under the
terms of various loan covenants, is entitled to retain in foreign exchange
45? of its export receipts. The other 552 of its export receipts are sold
to the Bank of Zaire with Gecamines receiving zaires in return. Recently,
Gecamines has been selling to the Bank of Zaire additional foreign exchange
out of its 451 allocation. This has created a tight foreign exchange
situation for the company and an excess of liquidity in zaires. Gecamines
now has substantial zaire holdings which are declining in value as the
currency depreciates and interest rates in the country have been below the
inflation and devaluation rates. In 1988 the company's losses due to the
declinep J the value of its zaire holdings were US$62 million.
6.        Gecamines is expected to pay dividends depending on its
profitability and need for cash. The company had a consultant prepare a
dividend policy which would require the company to pay out excess cash
flow, after taking into account its need for cash, especially for
investments, and its capacity to borrow. This policy was submitted to the
Government for approval. The Government has accepted it in principle but
has not yet agreed to the implementing rules without which the policy
remains vague. Under Section 3.06 of the Guarantee Agreement for Loan
2682-ZR, the Government is required to implement the dividend policy. A
condition of this technical assistance project is that the policy be
implemented by September 30, 1989.
Company's Position
7.        Gecamines production complex is an int_cate matrix of
operations spread over 300 km in the Zairian copperbelt, and grouped into
three separate operating divisions: west (Kolwezi), center (Likasi) and
south (Lubumbashi). About 80? of the company's copper ore is mined in the
western division, largely in open pit mines, the most important of which is
KOV. Relatively small amounts of copper ore are mined in the central and
southern divisions.   The copper ore undergoes concentration (to increase
the metal content) in the division where it is produced. However,
smelters, hydrometallurgical plants and refineries are scattered among the
different divisions with the greatest concentration of such plants in the
central division. Therefore, there is a large scale movement of
intermediate copper products between the divisions, especially concentrate
moving from the western division to the central division for further
treatment. Cobalt ore is mined with the copper ore and is extracted in
hydrometallurgical plants in both the western and central divisions,
usually in combination with copper. Zinc is produced in the southern



- 14-                     ANNEX
Page 3 of 7
division, smelted in the central division and refined In the western
division.
8.        Gdcamines copper is exported by train and river boat through
Zaire to the port of Matadi, by train through Zambia and Zimbabwe to South
African ports and in small quantities by truck to the port of Dar-es-Salaam
in Tanzania. Zinc is exported by the same routes as copper while all
cobalt exports normally go through South African ports. All of these
routes have limited capacity to carry metals and unfortunately, their
reliability is generally deteriorating. The Association is assisting with
stabilizing and rehabilitating the Zairian State Railway Company (SNCZ),
but the most rapid deterioration recently has been in Zambia, where IDA
disbursements are suspended.
9.        Gicamines operations are unusual in that though the average ore
grade is the highest in the world (over 4Z copper), mining conditions are
difficult (high stripping ratios, etc.) and the metallurgy of the ores is
complex (mixtures of oxides and sulphides of copper and cobalt). The
complex mining, transport and metallurgical recovery conditions drive up
costs while the high ore grades and the considerable value of the cobalt by
product, tend to reduce the costs of producing the copper. In the early
1980's, due to a combination of high ore grades and the high value of
cobalt, Gecamines was one of the world's lowest cost copper producers.
Over the decade of the 1980's, the company's competitive position has
deteriorated as other copper producers have cut costs and introduced the
new solvent extraction (leaching) technology while Gdcamines incurred
increased costs, in part due to a lack of equipment replacement, and a
decline in cobalt prices. This deterioration in the company's competitive
position has been especially acute during the period 1986-89. Currently,
Gdcamines is a high cost copper producer with cash costs in the upper third
of all copper producing companies.
10.       Historically, G6camines has produced around 470,000 tonnes of
copper per year. In 1988, however, copper production declined to 438,000
tonnes from 474,000 tonnes in 1987. This decline in production was due to
three factors: (a) the deterioration in the transport infrastructure which
impeded the movement of concentrates from the main mining area (Kolwexi) to
the metallurgical plants at Lubumbashi and Likasi; (b) delays in the
rehabilitation program and (c) problems with specific operating units such
as the Ripushi concentrator and Lubumbashi smelter. It is expected that
production will increase modestly In 1989 due to: (a) the arrival of new
equipment as part of the rehabilitation project for Gdcamines mines and
plants; and (b) an anticipated improvement in the performance of SNCZ with
the leasing of an increased number of locomotives and the increased
availability of spares supplied under IDA's First Transport Rehabilitation
Project. In the longer run, however, for Gdcamines to maintain production
of 470,000 tonnes per year, the company will have to complete the
rehabilitation program thereby increasing efficiency and lowering costs,
take other cost cutting steps (procurement and maintenance are key areas
for savings) and have access to adequate transportation facilities.



-15-                      ANNEX
Page 4 of 7
11.       Because of the very high levels of copper prices which have
existed since late 1987 and the slow start of the rehabilitation project,
Gecamines has had a strong cash flow position, and has been able to provide
much more foreign exchange than normal to the Bank of Zaire. High copper
prices have also allowed it to pay more taxes. These payments, however,
have left the company in a tight financial position in terms of foreign
exchange liquidity. At the end of 1988, the company 'ad managed to
increase its short term foreign exchange liquidity substantially, but this
was almost entirely done through short term overseas borrowing. The
company was able to save very little of the foreign exchange it generated.
On the other hand, the situation in Zaires is quite different with the
company having accumulated close to US$100 million worth of Zaires in 1988.
12.       The company's balance sheet is healthy with limited long term
debt and a low debt to equity ratio. The current ratio is also acceptable
on an overall basis. Again, the main potential problem with the balance
sheet is the currency mix of the assets and liabilities. Most of the
assets are in Zaires while a substantial part of the liabilities are in
foreign currencies. This mix is not an actual problem as long as the
company is profitable and is allowed to keep a substantial part of its
foreign exchange revenue.
13.       When copper prices decline significantly, the company will not
be able to maintain its current level of foreign exchange sales or tax
payments. In addition, the acceleration in the rehabilitation program will
also prevent the current level of foreign exchange sales. Any effort by
the Government to force Gecamines to maintain tax or foreign exchange
payments in these circumstances could be severely damaging to the company.
To prevent this occurrence, the proposed project would complement existing
covenants under IBRD Loan 2682-ZR in the areas of foreign exchange sales
and dividend payments.
Prolect Components
14.       The first component of the project is a thorough overhaul of
Gecamines purchasing and materials management operations. Costs of
purchases appear excessive and there are too many of some spares and
serious shortages of others. There are also instances of preferential
purchasing arrangements which contribute to driving up costs. In the
initial stage, Gecamines would retain a consulting firm, acceptable to IDA,
to do a thorough study of this entire area with the study financed direztly
by Gecamines and including a comparative survey of prices obtained through
the different procurement channels currently used by Gecamines. The role
of IDA would be to review and assist with the implementation of the
recommendations of the study assuming they are acceptable to IDA. A key
element of this component would be the installation of a new purchasing and
inventory tracking system. The batch system currently in use at Gecamines
was set up in 1971 and is now outdated. A second issue would be to review
the large number of items ordered and stored by Gecamines (over 300,000),
and to ascertain whether standardization on certain types of equipment
could reduce the inventory and purchasing problems. The study would also
look at the interfaces between purchasing, materials management and



- 16 -
MNEX
Page 5 of 7
maintenance. Implementation of the recommendations of the study is
expected to involve at least 10-15 expatriates working at G4ccamnes for
about three years setting up new systems and training Zairian staff to
replace them.
15.       The second component would aim at improving G6camines
maintenance operations. A study of these operations and their problems is
currently being carried out by G4camines. This study would be used as the
basis for hiring a firm specialized in maintenance operations to do a
review of the G6camines operations and G6camines' analysis of the problem.
This firm would be hired from a short list acceptable to IDA. It is likely
that the review would indicate that Gdcamines should concentrate more on
preventive maintenance, that the organization of the maintenance operations
needs to be improved and that the maintenance workers need additional
training. In addition, the use of maintenance contractors and/or dealers
needs to be looked at while the parts manufacturing facility at Likasi
needs to be rationalized and given a clearer mission. Implementation of
the recommendations of the review would require at least 15 or more
expatriates for three years including some training personnel.
16.       The technical assistance for the personnel and training
department would consist of at least four sub-components. Three of the
sub-components would involve continuing the assistance to the personnel
department begun under the Gdcamines Rehabilitation Project (2682-ZR).
Under the latter project, technical assistance was provided to assist the
company in setting up a job classification system and establishing a
general salary policy. The current project would continue this work by
providing technical assistance to establish an improved evaluation system
for employees and enhanced systems of manpower planning. The other sub-
component would involve assistance to the training department to improve
its training planning.
17.       Under the previous technical assistance project to Gecamines,
Credit 1336-ZR (now closed), IDA provided assistance to the company in
improving ita financial and accounting functions and introducing a cost
accounting system. As a result the quality and timeliness of Gecamines
financial reporting has improved sharply both for internal and external
use. The current project would continue this technical assistance thereby
allowing further improvements in financial controls and reporting and the
introduction of the cost accounting systzem at most major operating units.
18.       Under the previous Technical Assistance Project, IDA also
assisted the company in developing its information technology capability.
The current project would continue and expand this assistance since all of
the above components of this project would require information technology
specialists to assist in their implementation and Gecamines does not have
sufficient information technology specialists nor highly skilled
specialists in some of the areas discussed above.
19.       Finall', the project would provide funds to carry out various
strategic studies to assist Gecamines in its long term planning. Selection
of a consultant for one of these studies, strategies for Gecamines

increasing zinc production, is underway with the study likely to be
financed directly by Gecamines. The first IDA financed study would be an
action plan to reduce Gecamines emissions of effluents. The company now
makes a significant effort to reduce pollutants but as part of its long
range planning it needs to study what further steps it should take over the
next five to ten years and what these will cost. In addition, the company
would need assistance in doing studies of other strategic issues related to
its long range plans.
B. PROJECT FINANCING, ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
20.       The total costs of the proposed project would be about US$30
million including US$2 million of contingencies. The foreign exchange cost
of the project would be US$25 million of which IDA would provide US$20
million and Gdcamines US$5 million. The estimated local costs of the
project are around US$5 million including housing, office space, transport,
secretarial support, and communications. All local costs would be borne by
G6camines. In addition, G6camines would be responsible for any cost
overrun above the US$2 million in contingencies.
21.       The project would be implemented by G6camines.  An overall
project coordinator would be appointed, but on a day to day basis each of
the components above would be administered by the department concerned.
22.       Contracting of technical assistance would follow Bank/IDA
guidelines. There would be basically two types of technical assistance, by
firms and by individuals. For technical assistance from consulting firms,
IDA would review the terms of reference, the short list used, the selection
process and the final contract. It is likely that a significant part of
the work on purchasing, maintenance, personnel, training and strategic
studies would be done by such consulting firms. However, the
implementation of the recommendatlons by the consulting firms would be
carried out to a significant degree by individual consultants. In
addition, the experts hired for the finance, accounting and information
technologies areas would be almost entirely individual consultants. For
these consultants the Bank would review job descriptions, compensation,
contract terms and the resumes of the individuals to be appointed to the
most important positions. For the finance and accounting functions,
relatively little review would be required since it is anticipated that
individuals hired under the previous technical assistance project would
remain in place.
23.       The proposed project would be implemented over four years.  An
implementation schedule for the various components of the project is given
as Schedule 1. It shows for each component the planned implementation time
table. The shortest implementation period would be for the finance and
accounting components since most of the individuals to be hired are already
at work. The maintenance and purchasing components would take longest,
especially, maintenance, because of the complexity of these issues and the
limited number of consulting firms with specialized experience in these
areas.

Page 7 of 7
24.       A Special Account (SA) would be set up for this project and
would be operated according to standard IDA procedures. The A would be
audited by outside auditors, acceptable to IDA, with the results of the
audit available to IDA within six months after the end of the fiscal year.
Gecamines would continue to have its accounts audited by an acceptable
outside auditor with the results also available six months after the end of
the fiscal year. Gdcamines would prepare a yearly report on the status of
the technical assistance project and at the end of the project would
