General
While the Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project (JIAMP) does not involve
construction of new dams or reservoir, the project's Irrigation Component includes 96 existing
irrigation areas in 21 project counties, of which 68 in 19 project counties depend on reservoir
supplies for irrigation.. The 68 irrigation areas are mainly located in the eastern, northern and
southern parts of Jiangxi Province, and there are altogether 124 dams. Of these 76 dams are 10
meters and above in height and with storage volume of one million cubic meters and above, thus
being subject to safety review in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank and in
accordance with OP 4.37. The remaining 48 are subject to regular inspection with special
reference to dam safety.
The project will be implemented in accordance with the Dam Safety Review Management Plans,
consistent with World Bank Operational Policy for Dam Safety, and acceptable to the Chinese
national regulations relating to dam safety. These plans include (1) Dam Safety Review
Guidelines (including two tables listing all dams in project areas with technical specifications
related to these dams); (2) Guidelines for Small Dam Safety Review guidelines; (3) Guidelines
Dam Safety Emergency Preparedness; and (4) Guidelines for Operation and Maintenance of
Project Dams. A brief summary of each of these documents is provided below.
Document 1. Dam Safety Review Guidelines
This document is formulated according to national regulations and review methods issued by
China State Council and the Ministry of Water Conservation, and the World Bank Operational
Policy OP 4.37 on Dam Safety. It covers the application of the different guidelines. For instance,
WB guidelines apply to all reservoir dams in the irrigation zones of the project, if their height is
more than 15 mneters, or if their height is between 10 and 15 meters, but have a reservoir capacity
that is larger than 1 million cubic meters. National guidelines apply to all dams in project areas
that have not passed safety tests in the past 6 to 10 years. It lays out the procedure to carry out
periodic dam safety reviews, the necessary expertise for the team undertaking it, classification
criteria for different dams, and the responsibility of the provincialUregional administrative
departments in initiating the reviews.
Document 2. Guidelinesfor Small Dam Safety Review
This document covers the applicability of the guidelines, the necessary steps to organize a small
dam review and the basic procedure to follow during a review. It elaborates on staffing needs,
expertise and material required, responsibilities of eater resource bureaus and field inspection
procedures. Additional technical forms that could be of used as reference during review and
inspection, are included. (e.g composition of dam engineering hazard value, composition of
spillway engineering hazard value, etc.).
Document 3. Guidelinesfor Dam Safety Emergency Preparedntess
This document starts by providing an overview of the basic conditions, and a brief description of
the potentially affected areas with a review of water resources characteristics and rainfall patterns.
The primary risk identified is flood with the threat to downstream life, property, and economic
activity. An outline for the preparation of a risk map is laid out, and a flood control scheme is
presented. The latter suggests some additional works such as improving capability of rainstorm
and flood forecasting, flood-control inspection, strengthening the management of engineering
structures such as reservoirs, river training activities, dikes, and improving flood control
equipments.

included for review based on safety considerations;
1-2 Dams which have not been subject to a safety review and have not been given a safety
clearance during the past 6-10 years;
1-3 Dams which were subject to a safety review during the past 6-10 years and rated as 'third
category damsi", and which have not been strengthened and have not been given a safety
clearance;
1-4 68 existing dams identified as poptential dams serving irrigation sub-projects would be
subject to these guidelines. These are shown in Annex 8-1-2. The list is not exhaustive, and
additional potential dams may be included as and when they are identified.
1-5 Dams 10 m and above but below 15 m in height and with storage capacity of one million
cubic metes and above would be subject to the Small Dam Safety Review Guidelines as per Annex
8-2.
2. Irrigation sub-projects served by existing dams can be included for implementation in the
annual work plan only if such dams have been subject to the safety review procedures and rated as
'first category dams' or 'second category dams'.
3. Organization of Safety Review
3-1 A dam safety review would be organized and presided over by the authority responsible for its
admunstration. The authority concerned would appoint relevant specialists to form an expert panel
for the safety review.of the dam.
3-2 An expert panel generally comprises 7-9 specialists, and should include: (i) the technical
person in charge from the authority responsible for the administration of the dam; (2) the technical

Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project
Irrigation Component
Small Dams Safety Review Guidelines
1. Dams Subject to Review
1.1 These guidelines are applicable to those dams in the project area as defined in 1.2 below.
The guidelines do not conflict with dam safety review requirements prescribed by the Ministry
of Water Resources of China;
1.2 Dams which are 10 meters and above but are below 15 meters in height and with storage
capacity of one million cubic meters and above are defined as small dams subject to these
guidelines;
1.3 Dams as defined in 1.2 above which have not been subject to a safety review and have not
been given a safety clearance during the past 6-10 years shall be subject to safety review;
1.4 Dams as defined in 1.2 above which were subject to a safety review during the past 6-10 years
and rated as 'third categoiy dams" and which have not been strengthened and have not been
given a safety clearance shall be subject to safety review;
1.5  Eight dams identified as potential dams serving irrigation sub-projects would be subject to
these guidelines, as shown in Appendix 2. The list is not exhaustive, and additional potential
small dams may be included as and when they are identified.
1 6 Irrigation sub-projects served by existing dams can be included for implementation in the annual
work plan only if such dams have been subject to the safety review procedures and rated as 'first
category dams' or 'second category darns'.
2. Organization of Safety Review
2.1 A dam safety review would be organized and presided over by the county Water Conservancy
Bureau (WCB) concerned. The WCB would appoint an expert panel for the safety review.of the
dam.
See Appendix I Classification Criteria for Dam Safety



2.2 An expert panel would generally comprise 7-9 specialists and should include:
(i)  the technical person in charge from the authority responsible for the administration of the
dam;
(ii) the technical person in charge and relevant technical specialists from the organization
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the dam;
(iii) relevant specialists from the organizations responsible for the design and construction of
the dam;
(iv) relevant specialists from a research institute or institution of higher learning;
(v) relevant specialists from the dam safety authority.
2.3 The expert panel should include specialists in the fields of hydrology, geology, hydraulic
structures, mechanical and electncal engineering, and metalwork.
3. Review Procedure
3.1 Every dam shall be separately reviewed;
3.2 The basic procedure would be in accordance with the method of safety ranking, principally to
understand the current status of a dam in respect of its relative safety so as to determine the extent of
hazardousness.
3.3 Data collection
The county WCB concerned would provide the following information and data:
(a) Relevant engineering design reports/general engineering information and data (e.g.,
location, catchment area, dam height, total reservoir storage capacity, downstream
population and irrgated area, etc.);
(b) Materials of the original dam design, geological investigations, engineering survey;
The organization/unit responsible for the operation and maintenance of the dam would provide the
following information and data:
(a) Construction records (including records of dam strengthening) and drawings (as-built
drawings included);
(b) Materials relating to operation and maintenance of the dam and reservoir, including
changes which occurred during operation (observational data included), hazardous and
abnormal situations that have taken place, water levels and flood discharges (including
maximum water level and year of occurrence).
2



3.4 Supplemental Data Collection. The panel of experts should review the adequacy and quality
of the materials, information and data collected. In the event that these are not sufficient for the
purpose of assessing the stability and safety of the dam, they should prescribe the requisite
hydrological, geotechnical and engineering survey data to be collected for study and analysis.
Supplemental data required should be provided by the county WCB concerned.
3.5 Field inspection. The panel of experts would carry out field inspection. The areas to be
inspected are:
(a) Dam: year of construction; structure quality; seepage condition and trend; dam stability
during operation;
(b) Spillway: year of construction; structure quality; structural stability;
(c) Outlet works: structure quality; operational conditions; structural stability;
(d) Metal works. period in service; operational conditions of lifting mechanism; conditions of
gates;
(e) Dam monitoring facilities: operational conditions.
3.6 Safety evaluation and determination
(a)  Scoring of safety ranking would be carried out during field inspection. Following field
inspection and interviews, reconnaissance, notes and video records, review of information
land data, members of the panel would evaluate and fill out the hazardous score sheet and
provide their evaluation of the safety of the dam accordingly;
(b) The score would be computed according to the following formula:
g
SR=E (SR),
1=1
where (SR), is the value scored for the i-th hazardous factor. Each hazardous factor is graded at
three levels of hazardousness: low, medium and high. Each level is assigned numerical values
starting from low to high. The extent of hazardousness of a dam is made up of several hazardous
factors as shown in the following tables:

(c)  Safety evaluation.  The SR scores by individual panel members would be computed.
The average of these scores would be the basis used for evaluating and determining the
safety of the dam. An average SR score of 42 and above indicates the dam is highly
hazardous.
(d)  Review findings. Using the SR score as the basis, the panel of experts would take into
account other factors not included in the above assessment and make an overall evaluation
and findings of the safety of the dam, determine its category, and prepare a dam safety
review report, to be reviewed and kept by the higher level authority responsible for the
administration of the dam. Where a dam is rated as a third category dam it is necessary
that the maximum storage volume and maximum water level allowable prior to
strengthening and rectification works being carried out be specified. Among other things,
the safety review report should include recommendations of specific actions to be taken on
(l) dam strengthening/remedial works; (ii) improved operation and maintenance
organization and procedures, including instrumentation for monitoring behavior and
performance of the dam; and (iii) emergency preparedness plan.
4. The project would finance the costs for dam safety review, subject to comformity with project
procurement procedures.
5.. Where it is necessary to carry out dam strengthening and rectification work following a dam
safety review, the works should be funded by the county government in which the dam is located.
The county government concerned would use funds for this purpose from the same sources as in the
case of dams subject to the Dams Satety Review Guidelines.

Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project
Irrigation Component
Guidelines for Emergency Preparedness Plan
Background
1.  Irrigation rehabilitation and improvement under the Irrigation Component of the Jiangxi
Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project (JLAMP) includes 96 existing irrigation areas in 21
project counties, of which 68 in 19 project counties depend on reservoir supplies for irrigation. The
safety or otherwise of the dams serving these areas will directly affect the safety of human lives and
property downstream of these structures. It is therefore very essential that, in addition to dam
safety review, an emergency preparedness plan is prepared for each dam.
2. Dams in the Proiect Area. The 68 irrigation areas are mainly located in the eastern, northern
and southern parts of Jiangxi Province, and there are altogether 124 dams. Of these 76 dams are 10
meters and above in height and with storage volume of one million cubic meters and above, and are
subject to safety review. The remaining 48 are subject to regular inspection with special reference
to dam safety. Dams are key points for flood control in irrigation areas.
3.  Rainfall and Flood Characteristics. The topography of Jiangxi comprises principally
mountainous and hilly regions, which account for 78% of its total land area. The project area is
largely situated in Poyang Lake region, where the occurrence of rainfall is influenced by monsoon
with moistures coming mainly from the South Sea of West Pacific Ocean, followed by the East Sea
and the Bay of Bengal of Indian Ocean., Influenced by the topography, the spatial distribution of
rainfall varies quite considerably, with a range of 1,400 - 1,900 mm in annual amount. The overall
distnbution pattern is as follows: rainfall is higher in surrounding mountainous areas than the central
basin and higher in the eastern part than the western part of the province. There is little difference
in temporal distribution within the year, with about 50% of the rainfall occurring during the flood
season from April through June. The remaining 50% are derived in other months, September
through February being the dry season.
4.  There are three types of rainstorms: frontal and cyclonic rain, thunderstorm and typhoon. In a
thunderstorm rainfall occurs with high intensity over small areas to form torrents in mountain
streams, which usually turn into devastating floods in small river valleys. Flood disasters are
mainly caused by frontal and cyclonic rains, characterized by long duration storms over large areas,
the rainfall duration can be as long as half a month.
5.  There are four high rainfall regions in the province: Huai'yu Mountain region, Wuyi Mountain
region, Jiuling Mountain region and Luoxiao Mountain region.



Preparation of Flood Risk Maps
6.  Flood maps showing the probable extent of area subject to flood disaster based on the present
flood protection standard, actual capacity of flood protection, and records of flooding. Flood risk
analysis should also be carried out.
7.  A flood risk map is prepared using composite information on geography, social and economic
conditions and flood characteristics, and through research into the information collected, flood
computations and processing and compilation of the results obtained. It is a visual presentation of
the probable extent and depth of inundation for a certain area due to flood, whereby it is possible to
know in advance and analyze and with this as a basis it is possible to analyze and predict the
probable risks and dangers resulting from floods of different magnitudes. Using flood frequency
analysis and information obtained from investigations into historical flood events, the flood
frequency-flood water level profiles are estimated. The extent of area that will be inundated is then
drawn on a map with the corresponding flood frequency and depths of flooding at significant places
shown.
8.  Two situations should be considered when preparing a flood risk map. One situation is that
the dam does not meet the flood control standard and has serious deficiency problems, which affect
the dam safety and may cause a dam failure. In such a situation, the flood risk map should be
prepared based on a dam break analysis due to the occurrence of the design flood. The other
situation is that the dam meets the flood control standard and existing deficiency problems would
not significantly affect the dam safety. For this situation, the flood risk map should be prepared
based on a dam break analysis due to the occurrence of the checking flood. For either situation, the
downstream flood inflow into the affected area with the same frequency of occurrence as the inflow
into the reservoir should be taken into account when drawing the extent of flooding and showing the
flood depths on the flood risk map.
Operational Strategies for Safety of Dam and Downstream Lives and Property
9.  Identification of key protection targets. Survey and investigation of the basic conditions on
both banks of the rivers downstream of the dam should be carried out. Key points for flood project
should be determined by identifying areas which are susceptible to flood threats. Flood water level
profiles at these points should be estimated.
10. Operational strategv to deal with floods equal or less than design flood magnitude. In the
mountainous regions of Jianxi rainstorms occur with high intensities, flood peaks are high, and flood
levels rise rapidly and also recede rapidly. In view of this and the characteristics of typical floods
of different frequencies of occurrence, and also the fact that most storage dams in the project area
serve mainly irrigation purpose and only additionally for flood control, in general the flood control
effect of these storages is not significant. Reservoir operation procedure during floods should
therefore be in accord with the functions of the storage dam, and the principle of reservoir operation
is to see it that, subject to the prerequisite of dam safety, flood discharge from the reservoir is less
than flood inflow into the reservoir in order to avoid releasing large quantity of water from the
reservoir due to error of judgment. For dams not meeting the designed flood standards as
stipulated by the state and also having serious deficiency problems which will affect the dam safety,
measures should be taken to ensure their safety to avoid a dam failure.
2



11. In general, where dams are in relatively good shape, and where forecasting capability exists,
reservoir operation should be subject to the unified operation direction of the flood control authonty.
Subject to the prerequisites that dam safety is assured and that irngation and hydro-power interests
are safeguarded, and provided that reliable hydro-meteorological forecasts are available, the
procedure for pre-emptying the reservoir for flood storage may be adopted with the aid of the
forecasting capability. That is to say, at the start of a rainstorm and before the arrival of the flood
peak, water is released in advance from the reservoir to increase its flood storage capacity so as to
reduce the magnitude of peak spillway discharge, to delay as much as possible the release of peak
spillway discharge in order to reduce at key flood protection points the magnitude of flood peaks,
and also to separate the arrival of the flood peak due to reservoir discharge and that due to inflow of
flood downstream of the dam.
12. For dams basically meeting the designed flood standards as stipulated by the state and also
having some deficiency problems, the storage level in the reservoir should be controlled or other
measures taken during flood periods.
13. Operational strategy to deal with floods exceeding design flood magnitude. The basic principles to
observe are. to give full effect of the system of administrative head taking responsibility; to rely
principally on flood control facilities and combine this with flood rescue operations; to have an overall
strategy while ensuring key protection points are secured; to put overall, majority interests above others
and to unite all parties to combat floods; to have unified flood control direction and unified procedures
for reservoirs operation, to combine engineering and non-engineering measures; and to mobilize all
positive elements of the society to the extent possible. To deal with floods exceeding design flood
magnitude, the following tasks should be properly carried out:
(i) Improved heavy rain and flood forecast and warning. Existing meteorological and
hydrological forecast systems and existing automated reservoir-based hydrologic monitoring and
reporting systems should be fully made use of to improve on the forecasting and reporting of floods
exceeding design flood magnitude. The length of lag time between the forecast made and the
arrival of the flood is crucial in dealing with floods exceeding design flood magnitude. Once a
flood warning is received, the flood control authority should immediately study how to deal with the
situation, set out the measures to be taken, and direct unified operations.
(it) Strict flood control supervision. Establish a responsibility system to accountable for the
completing of the form of certification of flood control safety inspection.
(iii) Strengthening reservoir, river and dyke protection management and preparing operation plans
for flood periods. Organizations responsible for reservoir management should comply with the
Flood Control Regulations of the People's Republic of China and Regulations on Management of
Reservoirs and Dams Safety. To strengthen the management of dam safety, there should be staff
designated to regularly carry out dam safety monitoring and inspection, analyze information and
data collected in a timely manner, and at all times be fully aware of the performance and behavior of
the dams. When an abnormal phenomenon or unsafe element has been discovered, a report should
be lodged immediately with the superior authority and the flood control authority for timely
measures to be taken.
3



v) Establishing and improving computerized flood control network systems to ensure smooth and
rapid transmission of meteorological forecast, rainfall and water level information, information on
storage dams and flood warning. The speed with which flood information is transmitted is very
important for the protection of human lives and reduction of damage to property. In order to better
deal with floods exceeding design flood magnitude and to reduce to the extent of damage, the
establishment and improvement of regional hydrological forecasting and reporting systems should
be accelerated. For important large and medium-sized reservoirs, hydrological monitoring and
reporting systems should be established and improved progressively. Experience gained should be
summarized continuously. Meteorological quantitative forecast of heavy rain should be combined
with hydrological forecast of flood peaks so that flood warning can be issued as early as possible,
especially in the case of floods exceeding design flood magnitude the lead time of flood warning
ahead of the flood arrival should be increased as much as possible.
14. Flood warning. Trouble-free transmission of flood warning mininmzes loss of lives and
damage to property. Where there are likely zones of inundation along the transmission route, a
prior warning system should be established. Liaison and communication between reservoirs and
the flood control department should be strengthened. Before the onset of the flood season, all
communication facilities and equipment should be checked, tested and serviced to forestall
communication breakdowns during the flood. Flood warning signals should be standardized and
made known to all. Besides issuing flood warnings through TV and radio, in day time a yellow
flag may be raised and a warning shot fired and during the night a fire may be lit and a warning shot
fired.
15. Evacuation. Once water in a reservoir reaches a high level, and there is a need to increase
spillway discharge, residents downstream of the dam should be notified, especially those living in
low-lying areas to ensure that they are moved safety to higher ground, and damage to property is
minimized. Evacuation of residents downstream of a dam should be organized by the local flood
control command headquarters. The personnel responsible for directing evacuation operations, the
order and procedure of evacuation, the routes to be followed during an evacuation, and the places to
which the evacuees are to be moved, etc. must be pre-determined in advance. All these should be
documented and publicized.
16. Once a danger situation arises, the local flood-control command headquarters should mobilize
emergency man-power such as the army and others and facilities through the provincial
flood-control command system to assist in rescue work.
17. Increase of financial provision for flood control. Flood control funds should be established
and flood insurance taken out. The provision for flood control should be included in the local fiscal
budget in accordance with the Flood Control Regulations of the People's Republic of Chinia. This is
the best economic guarantee of protection against floods exceeding design flood magnitude.

DRAFT
Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project
Irrigation Component
Guide for Operation and Maintenance of Dams
I.     Organizations Responsible for Operation and Maintenance of Dams
These are existing organizations responsible for the operation and maintenance of dams in the
project area, including county Water Conservancy Bureaus, Reservoir Management Bureaus,
Township/Town Water Conservancy Stations.
II.    Main Facilities for Operation and Maintenance of Dams
The facilities to be provided for operation and maintenance should be appropriate to meet
practicable needs consistent with economy. Existing facilities should be made full use of,
supplemented by the acquisition of other necessary items.
1. Instrumentation for monitoring water level and rainfall
Four water level stations should be established and equipped with staff gauges: one in front of
the dam, one at the imgation intake channel, and one each at upstream and downstream of the
flood gate. A float-type water level recorder should be installed in the reservoir. In addition,
one to three automatic rainfall recorders equipped with remote sensing device should be
installed at the dam and in the reservoir area. In accordance with current requirements, dams
must be included in the province-wide flood control network, and subject to unified reservoirs
operation procedures during flood times. As such, an adequate set of automated water level and
rainfall measurement equipment must be installed with the necessary authomated monitoring
device.
2. Instrumentation for monitoring hydraulic structures
The structures to be monitored include principally dams, spillways, irrigation canals. The
instrutmentation and equipment required are as follows:
(1) Settlement observation stations;
(2) Ground level bench mark stations;
(3) One set of high-precision theodolite and one set of high-precision level;
(4) Steel-string type pore-pressure measuring instrument a/ or standpipe piezometers installed
in the dam body and foundation;
(5) Monitoring devices (various equipment such as MCU b/, ADAS c/I, etc)
a/ Instrument used to measure seepage pressure in the dam. The membrane of the sensor head is acted upon by the
pore-pressure, which is converted into frequency of vibration to be transmitted.
b/ Data receiving system for monitoring equipment
c/ Water level measuring instrument.



2
3. Space for monitoring activities
Housing and office space for monitonng activities should be provided according to the need for
reservoir operation and management.
4. Transport facilities
During floods vehicles, boats, etc. should be made available for emergency and rescue operations
according to the dam location and operational requirements
5. Communication facilities
As telephone exchange facilities are susceptible to breakdown during floods (e.g., telephone
lines may be destroyed by floods) resulting in communication disruptions, one
transmitter-receiver set and one mobile telephone should be additionally provided for flood
emergency operation work.
III.   Dam Operation and Maintenance Procedures
Operation of dams should be based on hydrological forecast and to the extent possible operation
for power generation should be combined with irrigation release. For dams with year-to-year
carry-over storage, storing of water in the reservoir should be optimized provided flood control
requirements are satisfied as a pre-condition..
All structures should be regularly inspected, maintained, and repaired. The operation, inspection,
maintenance and repair of these structures and facilities should be carried out strictly in accordance
with technical regulations and specifications. In particular, observation and monitoring of the dam,
spillway, and other important structures should conform to the technical requirements and data
collected should be compiled and analyzed in a timely manner. When problems are encountered, the
cause(s) should be identified and remedial measures taken in a timely manner. Sudden draw-down
of water level in the reservoir should be strictly controlled to prevent slip circle failures.
For dams with hydropower function, power generation and irrigation release should be combined.
Therefore, in addition to complying with relevant regulations of maintenance and management for
hydropower generation, reservoir operation rules should be unified to satisfy irrigation requirements,
to avoid the situation that the dam serves hydropower benefit at the expense of irrigation objective.
A duty shift system with proper accountability for work done should be established. Personnel
on duty should make entry of events and activities occurnng during the shift and a record of these
entries should be maintained.
In summary, effective procedures, rules and regulations should be established for the operation of
dams. Optimum reservoir operation procedures under various situations should be established to
maximize irrigation, power generation, flood control and aqua-culture benefits. Such procedures
should take into considerations the requirements of the departments involved, forecast of rainfall
situations in the reservoir area and overall requirement for flood control, as well as both short term
and long term objectives. In particular, reservoir operation during flood times should strictly
conform to the operational plan and operation regulation approved by the upper-level government
authonty, in compliance with reservoir operation requirements of the higher level authority
responsible for flood control, and taking into account rainfall and water levels forecast, to ensure
safe operation of the facilities.

IV.    Operation and Maintenance of Monitoring System
The successful installation of dam safety monitoring system is merely the beginning of putting
the system into operation. Its normal operation depends to a large extent on the maintenance of the
system so that it can serve the purpose of dam safety monitoring.
1. Management of the system
(1) Define responsibility: County Water Conservancy and Hydro-electric Bureau should be
directly responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.
(2) Establish full-time dam safety monitoring groups: monitonng groups should have the full
complement of staff, including not only operators of monitonng equipment, but also
persons responsible for operation and maintenance of the computer system and data
checking and analysis.
(3) Establish regular reporting system: monitoring groups should submit quarterly reports to
county Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Bureaus on the operation of the dam safety
system. Quarterly reports should comprise two parts: (i) the performance of the dam
based on the information and data obtained in the monitoring process and (ii) the
operational conditions of the monitoring system so that county Water Conservancy and
Hydroelectric Bureaus are informed of their status in a timely manner.
(4) Strengthen the accountability of the monitoring groups: data collected should be checked
by the persons responsible. Where there appears to be abnormality, the data should be
double-checked; and if the data is found to be abnormal, the cause for this should be
studied immediately and the automatic measuring equipment checked if its functioning is
normal or otherwise. If the erroneous data found cannot be corrected or eliminated, this
should be recorded, and a report lodged immediately to the superior officer.
(5) Strengthen the recording and management of monitonng system operation: there should
be a record of observations for all system operations. Proper data collection, compilation
and analysis should be carried out. Where data abnormality occurs, a detailed record of
the faulty equipment part, extent of faultiness, and results of r ectification action should be
made. Such records should be compiled at regular intervals.
(6) Strengthen data collation, analysis and compilation Apart from day-to-day collation and
quarterly summary, annual data compilation should be carried out and completed at year
end or the beginning of the coming year. And a monitoring system operation annual
report should be prepared and submitted to the authority in charge.
2. System maintenance
(1) Necessity for system maintenance: an automated monitoring system is an integrated
system composed of various electronic parts and components and electric circuits.
Damage of any of these will affect the operation of the whole system. As deterioration of
electronic device is inevitable, the system cannot function well without proper
maintenance.
(2) Arrangement of maintenance fund: maintenance fund should be allocated as a separate
item in the annual budget of county Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Bureaus. The
fund must not be used for other purposes. Spare parts should be provided as appropriate.
Since the automated monitoring system serves directly dam safety purpose, system
maintenance can be included as an item in the annual budget for dam repair and
maintenance. The annual provision should be about 1% of the capital investment in the
automated system.
(3) Training of maintenance personnel: during installation of the system, experts from the
supplier should provide training. Training should cover the maintenance of instruments,
computer, communication equipment, and the system and dam safety aspects, etc.
3



4
(4) Strengthen relationships with relevant organizations: request these organizations to carry
out regular maintenance (every year or every two years). Also request relevant
organizations to assist in resolving major technical problems in a timely manner.
V.     Dam Safety Inspection
(1) County Hydroelectric Bureaus should maintain annual or semi-annual regular dam
supervision and site inspection during flood times.
(2) Areas of supervision: (i) dam safety situations and operational conditions of the
monitoring system; (ii) conditions of principal facilities for dam operation and
maintenance, (mi) compliance with maintenance and monitonng procedures and the duty
shift system and maintenance of shift record; (iv) preparedness for operation and
provision of man power and materials during flood emergencies; (v) status of follow-up
actions (including maintenance) and rectification of problems since the last dam
inspection; (vi) use of funds and linancial management;
(3) Supervision method: briefings, site inspection, review of data and records.
VI.    Provision of operation fund
It is necessary to have adequate funding support for proper operation and management of the
facilities. As such provision of fund to meet operation and management expenditure is very
important. Major items of expenditure include:
(1) Salaries, insurance and welfare funds for 0 & M staff;
(2) Maintenance and repair;
(3) Materials used in maintenance and repair;
(4) Energy;
(5) Other costs.
The funds required for operation and management should be rationalized according to the
magnitude of the tasks involved and obtained from various sources:
(i)  Where a dam has a flood control function, the requirement should be partly met by the
flood control fund (provided by finance bureau);
(ii) Where a dam is operated for irrigation, the requirement should be partly met by part of
the water charge collected based on the amount of water allocated for irrigation
