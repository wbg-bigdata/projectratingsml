SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 747-IN)
Project Completion Report
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Foodgrain
Storage Project, for which a Credit in the amount of US$107 million was signed
on January 1, 1978. The Credit was closed on February 19, 1986, at which time
the final disbursement was made and US$2.5 million were cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by Food Corporation of India (FCI). The IDA
overview and Evaluation Summary supplements FCI's review with IDA's observa-
tions, giving special attention to points and issues not fully covered by the
PCR prepared by FCI. The overview has been prepared by Asia Regional Office
and is based in part on the PCR, a review of the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 1643a-IN), dated November 3, 1977, correspondence with the Borrower,
internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files
as well as interviews and discussions with officials from the Borrower, and
experience during project execution.
Tne draft report was sent to the Borrower on October 31 for coaments;
however, no comments were received.
The project was not subjected to an audit by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 747-IN)
Project Completion Report
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The Second Foodgrain Storage Project followed the India Wheat
Storage Project (Credit 267-IN) which was implemented between 19W  and 1979.
The Second Project, the subject of the PCR, was intended to finance a four
year grain storage public sector investment project. Total project cost,
estimated at US$215.5 million, was to be supported with an IDA Credit of
US$107 million. At Credit closing, US$104.5 million was disbursed and US$2.5
million cancelled. The credit was closed in February 1986, four years behind
schedule.
Project Objectives and Rationale
The project int-nded to support India's foodgrain policy at the time
of appraisal in 1977. There were three major policy objectives: (a) self-
sufficiency in production; (b) price stability for consumers; and (c)
equitable foodgrain distribution. To support these objectives, IDA funds were
intended to increase FCI's storage capacity and reduce storage losses at a
time when FCI was handling up to one-third of domestic foodgrain marketing and
3.5 to 7.5 million tons of grain imports annually. Since about half of FCI
storage was at rented facilities and often under unacceptable conditions in
the open under polyethyline cover, it was decided to have FCI invest in new
storage facilities with a target buffer stock of 12 million tons. The p:oject
comprised: (i) construction of 3.5 million tons of foodgrain storage
consisting of 2.5 million tone bag, 1 million tons bulk, and 75,000 tons port
silos for grain loading and unloading; (ii) ancillary facilities for grain
handling and transport; and (iii) technical assistance for project
implementation; operations research; and training of management and key
technical staff.
The Bank accepted GOI target "without going into arguments about the
12 million ton target" and agreed to finance both conventional and modern
storage facilities. The latter was expected to have a higher rate of
return. The alternative of private sector storage was not considered.
Project Implementation, Results and Sustainability
The project was implemented in eight instead of four years as
planned and investments were made only in conventional sagged godowns storage
facilities. In total, 3.5 million tons storage capacity was constructed while



- vii -
appraisal had foreseen 2.5 million tons godowns, pl. 1.0 millio;. tons bulk
warehouses and 75,000 tons silos. The ERR for the godown component was
recalculated almost the same as appraised, i.e., 19.92 against 19.72,
respectively, even though there was a cost overrun of 51x. However, despite
the increase of storage capacity, FCI's dependence on rented storage did not
improve in relative terms: it was about half at the beginning and rem2ined the
same at the end of the project. Hence the private sector invested at the same
pace despite lack of government assistance.
Sustainability of the civil works constructed under the project
should not be a problem since the godowns constructed are of simple structure;
they are used intensively and are expected to be properly maintained.
Findings and Lessons
The project established the total storage capacity planned (3.5
million tons), but all of this was the traditional, existing type; there was
no modernization compound (i.e., bulk warehouses and port silos) as agreed
during negotiations. It remains an unanswered question whether India and IDA
should have been more determined in modernizing storage facilities.
Furthermore, the question of private sector storage support was never
considered as an alternative to FCI-owned storage facilities. In IDA's view,
an important lesson is that the private sector would have beer more efficient
for the establishment of storage facilities and it would have been less costly
for Government as far as administrative costs are concerned.
Today, there are again plans to invest in bulk storage facilities in
India, albeit 10 years later.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 747-IN)
Project Completion Report
Overview
General
1.        The Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second Foodgrain S.orage
Project was prepared by the Food Corporation of India (FCI). This overview is
intended to supplement FCI's review results with IDA's observations. Special
attention was given to points not fully covered by the PCR prepared by FCI
(i.e., IDA performance, private sector alternative).
2.        The PCR summarizes the implementation and results of the Second
Foodgrain Storage project and discusses alternative grain storage issues. The
project followed the India Wheat Storage Project which was partially financed
with US$5 million each by Sweden and IDA (267-IN) between 1971 and 1979.  This
took twice the time estimated at appraisal and only half the number of silos
were constracted due to cost overrun. However, godowns (reduced from 10 to 9
because of land acquisition problems) were completed ahead of schedule. ERR
was estimated at 15% as compared with 25% expected at appraisal.
3.        The Second Foodgrain Storage had problems similar to those of the
Wheat Storage Project: it took eight instead of four years to implement the
project which also suffered from cost overrun problems. Furthermore, only the
godown component was executed, while bulk warehouses, port silos Aind the pilot
mechanized grain procurement centers were not completed and consultants were
only partially used.  Notwithstanding the  'bove, the PCR prepared by FCI
reports favorably on the project, in that it established 3.5 million tons
godown storage capacity as compared to only 2.5 million tons proposed at
appraisal. The ERR of this component was reestimated at 19.9%, similar to the
19.7% estimated at appraisal. While this analysis correctly states the ERR
per se it does not compare it with different investment storage types to
determine desirable or better storage. The PCR also describes the factors
contributing to time and cost overruns which were: (a) difficultie: in land
acquisition, (b) delays in the execution of railway sidings; and (c) inability
of some local contractors to perform work contracts satisfactorily. However,
it does not convincingly explain why: (a) only conventional godowns were
constructed under LCB procedure; (b) all items foreseen for ICB were not
executed; (c) training funds were only used &t one-fourth the finance
available; (d) consultants were used only in a small amount (one fifth); and
(e) land acquisitions and construction problems occurred, similar to those of
the first project, despite the lessons learned.
4.        Total project costs were estimated at appraisal to be Rs 1,886
million (US$215.5 million) to finance the corsLIuction of 3.57 million tons of
additional public grain storage capacity--2.5 million tons of conventional



- ix -
godowns for grain stored in bags, 1.0 million tons of flat bulk warehouses,
and 75,000 tons for port silos for handling imported grain. Furthermore,
finance was provided for auxiliary facilities for grain handling and
transport, technical assistance, operations research studies and training of
key staff. An IDA credit of US$107 million was expected to finance 50% of the
project cost, net of taxes and duties. Eventually, 3.5 million ton storage
capacity was constructed, but ali under conventional bagged godowns.
Regarding the construction expenditures for godowns, t'"ere was a cost overrun
of 51%, while total project cost as completed exceeded appraisal estimated by
19%; US$2.5 million of the IDA credit was cancelled at Credit closing.
5.        Project Objectives and Rationale.  The project intended to support
India's foodgrain policy at the time of appraisal. There were three major
policy objectives: (a) self-sufficiency in production; (b) price stability for
consumers; and (c) equitable foodgrain distribution. Foodgrain prices were
regulated to: (a) ensure reasonable prices to producers; (b) procure a sizable
portion of marketed foodgrains on behalf of GOI and State governments; (c)
release foodgrains through the public distribution system primarily in urban
areas at below market prices by a ration card system; (d) fix official
purchasing and distribution prices regardless of seasonal or locational
factors; and (e) build up sizeable buffer stocks to protect consumers from
wide variations in production caused by irregular and untimely monsoons. FCI
was engaged in procuring foodgrains at over 2,500 market centers and was
operating godowns at 1,700 locations throughout India. It was handling 10 to
35% of foodgrains marketed and, in addition, it handled 3.5 to 7.5 million
tons of grain imports per annum. Since about half of FCI storage was at
rented facilities and often at unacceptable conditions in the open under
polyethylene cover, GOI had decided to have FCI invest in new storage facili-
ties. Actually, a 12 million tons buffer stock was the declared target.
6.        The Bank appraisal accepted GOI targets "without going into the
arguments about the 12 million ton figure." The project was to finance
conventional and modern storage facilities. The latter were expected to have
a higher rate of return. The alternative of developing competitive commercial
distribution systems and private sector storage facilities for new investments
was never seriously considered.
7.        Project Preparation and Implementation.  During preparation IDA
clearly wanted to be involved in bulk type storage being considered more
efficient, but there were problems in discussing storage policy with GOI which
did not want to discuss its grain storage policy, which it considered a
sovereign, national matter involving security considerations. While IDA
wanted to "increase the bulk storage capacity" and "make a beginning in
developing an integrated system for handling, movement and storage of
foodgrains," GOI was primarily interested to quickly enlarge its storage
capacity through traditional storing methods, i.e., in godowns stored in bags
which were more efficient than storing in the open but less efficient tian
bulk storage.
8.        The agreed project as negotiated, howe.er, included all three
components: godowns storing in bags, flat bulk warehouses, and port silos.
Soon after credit signature, preparations were in place to implement all three
components. The credit was signed January 6, .978 and started off satisfac-
torily although there were problen, .ith appointing staff to implement  he



x 
project. Initially, there were no land acquisitions problems. Construction
of conventional godowns, for which retroactive financing was provided, started
well. However, the appointment of consultants for bulk warehouses and silos
was protracted and took place only in March of 1979, due to problems in
selecting a qualified firm because GOI wished to retain the lowest bidder. In
April 1979, IDA staff rated this project "problem free" but with disbursements
falling behind estimates. However, the positive evaluation dropped
dramatically when a supervision mission visited the project in September
1979.  The main issue was the project period since th? implementation
consultants had declared that project implementation would require eight
instead of four years, mainlv because of bulk warehouse and silo construc-
tion. IDA expressed concern about the time overrun and proposed modification
of the project without being specific, while FCI maintained that the
modernizing components should still be implemented. It was only in early
1980, after several reminders by IDA that GOI somewhat reluctantly proposed
that the flat bulk warehousing and silo component be reduced. Thus IDA failed
in its estimates of tne project implementation period and appears to be also
responsible for the eventual deletion of the technically innovative
components, even though the project actually stretched over eight years
anyway.
9.        Bank mission suggested retaining the above components on a pilot
scale with the establishment of two bulk storage facilities of 30,000 tons
each to test such facilities under Indian conditions.  But this was apparently
never done. From FCI's PCR it appears that the bulk and silo storage
components were finally dropped after a "high level railway team" visited
Europe, USA and Canada in late 1980.  The railway team advised after its
overseas trip against modified flat bed wagons fitted with paper retention
doors and proposed instead special bulk grain wagons. However, since such
special wagons were planned to become available after the project investment
period this component was dropped. IDA's repeated suggestion for further
study and pilot investments did not result in action. It appears that
opposition to labor displacement in the case of bulk storage was also a factor
for GOI's decision. Ironic&lly, in April 1984 FCI approached IDA for
financial assistance to construct "four to five million tons of silo and
horizontal bulk stores."
10.       In general, Bank supervision was satisfactory, concentrating on LCB
tender evaluation for the godown component and urging FCI to make all efforts
in limiting further construction delays. There were no major difficulties in
covenant fulfillment as far as FCI is concerned.
11.       Summary and Conclusion.  Unrelated to the project, IPdia had great
success in increasing its food grain production during the eight years of
project implementation. The country became self-sufficient in this sector and
public procurement increased from 59 million tons p.a. during 1976-80 to 83
million tons p.a. during 1981-85. As discussed in detail in the PCR and
reviewed in this overview all project investments were conventional bag
godowns only, even though the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-81/84-85) stated
"emphasis has to be on efficient and socially relevant marketing techniques
taking advantage of the economics of bulk handling, procurement and
distribution system."



- xi -
12.       All this took place in an atmosphere of rapid production and storage
increase of food grains overall. While India's public sector (covered)
storage capacity was 105 million tons at the time of appraisal (representing
57Z of total grain sterage capacity) this had doubled to 20.8 million tons by
mid-1985. Nevertheless, FCI dependence on hired storage capacity had not
changed: it was about half at the beginning and at the end of the Project.
Hence the private sector invested at the same pace despite lack of government
assistance. This raises a policy question: should India not leave ownership
and management of grain storage more to the private sector. A weLl-planned
line of credit could induce the private sector to invest more in storage
facilities which FCI could lease without having the financial risk of
utilizing such facilities. IDA believes that the private sector would be more
flexible using such facilities for storing products other than grains as
well.
13.       FCI's PCR concludes that delays were partly due to the fact that
"the Project did not receive the right order of priority." Research studies
were undertaken regarding "storage and transportation of grain in bulk in
relation to the existing bag handling system." What actually stopped any
investments in bulk storage appears to have been IDA's endeavor to execute the
project on time and the railway team's technical reservations after their trip
to western countries. These reservations, however, were never specified.
14.       While the Bank at the time of appraisal was convinced of the
economic advantages of modern bulk and silo storage, it was quick in dropping
this component when problems of timeliness occurred. Since the feasibility of
these components was not even tested during the project, one must conclude
that the project contributed very little to modernizing grain storage and
reducing its cost. Nevertheless, it made a sizeable contribution to
increasing India's storage capacity. FCI's overall assessment of the project
worth was as follows:
"Although the bulk storage components relating to flat bulk
warehouses, port grain silos, transport equipment, etc. were deleted
from the project content, the experience gained, particularly in
respect of initial designs and grain flow diagrams and proposed
systems developed by the consultants for port silos and for certain
cost efficient models of flat bulk warehouses, is expected to be
useful in the implementation of future projects with such
installations."
Eventually, India is likely to make appropriate investments in modern bulk
storage facilities. Actually, it approached the Bank in 1984, inquiring for
possible financial assistance. The ongoing Seventh Plan includes provision of
bulk storage installations and bulk movement of grain. It is, therefore,
unfortunate that the bulk storage component, included in the 1977 negotiated
project, was eventually dropped. Apparently, this type of investment is now
reconsidered by GOI, after 10 years.



INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 747-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Introduction
This document presents the project completion report (PCR) on the
Second Foodgrain Storage Project undertaken with the financial assistance from
the World Bank/IDA by the Government of India under Phase II program. Credit
agreement was signed by the IDA/GOI on January 6, 1978 and FCI was to imple-
ment the total project under the overall responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Irrigation. The general guidelines for preparing project
completion report (including sector guidelines) of the World Bank have
provided the framework for this document. However, in view of the distinct
nature uf storage project viz. construction of godowns for scientific storage
of foodgrains unlike production or manufacturing project some deviations from
the general guidelines have been made in the presentation of PCR.
The scheme of presentation is as follows:
In Part I general perspective on food situation during the project
period i.e. from 1977 to 1986 is presented.
Part II covers specific issues and aspects of project implementation
in terms of physical and financial performance over the period including
departures made from the original project proposal.
Part III explains the contribution made by the project to Indian
economy in general and FCI in particular. The rate of return as originally
estimated and as expected from actual investment has been computed.
Part IV brings out the experience gained from the execution of such
a project.

I. FOOD SECURITY PERSPECTIVE
Food Policy Objectives
1.1       Food policy objectives of Government of India include:
(a) to ensure that the producers get reasonable prices and continue to
have adequate incentives for increasing the production;
(b) to ensure that consumer prices are stabilized and in parti:.ular the
interest of the low it.t-me consumers are safeguarded; and
(c) to build up adequate buffer stocks of foodgrains with a view to
ensure attaining of the twin objectives mentioned above/selling from
the buffer stocks to meet the shortage conditions and high prices or
by procuring for the buffer stock to support falling prices.
These objectives, enunciated during the Fourth Plan period continue to be the
focal points for the management of foodgrains by the Government of India.
These objectives have been part of the development and welfare strategy of the
Government of India. Break-through in agricultural production as a result of
Green Revolution in late sixties could not have been sustained without provid-
ing effectively market and price assurance to farmers. Over the last two
decades through periods of deficits and occasional surpluses, the FCI has con-
tinued its effqrts in fulfilling the food policy objectives of providing
effective price support to farmers, distribution of foodgrains at reasonable
prices and in achieving the target level of buffer stocks. The FCI through
its main operations of procurement, transportation, storage and distribution
of foodgrains has contributed significantly in transforming the food supply
management from the earlier drought/shortage prone supply to that ef a stable
food security system. Adequacy, stability and accessibility of foodgrains
have been achieved to a large extent as explained in succeeding paras.
Plan Priorities
1.2       Growth of Indian economy is highly dependent on the performance of
agricultural sector. Objectives in the Fifth and Sixth Five Year Plans of the
Government of India basically relate to the central theme of improving the
quality of life by way of bringing the people above the poverty line through
increased employment, agricultural and industrial growth, etc. The Seventh
Five Year Plan has laid emphasis on 'Food, Work and Productivity' as the basic
strategy for the perspective plan of 15 years ending 2000 AD. Attaining these
objectives involves implementation of agriculture-oriented development
strategy.
1.3       During the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-81/84-85) implementation of
food policy has been assigned a higher priority as would be evident from the
extracts reproduced below from the Plan Frame-work approved by the National
Development Council:



- 3 -
"Public distribution of commodities like foodgrains will have
to play a major role in ensuring supplies of these commodities
to consumers at reasonable prices. Likewise farmers will have
to be provided with remunerative prices by paying due
attention to their cost structure, to ensure that they have
adequate incentive to produce more particularly foodgrains,
pulses and oilseeds. It further suggested maintenance of
buffer stock to be absolutely essential in order to minimize
the impact of weather fluctuations on prices of foodgrains.
As such the public distribution system will be so developed
that it will hereafter remain a stable and permanent feature
of the Government's strategy to control prices and to achieve
equitable distribution. Towards this end, emphasis has to be
on efficient and socially relevant marketing techniques taking
advantages of the economics of bulk handling, procurement and
distribution system."
1.4       Foodgrains constitute a major share of agricultural production.
Problems of food production, its storage and movement across the country need
to be viewed on a wider convass specially because of spatial and price
imbalances in the demand vis-a-vis supply of foodgrains. These imbalances get
aggravated due to natural factors like drought, floods and famines in differ-
ent parts of the country apart from inadequate (occasionally excess) rainfall
at crucial times of growth of foodgrain crops in the main foodgrain producing
areas. This affects the income levels of the farming sector adversely. The
agricultural sector has, therefore, continued to receive higher priority in
the natural plan objectives since inception of planning era from 1950-51.
There has been almost three-fold increase in the foodgrain production in the
last three decades.
Assurance of Food Secutity
1.5       During the ven year period from 1977-78, i.e., from the start of
Second Foodgrain Storage Project in 1977-78, there has been continuous
improvement in all fronts of food management despite unprecedent drought
witnessed during 1979-80 accross the country. With adequate inventory of
foodgrain stocks with public agencies, adequate food security is assured. All
the three aspects of food security system viz adequacy, stability and
accessibility have been attained to a large extent. Brief account on each of
these aspects is presented below:
Adequacy
1.6       Growth Rates.  Attainment of adequacy is reflected by the tempo of
Green Revolution sustained by the country by registering growth rates of
production of wheat, rice and total foodgrains at a fairly high order
specially in wheat as shown below:

Annexure-G-II for details on growth rates.
Among various programs for increasing production, effective market and price
assurance by public agencies has been an important element in attaining such
impressive growth rates.
1.7       Market Assurance.  The degree of market and price assurance provided
by FCI and other public agencies is brought out in the following data:
Marketing years
1982-83    1983-84    1984-85    1985-86    1986-87

Extensive purchases through 6,800 purchase centers have provided effective
market nad price assurance to farmers. This effort has sustained increase in
the income of farmers and is providing the required impetus for higher
investment in agriculture and improved production and productivity.



1.8       Self Sufficiency.  In the past two decades, indigenous procurement
of foodgrain has been increasing at encouraging pace as can be seen from the
table below:
FOODGRAIN

Years (five years)       procurement      distribution        Z of distribution
1961-65                      7.23             32.28                  22.40
1966-70                     28.37             55.71                  50.92
1971-75                     40.07             51.76                  77.41
1976-80                     58.89             57.74                 101.99
1981-85                     82.79             71.40                 115.92
Source:   Annexure-G-III for year-wise details.
1.9       The perspective picture of the levels of procurement and
distribution by all public agencies including FCI given above brings out that
the procurement has substantially increased and has in fact been much in
excess of the distribution. It is in this context that India has emerged as
self sufficient in foodgrain requirement. In normal years, public distrihu-
tion aystem requirements are met by indigenous procurement. It is only in the
year of drought or abnormally low production that the supplies are drawn from
the buffer reserves held by the FCI. By mid-1985 surplus stocks over and
above the target level of buffer and operational stocks had emerged. The
extent of surplus was estimated to be around 7.0 million tons mainly in the
form of wheat.
1.10      Stability has been ensured as would be revealed by the pattern of
production in foodgrains, stocks levels with the public agencies, per capita
net availability of cereals, levels of public distr:bution and the index
numbers of wholesale price of foodgrains.
1.11      During the last one-and-a-half decade though the gross area under
cereal crops has not increased substantially yet there has been consistent
increase in the production which is contributed by increased productivity
(yield) as a result of expansion in irrigated areas apart from application of
better farm management techniques and the motivation provided by the public
agencies through continued market and price assurance for wheat/paddy and
rice.

Note:     Figures in parenthesis represent the percentage irrigated area to
total area under the crop.
1.13      This phenomenon is partially explained by the fact that assured
irrigation facilities are concentrated in Stttes like Punjab, Haryana, Western
U.P. where the irrigated area has continuousLy been increasing both for Rabi
and Kharif crops which helps in stabilizing the production to new levels.
All-India production is, therefore, less prone to fluctuating production
levels observed in some other States. In effect, stability in the production
levels in Punjab, Haryana and U.P. is imparting greater stability in All-India
production.



1.14      Increasing production levels in wheat and rice in Punjab, Haryana
and U.P. have enabled public agencies to concentrate their procurement efforts
mainly in these states. This is indirectly contributing to stability in
procurement also at higher levels.
1.15      Attainment of foodgrain production level of around 150 million tons
during 1983-84/1985-86 is indicative of the level around which the foodgrain
production may continue before shifting to new peak after few years. Produc-
tion data over the last three decades reveals that foodgrain production level
continues around a particular level over a few years (6-7) before it shifts to
a new level. The following data will explain this pattern:
(Million tons)
Gross production of foodgrain

1967-68/74-75                                94           108           100
1975-76/82-83                               110           133           124
1983-84/85-86                               146           152           149
1.16      Price Stability.  Apart from relative stability in production, price
stability is also essential. This is also achieved as would be revealed by
the wholesale price index numbers particularly of wheat and rice--the two
principal cereals handled by the FCI.

1.17      It would be observed that increase in price levels of wheat and rice
has been less pronounced compared to total foodgrain or all commodities during
the last one-and-a-half decade period. Likewise the prices of wheat and rice
have witnessed greater stability in the last one decade. Foodgrains being



-8-
important component of wage-goods, relative stability in the prices of wheat
and rice has had restraining impact on general inflationary tendencies in the
economy.
1.18      Inflationary conditions adversely affect the purchasing power of the
weaker sections. To protect their interests, the Government of India as a
welfare strategy fixes issue prices below the economic cost and meets the
difference in the form of consumers subsidy. Issues at concessional or subsi-
dized prices have enhanced the accessibility of the poorer sections. Adequacy
of stocks with public agencies has enabled continued access to the poorer
sections at reasonable and fixed prices, e.g., during 1980 and 1981 post-
drought years.
1.19      Though the procurement prices of foodgrains have continued to be
increased every year, the central issue prices of wheat and rice for the
supplies through public distribution system on the other hand have had longer
spells of stability. The following data is relevant:

1.21      The net accretion in foodgrains stocks held by Government agencies
during the two year period from July 1983 to July 1985 was about 12.0 million
tons, taking the actual stocks to a record level of about 29.0 million tons by
mid-1985 which was in excess of target operational and buffer stocks (21.4
million tons) by over 7.0 million tons, mainly in the form of wheat. Comfort-
able stock position has been achieved by increased procurement over and above
the distribution requirements. This record level of stocks has provided the
required stability in managing the food requirements of the country in the
long run. Moreover, FCI with effective management of surpluses and deficits
in different states having divergent food habits has been able to develop an
integrated national approach in tackling the food problem.
Accessibility
1.22      Accessibility of stocks is ensured through !e operations of the
public distribution system in the form of f rmal/informal rationing system all
over India. The objectives of distribution include adequate supply of food-
grains in different parts of the country specially with a view to supplement
the consumption levels of low income segment of the population and to keep the
open market prices under check. Though the supplies under the public distri-
bution system are of supplemental nature, these are made at concessional or
subsidized prices as a welfare measure to improve the diet and calorie intake
of poorer sections having low purchasing power.
Role of Food Corporation of India (FCI)
1.23      Procurement, storage and public distribution systems are essential
ingredients of the overall national food security system in India.  Unless
these are fully developed, the delivery system cannot be made effective,
efficient and economical. This task is, though, a joint responsibility of the
Central and State Governments, the role of Food Corporation of India (FCI) has
been vital. FCI being the national agency responsible to execute the policy



- 10 -
of the Central Government has expanded its organizational network both
geographically and functionally.
1.24      FCI today operates through a country-wide network with its Corporate
Office at New Delhi, 4 Zonal Offices for South (at Madras), North (at New
Delhi), West (at Bombay) and East (at Calcutta), 19 Regional O.fices covering
all the 22 Indian States and 7 Union Territories, 4 Port Operation Offices,
145 District Offices, about 2,000 Storage centers and 138 quality control
laboratories. The authcrized capital of the FCI was raised to Rs 10,000 mil-
lion duriag 1985-86 (from 4,500 million until 1984-85). The paid up capital
by the Government of India is Rs 7,440 million against Rs 3,075 million at the
close of March 1985.  For the purpose of construction of godowns, the capital
amount required is met by the Government under the centrally sponsored plan
schemes. For its day-to-day operations in foodgrains, it is allowed credit
facilities by a consortium of nationalized banks. The Government of India
gives surety against the margin money requirements and the hypothecation of
stocks with the banks. Within the cash credit limits, the FCI withdraws and
utilizes the money from the banks as per its requirements.
PDS Network
1.25      The public distribution system has been enlarged and expanded
considerably in the last two decades and today covers about 3.22 lakh Fair
Price Shops. The prevalent system envisages supply of foodgrains periodically
(weekly or fortnightly) of specified quantities at subsidized issue prices on
the basis of ration cards issued to families. Fair Price Shops get their
supplies from the wholesale agent who in turn gets the supplies from FCI
godowns. The range of off-take to total supplies from Government stocks has
gone up to 12-16 million tons/per annum in the eighties as shown below:

system has been facilitated inter alia by the development of storage capacity
under the World Bank aided project and other storage construction programs
launched by the Government ot India/FCI. Construction of storage godewns and

their operations in various deficit states has enabled the FCI to position
operational and buffer stock of foodgrains nearer the consumption areas,
1.27      In addition to supplies under PDS, the foodgrains are issued at
still lower rates under poverty alleviation program of the Government of India
such as Food for Work Program now replaced by National Rural Employment
Programme (NREP) (October 1980), Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme
(RLEGP), Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS).  These schemes have the objectives
of creating durable community assets in the rural %.conomy, provide direct
employment to the poor to augment their income level and raising the nutri-
tional standards. Government of India in December 1985 introduced foodgrain
distribution program in Integrated Tribal Development Project areas. Under
this scheme, issues in ITDP areas are effected at specially subsidized
prices. For wheat, the issue price is Rs 125/qtl as compared to Rs 190/qtl
for normal PDS. For common variety of rice, these respective prices, at
present, are Rs 160 and Rs 239.
1.28      Issues of foodgrains under these schemes are given below:

1986            Wheat               1,162        290        636
(Jan-Sept)      Rice                  121        43         615
1.29      As a matter of fact economic accessibility to the poorer sections is
ensured now under such programs by giving foodgrains at rates lower than PDS
rates. Releases under these schemes have also indirect influence on open
market prices. To tie over the problems of managing the surplus stocks the
Government of India has also taken various liberal decisions including Auction
Sales/Tender Sale initially and now, free sale of wheat by FCI at fixed
prices, issue of unrestricted wheat to Kuller Flour Mills, enhanced alloca-
tions under PDS, delicensing of Roller Flour Mills, reduction in issue price
to Roller Flour Mills, issue of wheat to cardholders under PDS without any
limit on quantity, etc. All these measures have had salutory impact on open
market prices rhich makes easy accessibility to grain by the poor.

1.30      Increased Transportation.  Inter and intra-regional transfer of
stocks from surplus areas is pre-requisite to ensure the accessibility of
foodgrain stocks to consumers.  Positioning of stocks in all the regions
adequate for the operational needs taking into consideration the time lag
involved in transportation lead is a critical operacion.
1.31      FCI operates about 2,000 storage godowns spread all over the
country.  FCI through continuous monitoring and coordination with Railways
formulates monthly movement plan to organize despatches of stocks to different
regions according to operational and buffer needs. FCI constantly monitors
transportation of stocks from the surplus areas of Punjab, Haryana and Western
U.P. in the North Zone where major part of surplus stocks (wheat and rice) is
concentrated. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh in the South Zone has surplus in
rice. Movement over long distances by rail is undertaken by the Corporation,
with the primary objectives to:
(a)  clear excess stocks from surplus States in the North Zone; and
(b) transport adequate stocks to deficit States in East, West aad South
Zones matching operational and buffer levels.
1.32      Short distance movement initially from the mandis to depot(s) and
thereafter to the rail-head and similar operations on the receiving end are
done by road. However, major transportation is by rail. The average distance
of movement in 1985-86 was around 1,533 km. The magnitude of foodgrain stocks
transported by rail have increased substantially as would be seen from the
following:

Storage
1.33      The programs of increasing production and expanding distribution
also requires a matching growth of infrastructures in the form of standard
storage accommodation. In order to ensure stocking of foodgrains all over the
country in optimum manner, storage construction program has been a major
activity of the FCI continuously over the years. Accordingly, under the
three-tier storage strategy of Government of India, FCI and Central Ware-



- 14 -
housing Corporation have been providing storage accommodation at centers of
All-India importance, the State Warehousing Corporations and the State Govern-
ment(s) at centers of State importari-e and at District levels and cooperatives
at primary and marketing society level which are located at vil.age and/or
Taluka levels.
1.34      The broad approach is to build additional scientific storage
capacity and to reduce dependence on hired capacity which is not up to the
desired standard as also to reduce dependence on the capacity under Cover and
Plinth (CAP).
1.35      There are three agencies in the public sector which are engaged in
building large scale storage/warehousing capacity viz Food Corporation of
India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and 16 State Warehousing
Corporations (SWCs). Over a period of time, sizeable scientific storage/
warehousing capacity has been developed by these public agencies and they are
implementing plans to increase it further. While the capacity available with
FCI is used for storage of foodgrains that with CWC and SWCs is used for
storage of foodgrains as also for general warehousing.
1.36      Since the Corporation did not have adequate scientific storage
accommodation in mid-seventies, this project was conceived in order to avail
the financial assistance of the World Bank, for bridging up the then identi-
fied storage gap of 7 to 10 million tons. The project was expected to replace
the then CAP and rented accommodation (unscientific) with scientific bag/bulk
warehouse storage capacity.
1.37      Increased levels of indigenous procurement over and above the
distribution requirement have been resulting in net accretion to stocks
occasionally. FCI's storage capability had, therefore, been under constant
pressure. Substantial net accretion of stocks during 1983-85 period (by 12
million tons) necessitated augmentation of storage capacity on high
priority. Apart from the ongoing construction programs under the World Bank,
etc., crash program was launched during 1984-85/1985-86 for providing
additional storage capacity of 2.42 million tons on priority within 15 months
at a capital cost of Rs 90 crores.
1.38      Cognizant of substantial accretions to foodgrain stocks, the ongoing
efforts to increase the storage capacity were stepped up during 1984-85. As a
result, the FCI, CWC and SWCs together constructed a storage capacity of 11.72
lakh tons for foodgrains during 1984-85 which was significantly larger than
7.09 lakh tons constructed by them during 1983-84. Notwithstanding these
additions, the total storage capacity available as on July 1, 1985 came under
considerable strain and proved insufficient to hold the foodgrain stocks as on
that date. This is because the stock level rose much more from 22.8 million
tons as on July 1, 1984 to 28.7 million tons as on July 1, 1985. Arrangements
were, therefore, made to accommodate over 7 million tons of foodgrains in the
open/CAP. Moreover to augment the storage construction capability, FCI
involved for the first time simultaneously a number of other engineering
construction agencies of the public sector to accelerate the pace of construc-
tion and achieve the targetted capacity.

1.39      The growth in the storage capacity both from owned and hired since
the commencement of this project has been as follows:

1.40      It would be observed that the dependence on the hired storage
capacity (both Covered and Open) has continued to be almost equal to the owned
capacity. Hired capacities specially from private parties are not necessarily
scientific and optimally located. To construct owned scientific capacity as
much as possible, special efforts were made to complete construction of
godowns during the last four years which resulted in augmentation by about
5 million tons including 2.37 million tons owned capacity as follows:

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Original Project Content
2.1       The original scope of the project consisted of construction of
conventional bagged godowns for a capacity of 2.5 million tons, flat bulk
warehouses for a capacity of 1 million tons and port silos installations for a
capacity of 0.075 million tons. The bagged godowns component of 2.5 million
tons included a capacity of 0.645 million tons completed earlier and picked up
for retroactive financing under the project. In physical terms, the bagged
godowns were proposed to be set up at 50 centers, flat bulk warehouses at 17
centers and the silos installations at the two ports of Madras and Haldia.
2.2       The summary of the physical conteeit of the project is as follows:
No. of       Capacity
Component                                     centers    (million tons)
1.   Bagged godowns (completed and picked up
for retroactive financing)                      87          0.645
2.   Bagged godowns                                    50           1.855
3.   Flat bulk warehouses                              17           1.000
4.   Port silos installations                           2           0.075
Total                                        156          3.575
Start-up Period
2.3       At the time of Project Appraisal, it was envisaged that land would
gradually become available at all the centers. The implementation schedule
provided that land for the bagged godowns centers would become available by
December 1978 and for the flat bulk warehouses by July 1979. This did not,
however, happen in reality. Though land was readily available for some
centers and the construction of warehouses at these centers also commenced as
per schedule, subsequent non-available and/or protracted acquisition of land
at many centers had a telling impact on the Project Performance resulting in
inevitable extension of the implementation period.
2.4       There was an initial delay to the extent of about 6 months in the
signing of Credit Agreement between the World Bank and the Government of
India. There was thus a corresponding extension in the date of commencement
of the project from mid-July 1977 to the beginning of 1978.



- 18 -
2.5       At the time of commencement of the project, works were undertaken
only at 11 centers for a capacity of 0.425 million tons where land was readily
available. The pace of implementation was seriously affected as land for the
balance of the centers did not become available as anticipated at the time of
appraisal. Even as late as in July 1980, land was available in full only in
respect of 31 bagged godown centers for a capacity of 1.168 million tons.
Revisions in the Scope of the Project Content
2.6       By this time, the agricultural pattern in the country had substan-
tially changed, necessitating a review of the project content. The experience
gained by the FCI in organizing rail movements from the Northern to the
Eastern Region in large scale drought situation during 1979 and 1980 also
brought out the need to identify new storage points.
2.7       In the meanwhile, the cost of essential construction materials has
also been increasing steadily. The escalation in the prices of materials from
1977 to 1981 has been to the extent of nearly 30%. For the remaining capacity
of the bagged godowns yet to be tendered and awarded, further price escalation
had to be provided in view of the continuing rise in prices. Evidently, the
estimated project outlay was considered inadequate to provide the total
storage capacity orginally envisaged at appraisal.
2.8       A review of the project content relating to the construction of Flat
Bulk Warehouses was also considered necessary in the light of the latest
developments regarding provision of bulk grain wagons following the recommen-
dations made by a high level Railway team after their overseas observation
tour in 1980. As a result of this review, the provision made for flat bulk
warehouses was scaled down considerably and changes in the scope and location
of the Port Silos installations were made to meet the demands of the changed
situation prevalent at that time. To make up for the capacity of dropped
centers, the component of the conventional bagged godowns was increased from
2.5 million tons to 2.708 million tons. Due to the difficulties experienced
in land acquisition and also keeping in view the need-based requirements of
storage capacity as relevant to the situation prevailing at that time. certain
centers were either dropped or their capacity suitability altered and addi-
tional centers were included. Fresh land acquisition proceedings had, there-
fore, to be initiated at this late stage in respect of the new centers which
were added to the project content.
2.9       The position of project content that emerged after the review of
April 1981 was as follows:



- 19 -
Capacity
(million tons)
Conventional bagged godowns:
Capacity covered under retroactive financing                0.645
Land available and works in progress                        1.168
Capacity proposed to be augmented at certain centers        0.225
New capacity added                                          0.670
Flat bulk warehouses                                          0.080
Port silos installations                                      0.050
Total                                                     2.838
2.10      The provisions made for setting up of Port Silos installations at
Madras and Kandla with the modified design and scope and establishment of flat
bulk warehouses on a reduced scale were critically examined both from finan-
cial and technical considerations during a review of the project in November
1981. While the silos installations were deleted from the project content for
reasons of dwindling imports and due to limited scope for steady export pro-
grams, the flat bulk warehouses were also deleted on the basis of the recom-
mendations made by the high level Railway team regarding availability of unit
train bulk grain wagons. Along with these, the provisions made for rural
procurement centers and road carriers were also deleted.
2.11      The scope of the project was now confined to construction of
conventional bagged godowns only. In order to make up for the shortfall in
capacity that arose on account of deletion of capital intensive bulk storage
components, the capacity of bagged godowns had to be necessarily increased.
2.12      The changed scope of the project content after this review of
November 1981 was as follows:



- 20 -
Capacity
(million tons)
Capacity (picked up for retroactive financing)                        0.645
Capacity for which works were in progress                             1.168
Capacity for which land was available within the
depot complexes                                                     0.560
Capacity for which land was yet to be acquired                        0.600
Total                                                             2.973
2.13      The capital outlay of the revised project worked out to Rs 1,900
million. With the deletion of capital intensive works relating to Port Silos
and Flat Bulk Warehouses from the project contents, the opportunity for
claiming 100% reimbursement for F/M components was lost. As the reimbursement
for civil works was limited to only 40%, it was evident that it would not be
possible to claim full reimbursement for the entire credit of US$107 mil-
lion. The World Bank was, therefore, requested to disburse the reimbursement
at 50X of the value of civil works retrospectively from the date of commence-
ment of the project against the stipulated 40%.
2.14      The World Bank agreed to the request of higher rate of reimbursement
on a condition that the vouchers relating to expenditure incurred received by
the Bank after September 1983 would only be eligible for reimbursement at 60%
of the value of civil works. As it was not considered feasible to claim full
reimbursement even at this revised rate of disbursement, it was decided in
early 1984 to include 105 centers to cover additional construction to the
extent of 0.610 million tons capacity. This resulted in a corresponding
increase in the capital outlay from Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,250 million.
Final Project Content
2.15      The final scope of the project was confined to the construction of
bagged godown at 275 centers for capacity of 3.526 million tons including 87
centers picked up for retroactive financing. The capital outlay is estimated
to be of the order of Rs 2,250 million.
2.16      The summary of the final project content is as follows:



- 21 -
No. of        Capacity
centers    (million tons)
Capacity picked up for retroactive financing                85           0.645
Capacity firmed up in 1983 and added within the
original outlay                                           83           2.271
Capacity added in 1984 with increased outlay               105           0.610
Total                                                               3.526
Implementation Period - Schedule vs Actual
2.17      The major factor that contributed to the time over-run was non-
availability and/or delayed acquisition of land at different stages of the
project implementation perict.  In most of the cases where land was available,
the construction was completed within a reasonable time frame.
2.18      The scope of the project. was firmed up in early 1983 and land for
all the centers covered under the project was finally available only in June
1983. The time taken to complete construction after this date up to the
project completion date of December 1985 was 30 months without considering the
works that are still in progress uider risk and cost arrangements. This is
within the time of 36 months provided by the World Bank in the implementation
schedule of the Project Appraisal Report.
2.19      The project was actually completed in December 1985 against the
stipulated date of December 1981. The balance works in respect of certain
centers which were affected by delays on account of 'risk and cost' arrange-
ments are still continuing and are expected to be completed in all respects
during 1987-88.
Factors Contributing to Time and Cost Over-runs
Time over-run
2.20      The single major factor that largely contributed to the time over-
run and consequent cost over-run has been the delay in land acquisition. The
other factors that could be identified in this regard are:
(a) delay in the execution of railway sidings; and
(b) risk and cost action taken in respect of contracts rescinded at
certain centers.



- 22 -
2.21      Land.  Non-availability and/or protracted acquisition of land
inevitably pushed the project implementation into a period of a completely
changed agricultural situation in the country which brought out the need for
revisions of the project content for a rational investment decision. The
construction had necessarily to be phased out depending upon the availability
of land resulting in extended implementation period.
2.22      Railway Sidings.  Siding facility was proposed to be provided for 44
centers under the project. In certain cases, delay in finalization of siding
plans by the Railways held up the commencement of works even after award of
contracts for the godowns as the plinth level of the storage structures had to
be fixed with reference to the incoming rail level of the siding. In certain
other cases, the rail levels indicated earlier by the Railways were subse-
quently changed due to the modifications carried out in their yard premises.
This resulted in increased quantum of work entailing more time for execution.
2.23      The extent of long and narrow stretches of land required for la-ring
the approach track to the siding from the take-off point to the boundary of
the storage complex could not be computed without approved siding plans
resulting in delayed acquisition.
2.24      As a matter of policy, the Railways started insisting that the
siding should have facilities for handling of a full rake within the storage
complex. This meant identification and acquisition of a suitable piece of
land to accommodate a full rake which were difficult and time consuming.
2.25      Another policy introduced by the Railways related to the procurement
of P-way materials by the private siding owners themselves. This posed
problems as there was considerable delay in the supply of rails by M/s SAIL.
Though these instructions were subsequently withdrawn by the Railways, the
damage had been done by then. The time over-run and consequent cost over-run
had already taken place in the execution of siding works.
2.26      Risk and cost action resulting in protected execution of works.  In
respect of a few centers, contracts had to be terminated on account of poor
performance by the contractors and balance works carried out at the risk and
cost of the defaulted contractors. This resulted in protracted execution of
works even beyond the extended project completion date of December 1985.
(Gudivada, Itarsi, Panvel, Patiala, Nabha and Wardha.)
2.27      The following factors also contributed to the time over-run:
(a) Initial delay in the commencement of the project. There was an
initial delay to the extent of about 6 months in the signing of the
agreement between World Bank and Government of India. As works
could be taken up only after formal signing of agreement on
January 6, 1978 the date of the commencement of the project in July
1977 as stipulated in the implementation schedule of the Project
Appraisal Report could not be adhered to.
(b) Larger number of bagged godown centers in place of Port Silos and
Flat Bulk Warehouses deleted from the scope. A larger number of



- 23 -
bagged godown centers spread over many different locations had to be
identified and included in the revised scope of the project after it
was decided to delete the provisisions made for Port Silos and Flat
bulk warehouses from the project content. Greater efforts in terms
of project planning, supervision of execution and allocation of
resources were necessary in such works cf scattered nature as
compared to the capital intensive works of port silos and flat bulk
warehouses located in limited number of centers. Larger number of
centers also contributed to the longer period of construction to a
certain extent.
Cost Overrun
2.28      The cost overrun has occurred as a consequence of the time overrun
that had already taken place mainly due to non-availability of land at several
centers as late as in December 1981 when the project was scheduled to be
completed. The other factors that contributed to the cost overrun were as
follows:
(a)  Works had to be undertaken at increased number of centers to make up
for the shortfall arising out of dropping the bulk components from
the scope of the project. This meant considerable time for prepara-
tory works as the centers were also scattered in different parts.
Besides this, the cost of works spread over many scattered centers
worked out to be more than that which could have been obtained at a
concentrated place.
(b)  The implementation schedule had to pass through periods of high
price rise from 1980-81 onwards and the provision of 7Z more towards
annual price rise at the time of project appraisal was extremely
inadequate to meet the situation.
(c)  The flat rate provision of Rs 60/ton of storage towards Railways
siding was unrealistically low. The cost increase in respect of
this segment alone has been to the extent of a staggering 250%.
(d)  The provision of Rs 20/ton of storage for roads and site development
and Rs 23/ton for ancillary buildings was also very low.
(e)  The 'risk and cost' action taken in respect of certain problem
centers resulted in unavoidable time and cost overruns.
Performance of the Executing Agencies/Materials Suppliers, etc.
2.29      The works covered under the project were shared by different
construction agencies besides FCI as per the following details:



- 24 -
Capacity
Agency                  No. of centers             (million tons)
FCI                           111                       1.597
CPWD                           104                      1.079
CWC                             32                      0.748
HPL                             19                      0.079
EPI                              9                      0.023
Total                     275                       3.526
2.30      Of these, CPWD is a central organization and has been executing
works concerning food storage for a long time. CWC has also got experience in
this type of construction for quite some time. The other organizations are
public sector construction agencies and were involved in the execution of food
storage works for the first time.
2.31      The works were entrusted to these agencies on 'deposit basis'.  As
the World Bank guideline for tendering, etc. were strictly followed by all the
executing agencies, no problem was encountered in the implementation stage and
the performance of each of these agencies was generally satisfactory.
2.32      However, sporadic shortages of essential construction materials like
cement, steel, AC sheets and tubular trusses did affect the Project
performance to a certain extent. Production constraints in the factories due
to power cuts, etc., and subsequent movement difficulties owing to non-
availability of rail wagons affected the supply position of cement consider-
ably which in turn had an adverse effect on the progress of works.
2.33      There was a considerable delay in the supply of AC sheets during
1981-82 as the rate contract for a new term could not be finalized by the
DGS&D in time.
2.34      A bulk order for supply of tubular trusses was placed on DGS&D
during 1982. Almost all the contracts finalized by this Central Purchase
Organization had to be terminated as no supplies were forthcoming in spite of
a very close follow-up with the suppliers largely due to a steep hike in steel
prices. The godowns though completed could not be put to gainful use without
the trusses and related components.
2.35      The progress of siding works entrusted to the Railways on deposits
basis was also affected due to non-availability of rails. The Railways had
stipulated that P. Way materials such 4.s rails, sleepers and other fastenings
should be procured by the siding owner and supplier to the Railways for
incorporation in the work. Substantial time overrun occurred as rails were
not readily available with M/S. SAIL and their rolling program also got
delayed considerably. This time overrun inevitably contributed to the cost
overrun that was to take place subsequently.



- 25 -
2.36      It could be that the factors that contributed to the delayed supply
of the above materials were beyond anybody's control.  However, it is felt
that the Project did not receive the right order of priority it deserved in
regard to release of materials. If a higher priority had been allocated by
central organizations like Railway, SAIL, DGS&D, etc. in regard to execution
of works and supply of materials to a need-based grain storage project of this
magnitude which was executed with financial assistance from the World Bank,
the problems that were encountered later due to nonreceipt of materials at
times of requirement could certainly have been reduced if not eliminated. To
this extent, the experience with these organizations was not satisfying.
Project Monitoring
2.37      The Project was subjected to a very close monitoring of its physical
and financial progress at regular intervals by the FCI management, the Depart-
ment of Food (Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies) and the Department of
Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance). Periodical review meetings were also
held in the Projects Implementation Division with the field Engineers, problem
areas were identified and appropriate remedial measures decided to avoid
spillages in the schedules.
2.38      The progress of siding works was reviewed with the concerned
Engineers at the Railway Board level and also with the respective Engineers at
the Zonal level.
2.39      The Projects performance was also reviewed by the World Bank Review
Mission which visited India for the purpose at frequent intervals. The
formats used for Information Reporting were suitably modified to have a more
meaningful and action-oriented review of progress of different components of
the Project.
2.40      As a final scope of the Project content was confined to the con-
struction of bagged godown only, several alternatives for claiming full reim-
bursement of the scarce IDA aid of US$107 million were considered and placed
before the World Bank for concurrence.
2.41      Such periodical reviews contributed substantially to the improved
pace of implementation of the Project and also resulted in higher rate of
reimbursement though to a limited extent.
Role of Consultants
2.42      In terms of the relevant provisions of the Credit agreement signed
by the IDA and the Government of India, domestic consultants were appointed to
assist FCI Engineers in the preparation of layout plans, designs, tender docu-
ments, bid evaluation and to supervise construction of flat bulk warehouses
and Port silos. The services of internationally recruited consultants for
certain man-months were also availed as provided in the Appraisal Report.
2.43      A substantial portion of planning and design work relating to Port
silos and some models of Flat bulk warehouses was also completed by the local
consultants with the help of their foreign counterparts. At this stage, the



- 26 -
revision in the scope of the Project content was being considered seriously by
the FCI Management and the Department of Food due to the changed agricultural
situation brought about by the factors such as bumper crops in the grain
producing states, difficulties in moving grains to drought affected states in
the Eastern Region and problems in land acquisition for several centers and
also on account of the continuing rise in prices contributing to the steady
cost overrun of the project.
2.44      As the components relating to the flat bulk warehouses and Port
silos were finally deleted from the scope of the Project, the services of the
consultants were also discontinued. However, certain basic designs developed
by them in respect of different models of flat bulk warehouses could always be
made use of as and when such installations are taken up for execution.
Research and Development, Operations Research and Training
2.45      As envisaged at the time of Project appraisal. onerations research
studies were conducted to ascertain comparative costs and ben;-Fits of
receiving, handling, storage and transportation of grain in bulk from in
relation to the existing bag handling system. A study report was also
completed in this regard.
2.46      It was also provided that designs would be developed for special
rail wagons for suggesting modifications to the existing wagons, etc. In
accordance with these provisions, a high level Railway team had gone on an
overseas observation tour in 1980 to select and subsequently design the type
of grain wagons for use in this country, the team discounted the suggestions
made for the use of modified flat bed wagons fitted with paper retention doors
and instead recommended special bulk grain wagons only for handling and move-
ment of bulk grain. As the availability of the first unit train with such
special wagons was expected only towards the end of the plan period and the
components relating to flat bulk warehouses and Port silos were subsequently
deleted from the scope of the Project content, these recommendations were not
pursued further.
2.47      The provision made for both domestic and overseas training meant
essentially for training experts in the operation and maintenance of flat bulk
warehouses and Port silos after such installations were completed as origi-
nally envisaged as it was thought that FCI Engineers and Indian Engirnering
services had only limited experience in bulk grain handling systems. As the
scope of the Project content was confined to the construction of bagged
godowns only consequent to the deletion of bulk storage components, the train-
ing facilities provided at the time of Project appraisal were not availed.
However, the overseas training availed by a team of middle level Managers of
the Engineering and Quality Control disciplines in similar bulk storage
installations of USA, Canada and Australia under the first Wheat Storage
Project (Credit 267-IN) financed by the World Bank jointly with Sweden was
considered for reimbursement of expenditure under this Project.
2.48      Though the recommendations made in the operations research study
report and by the high level Railway team were not pursued and the overseas
training facilities were not availed as provided mainly due to the deletion of



- 27 -
the bulk storage components of the Project, it is felt that the studies
already completed and the training availed under the Wheat Storage Project are
expected to be of immense use in our continuing efforts to create such bulk
grain handling facilities in the country in the near future.
III. ECONOMIC APPRAISAL
3.1       The project has contributed in a significant manner as has been
highlighted in Part I, in managing the national food security system. Storage
capacity completed in Phase II has augmented substantially the capacity of FCI
in expending the network of foodgrains. Some of the important benefits of the
project are:
(a) Storage capacity has been provided at 273 centers in the project.
These centers have expanded the network of godowns and facilitated
price support operations in surplus areas and distribution
capability in deficit areas. Physical positioning of stocks in
deficit areas not only assessed requirement and adequate
availability of foodgrains but also confiLaned speculative price
increases.
(b) Scientific storage capacity would help in reducing losses inevitable
in sub-optimal type of storage in 'CAP'.  Losses are estimated to be
comparatively less by 2% in godowns.  For 3 million tons foodgrain
stocks which can be accommodated in capacity provided by the
project, the loss avoidance is estimated to be 60,000 MTs p.a.
(c)  Scientific storage would enable better preservation, better quality
and avoidance of damage to foodgrains.
(d)  Create more employment potential during construction and later in
operation.
3.2       Construction of storage capacity continues to be a priority project
in the VII Plan also. Addition made with the project, during the Vth and VIth
Plan periods has given an impetus to storage construction program.
3.3       Economic Return.  An attempt has been made to compute the Internal
j         Rate of Return (IRR) based on the actual cost of the project.  Details are
discussed below:
Method.  To compute the internal rate of return of the project, two
alternative situations have been assumed. If 3.526 million tons
storage capacity was not constructed in the project period, given
the level of stocks, inevitable foodgrain stocks would have been
stored in 'CAP' (Cover and Plinth) storage complex. Such an
alternative will have less initial capital costs, but very high
operational costs in view of their sub-optimal locations and higher
percentage of storage loss. With such an alternative situation of
"without the project" is compared with the situation of providing



- 28 -
3.526 million tons conventional godown capacity. This situation
"with the project" would involve comparatively more capital cost
initially and less operational costs and storage loss.
3.4       To determine the net advantage of the situation "with the project",
net cost flows of 'Conventional godown complex' over the 'CAP complex' have
been computed over the years and IRR determined.
3.5       This method is similar to the one adopted in FCI's original project
report and the World Bank's Appraisal Report.
Capital Cost
(a)  Project outlay for 3.526 million tons conventional godown capacity
for bag storage. Rs. 1,723.5 million (Actual)
Per ton cost - Rs 489
(b)  Project outlay on railway siding with godown units having 2.038
million tons capacity Rs 526.5 million (Actual)
Per ton cost - Rs 258
Total average capital cost per ton
for conventional godown with railway
siding                                                       Rs 747
(c)  Road topping/civil works are expected to cost similar amount for
both 'CAP' complex and a conventional godown. Hence in working out
the net IRR--these cost flows have been ignored.
(d)  Similarly other maintenance costs for electrical works, etc. for
both CAP and conventional godowns are assumed to be almost the
same. Hence, the difference in cost flows have been ignored. Even
if one takes the exact cost flows, the overall impact on IRR would
only be negligible.
(e)  Salvage value of the godown in the 25th year has been taken to be
one-third of the original cost of Rs 747 per ton. The life assumed
is 35 years and the salvage value at the end of 25th year estimated
at one-third would be reasonable, in view of land and railway siding
components in the godown complex.
(f)  As compared to Rs 747 per ton cost of conventional godown, the
capital cost estimated for 'CAP' complex is estimated to be Rs 100
per ton. Hence the difference in capital cost of the two
alternative situations, i.e. 'with the project' and 'without the
project' has been computed.
Recurring Cost
(a)  Operational costs.  Operational and distribution costs per annum per
ton for 'CAP' and 'godown' complex are estimated to be Rs 171.20 and
Rs 82.06. The costs for 'CAP' are more than double on account of:



- 29 -
sub-optimal locations requiring extra transportation cost, addi-
tional transportation cost from the railway station to the 'CAP'
complex ('godown' are provided with railway siding facilities and
hence no such extra transportation cost); more deterioration of
grains in the open, more expenditure on spraying, etc.
(b) Storage loss. Storage loss per annum for these two alternative
situations is assessed at 3% for CAP and 1% for godown. Foodgrains
kept in 'CAP' are 'paddy' and 'wheat'. The average price for grain
adopted is Rs 2,000 per ton.
3.6       Internal Rate of Return (IRR).  Base on the above, IRR has been
computed to be 19.9%. In the World Bank's Appraisal report, the IRR computed
for similar complex (Model A) is also around the same level of 19.7%. The
estimated IRR at the beginning of the project has in fact come to hold good
even after the completion of the project. IRR of 19.9% can be considered as
reasonably good.
IV.  CONCLUSIONS
Project Performance Evaluation
I                                                                          w~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4.1       The project with an estimated capital outlay of Rs 1,900 million and
an implementation period of 4 years from July 1977 to December 1981 was
actually completed in December 1985 with an expected capital outlay of
Rs 2,250 million. The reasons for these time and cost overruns have been
brought out in the write up under the head 'Project Implementation' of this
report.
4.2       Despite these time and cost overruns which were beyond control under
the circumstances explained in the report, the Project has achieved its basic
objectives of providing needed grain storage facilities and has made a size-
able contribution towards buffer stock holding capacity of foodgrains in
keeping with the policy of the Government of India.
4.3       Although the bulk storage components relating to flat bulk ware-
houses, Port grain silos, transport equipment, etc. were deleted from the
Project content, the experience gained, particularly in respect of the initial
designs and grain flow diagrams and proposed systems developed by the consul-
tants for port silos and for certain cost effective models of flat bulk ware-
houses, is expected to be useful in the implementation of future projects with
such installations.
4.4       Due largely to nonavailability and protracted acquisition of land at
several centers covered under the Project, the implementation schedule got
extended into a period of changed agricultural situation of the country
necessitating large scale changes in the scope of the project content for more
rational investment. Once the project content was firmed up in early 1983,
the pace of implementation was also accelerated. The World Bank review
mission which has been reviewing the progress to regular intervals also took
note of this phenomenon and had left a note of commendation in their Aide



-30 -
Memoire while agreeing to extent the Credit closing date on the basis of
improvements made in the Project Implementation.  However, as the major time
overrun had already taken place due to non-availability of land and also on
account of the substantial changes made in the scope of the project content,
the consequent cost overrun could not be prevented though the negative trends
in this segment were contained to certain extent.
4.5       In keeping with the demands of the changed agricultural situation
during the course of implementation of the project, the decisions taken at
different stages to modify the scope of the project content with the concur-
rence of the World Bank are considered justified. The completion of construc-
tion of Port silos as envisaged at the time of Project Appraisal would have
proved irrelevant today in the context of steady surplus production of grain
year after year in the country as these installations were intended to receive
imported grain at the two ports of Madras and Haldia. On similar analogy, the
setting up of flat bulk warehouse would not also have served the purpose fully
as the mode of procurement operations at the regulated market yards continues
to be in the conventional form even today. In retrospect, therefore, these
decisions have proved to be sound and the investments made on the bagged
godowns turned out to be more rational.
Lessons Learnt for Implementation of Future Storage Projects
4.6       Land Availability.  The experience in acquisition of land for the
main structures and also for the rail siding continues to be frustrated. As
the acquisition proceedings are generally long-drawn and time-consuming, it is
considered desirable to have a firm commitment on the availability of land for
a substantially large number of centers even at the time of appraisal of the
project. Acquisition proceedings for the balance centers should also be
commenced immediately thereafter to ensure availability of land at all centers
at the time of scheduled commencement of the Project. Long and narrow
stretches of land for the approach track of the incoming rail siding should
also be acquired and handed over in time so that the storage is put to gainful
use with all related facilities immediately on completion.
4.7       Changes in the Scope of the Project Content.  Large scale revisions
in the scope of the project content during the course of implementation cause
several setbacks as have occurred in this project. The decision to reduce the
extent of and later delete the capital intensive bulk storage components from
the project content has inevitably resulted in the identification of a larger
number of bagged godowns storage points where the difficult and time-consuming
process of land acquisition had to be encountered at time when the entire
project was scheduled to be completed.
4.8       As such changes tend to contribute substantially to subsequent time
and cost overruns, it is considered desirable that the content once firmed up
at the appraisal stage, should not ordinarily be changed. Even if a need for
revision arises, the changes should be minimal so as to ensure that the
estimated implementation period and also the capital outlay are kept within
reasonable variations on actual completion of the project.



- 31 -
4.9       Changes in the Location of Centers.  As stated earlier, the changed
agricultural pattern in the country in general and the large scale drought
situation in the Eastern region during 1979-80 in particular brought out the
need for locating new storage points. In the process, preliminary works
undertaken at some of the centers had to be abandoned. This has resulted in
infructuous expenditure which could have been avoided. It is, therefore,
considered that changes in the location of centers, once approved that where
works are taken up, should be avoided to the extent possible.
4.10      Tendering Procedure.  As stipulated by the World Bank, prospective
bidders for the construction of even conventional godowns and ancillaries were
prequalified on the basis of certain criteria in regard to works experience,
annual turnover, financial capability, etc. before invitation of tenders.
This procedure resulted in limited competition and rather poor tender
response. As one or two tenders only responded to the bid invitation in a
particular area, contracts awarded to them at certain centers had to be
terminated on account of slow process and balance works executed at 'risk and
costt arrangements which are usually time consuming.
4.11      When the matter was taken up with the World Bank, it was readily
agreed to and open tenders were invited for the balance works. However,
certain minimum standards in regard to previous works experience were set to
ensure that only bidders with proven works experience participated in the
tender inquiry. This system worked satisfactorily. For further projects,
this position may be clarified to the Bank right at the time of Appraisal for
suitable incorporation in the relevant documents.
4.12      Interdepartmental Coordination.  As brought out elsewhere in the
report, the experience with other departments such as Railways, DGS&D, SAIL,
etc. was not very satisfying in that a need based grain storage project of
this kind executed with financial assistance from the World Bank did not
receive the due priority it rightly deserved in regard to release of
materials. In spite of the best coordination and follow up at different
levels of the management with these organizations, the progress of siding
works and release of essential materials like AC sheets, tubular trusses and
rails did not turn for the better throughout the period of implementation. As
a result of this, procurement of trusses and related components was withdrawn
from DCS&D and undertaken by FCI directly.  The procurement of rails and other
P-way materials for the railsidings has now rightly become the responsibility
of the Railways. As regards siding works, it is felt that a marginally higher
priority by the Railways will certainly improve matters.
4.13      Experience gained in implementing the project, particularly in land
acquisition, phasing of the project, time schedule of construction, estimates
of costs and their escalation, etc., would be of immense help in designing the
continuing construction programs in the coming years. To augment storage
capacity further in the VII plan period, a target of 7.5 million tons has been
set for all the Government agencies.
