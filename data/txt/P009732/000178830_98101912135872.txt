INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture, the largest sector in the Indian economy, accounts
for over 40% of GNP and about 70% of total employment. Foodgrains, partic-
ularly cereals, are the most important crops grown, accounting for about 75%
of total cultivated area. Foodgrain production increased at 2.3% annually
from 1953/54 to 1975/76, about the same rate as population increase. Food-
grain imports have taken place all these years to meet shortfalls in domestic
supply even though self-sufficiency has been a major economic goal of the
government since independence in 1947. Since the mid-1960's foodgrain pro-
duction has increased at the higher rate of 2.8% per annum, resulting mainly
from the successful green revolution in wheat. It appears that this higher
rate can be maintained or even increased, given the continuing extension of
irrigation and use of the new seed-fertilizer technology. Although imports
may continue through the 1980s, self-sufficiency can be attained gradually.
The weather remains the main determinant of the annual fluctuations in food-
grain production.. Recently, favourable monsoons have led to good harvests
in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and to record foodgrain stock levels (reported at 20.7
million tons in July 1977).
ii.       India's foodgrain policy has three major objectives:  (a) self-
sufficiency in production; (b) price stability; and (c) equitable foodgrain
distribution. Food pclicy is the responsibility of both the Central and
State governments. In 1964-65, the Government of India (GOI) established
the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to serve as the agency responsible for
implementing national food procurement and distribution programs. Instruments
of policy have included the use of food zones to regulate inter-district and
interstate trade; support, procurement and issue price regulations; procure-
ment, storage and distribution of seasonal and buffer stocks; imports of
foodgrains and rationing of public sector procured supplies to eligible con-
sumers at concessional prices. Foodgrain prices have been regulated to (i)
ensure reasonable prices to producers; (ii) procure a sizeable portion of
marketed foodgrains on behalf of GOI and State governments; (iii) release
foodgrains through the public distribution system in order to protect low
income groups; (iv) minimize seasonal and interregional price variations,
and (v) build up sizeable buffer stocks to protect consumers from wide
variations in production caused by irregular and untimely monsoons.
iii.      FCI operates with a Board of twelve government appointed Directors
under the general direction of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. A re-
gular staff of about 60,000 are engaged in procuring foodgrains at over 2,500
market centers and operating warehouses at 1,700 locations throughout India.
In recent years, FCI has procured annually 3.0 to 10.0 million tons, or 10 to
35% of foodgrains marketed, in addition to handling grain imports of 3.5 to
7.5 millicn tons per annum. FCI's distribution of grains at concessional
prices has ranged from 8.0 million tons to 14.0 million tons per annum.



- ii,-
iv.       About 18.5 million tons of storage space is available for storing
foodgrains in India, with 10.5 million tons in the public sector.  FCI owns
warehouses and silos with 5.5 million tons storage capacity, has under con-
struction facilities for an additional 0.4 million tons, and rents about 5.5
million tons of storage space but only 2.0 million tons of these are of ac-
ceptable standard.  Because of the acute shortage of space, it stores over
7.0 million tons in the open under polyethylene covers and stacked on plinth
bases (CAP storage).  The shortage of storage facilities of acceptable quality
has increased grain storage losses significantly.
v.        Current GOI policy is to procure and distribute 12.0 to 13.0 million
tons of cereal foodgrains annually and to build up a buffer stock of 12.0 mil-
lion tons by 1980-81.  FCI's share of this procurement and distribution activ-
ity would be about 9.6 million tons, with a peak load requirement of 7.5 mil-
lion tons. Without going into the arguments about the 12.0 million ton figure,
it would appear that a contingency stock of about 4.0 million tons would be
necessary to meet unforeseen immediate needs (see para 4.02). Given that FCI
would own only 5.9 million tons of storage capacity by the end of 1977, and
would be able to rent only another 2.0 million tons storage of acceptable
standard, the project's proposed 3.5 million tons of additional storage
capacity for FCI can be regarded as barely sufficient to meet its projected
requirements by 1980-81.
vi.       The ongoing Wheat Storage Project (Credit 267-IN), jointly financed
with Sweden, provides for the construction of 90,000 tons conventional ware-
houses (grain stored in bags) and 100,000 tons of silo storage (grain stored
in bulk). Construction of conventional warehouses was completed in 1974.
Silo construction, the remaining component, is expected to be completed by
March 1978, three years behind appraisal estimate, owing to the initial
delays by FCI in employing engineering consultants and acquiring project
sites. Despite the delays, the project is achieving its basic objective of
providing needed storage facilities and has given experience to FCI that
should be valuable in carrying out the proposed project.
vii.      The proposed project, the second of its type with FCI, would assist
GOI to implement its program of constructing storage facilities required for
public sector foodgrain procurement and distribution operations. The project
would finance the construction of about 3.5 million tons additional storage
capacity - 2.5 million tons of conventional warehouses for grain stored in
bags, 1.0 million tons of flat warehouses for grain stored in bulk, and
75,000 tons of port silos at Madras and Baldia for handling imported grain.
The project would also finance ancillary facilities for grain handling and
transport, technical assistance, operations research studies and training of
key staff.  With these additions, FCI would own warehouses and silos for a
combined capacity of about 9.4 million tons.
viii.     The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation would have over-all
responsibility for project implementation. The Secretary for Food and the
Central Storage Committee within the Ministry would coordinate actions among
the various GOI and State government agencies. Within FCI, a Project Imple-
mentation Division would be established under the charge of a chief engineer.



- iii -
FCI's engineering sections would be strengthened and would be assisted by
engineering consultants, including 60 man-months of internationally recruited
grain storage engineers.
ix.       Project costs over a four and a half year disbursement period are
estimated at US$215.5 million, including US$16.1 million in foreign exchange
cost. Storage facilities would require US$156.7 million, auxiliary items
US$17.9 million, and contingencies US$40.9 million.
x.        The proposed IDA Credit of US$107.0 million would cover 50% of
project costs, net of taxes and duties (estimated to be about US$2.0 million).
This is equivalent to the foreign exchange cost plus about 42% of local costs.
GOI would be the borrower and would use US$2.4 million of the Credit to pur-
chase railwagon equipment, to be owned and operated by Indian Railways. GOI
would onlend the remaining US$104.6 million Credit proceeds to FCI at an annual
interest of 10.5%, to be repaid in not more than 20 years including 4 years'
grace for principal and with 0.25% interest rebate for timely repayment.
GOI would finance the remaining US$108.5 million project cost in the form of
equity investment in FCI.
xi.       Civil works contracts for the two port silos (US$8.1 million) and
the bulk warehouse complexes (US$24.5 million) would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. Civil works contracts for bag warehouse
complexes (US$75.5 million) and rural procurement centers (US$0.9 million)
would be procured through competitive bidding following national and statewide
advertising. For railway sidings (US$18.4 million), civil works contracts
would be with the Indian Railways since the work is highly specialized
and requires close coordination with the existing railway system. Orders for
major equipment items would be bulked into orders of US$100,000 or more aud
tendered for internationl competitive bidding. Equipments not lending them-
selves to bulking and/or which cost less than US$100,000 when bulked would be
procured by nationally advertised tender while prudent shopping would be used
for items costing less than US$10,000. Vehicles would be procured on the
basis of nationally advertised competitive bidding from suppliers who would
be able to provide spare parts and maintenance services. Equipment costs,
including vehicles, are estimated at US$33.2 million.
xii.      At full development, savings from the reduction in operating costs
and grain storage losses would be about US$57.0 million annually. The project
would enable GOI to implement its national foodgrain policies more efficiently,
thus benefiting farmers with marketable cereal grains, and consumers through
more stable foodgrain supplies and prices. The estimated economic rates of
return are about 19% for the warehouse component, about 24% for the port silos,
and about 20% for the entire project investment.
xiii.     The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$107.0 million.






INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
A. General
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance for the
expansion of foodgrain storage and handling facilities to be owned and oper-
ated by the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The proposed project would be
the Bank Group's second foodgrain storage project in India. The first, the
ongoing Wheat Storage Project (Credit 267-IN), financed jointly with the
Kingdom of Sweden, provided for 90,000 tons of conventional bag storage and
100,000 tons of silo storage and is expected to be completed in FY78 (Annex 1).
The proposed project would provide additional storage for about 3.5 million
tons of foodgrains.
1.02      The project was prepared by a GOI committee which included represen-
tatives from the Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation, Railways and Finance
and from the Planning Commission, FCI and the Central Warehousing Corporation
(CWC). This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission comprising
Messrs. Dorris D. Brown and Kok Peng Teh (IDA), and H.J. Barre, F.E. Bender and
T.G. Burke (Consultants), who visited India in February/March 1977.
B. Background
1.03      The General Economq.  India's population of over 600 million is
growing at an annual rate of 2.3%. National income grew in real terms at
about 3.7% per annum between 1950-51 and 1975-76 and per capita GNP reached
US$150 in 1975-76. Per capita consumption.of cereal grains averaged 133 kg
during the 1950's, increased to 144 kg during the 1960's and is expected to
exceed 150 kg by 1980-85. Since 1950, annual per capita availability of cereal
grains has varied from 119 kg to 154 kg. GOI has imported cereal grains,
ranging from 2 to 16% of net consumption all these years, to provide for basic
nutritional requirements and maintain reasonable prices.
1.04      Although nationaL income has increased, there has been only a minor
improvement in the living standards of the urban and rural poor, who make up
about one-third of the population. During years of low grain production,
prices increase rapidly, beyond the means of low-income families. During
severe famines, masses of people suffer malnutrition. To alleviate this
situation, GOI and the respective State governments established ad hoc systems
of price ceilings at the primary market and consumer levels in the 1950s and
early 1960s, attempted various types of procurement from surplus areas for
transfer to controlled distribution areas, and established foodgrain zones to



-2-
control interstate or inter-district grain shipments. Foodgrains were also
imported to relieve scarcity conditions. As public involvement in the food-
grain sector increased, GOI established FCI in 1964 to operate a public sector
foodgrain procurement and distribution program designed to stabilize consumer
prices and assure an equitable distribution of the national foodgrain supply.
1.05      The Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture's share of net domestic pro-
duct ranges from 40 to 49%, about 2-1/2 times greater than the industrial
sector. Foodgrain production, particularly rice and wheat, dominates the
agricultural sector and is the dominant focus of India's agricultural devel-
opment policy. About 75% of total cropped area is devoted to foodgrains.
Likewise, about 75% of labor, fertilizer and irrigation utilized in
agriculture is for foodgrain production.
1.06      A basic problem of the economy is the low annual growth rate in
agricultural production, especially foodgrains, which has merely kept pace
with the 2.3% rate of population increase. However, with near ideal rainfall
conditions, foodgrain production increased more rapidly in 1975-76 and 1976-77,
providing a growth rate of 2.8% per annum. Most of the increase has been in
wheat production although rice production also increased substantially in
1975-76 (Annex 2).
II. FOODGRAINS IN INDIA
2.01      Production Characteristics.  Over 80% of India's foodgrain pro-
duction, i.e. cereals and pulses, is concentrated in 10 of the larger States.
About 67% of the rice production is concentrated in A.P., Bihar, Orissa, Tamil
Nadu, U.P. and West Bengal and over 80% of the wheat is produced in Bihar,
Haryana, M.P., Punjab, Rajasthan and U.P. In recent years wheat and rice
production has increased most rapidly in the northern and eastern States
where the combination of new varieties and added irrigation and fertilizers
has been highly profitable for farmers.
2.02      A major characteristic of foodgrain production in India is its wide
fluctuations from trend, due mostly to the time and amount of monsoon rains
received. Variations of 15 to 20% from trend have been experienced about once
every 5 years (See Annex 2, Figure 1). With production expanding at 2.3% to
2.8% per annum, a poor crop-year means famine conditions for millions of people
unless foodgrains are held over from the good crop-years as buffer stocks or
imported and distributed in the famine areas.  Other major factors influencing
increased production include the introduction of more responsive varieties,
use of more fertilizers and expansion of area irrigated.
2.03      Marketing Practices.  Only 30% to 35% of foodgrains produced enter
commercial marketing channels; about 65Z of production is consumed by the
producer families or used for feed and seed in the villages. About 38% of
wheat and 30% of the rice crop are marketed. Typically, farmers operating
less than 1 ha of irrigated land or 2.5 ha unirrigated land market very little,



-3-
if any, grain of their own production. Indeed, they may have to buy foodgrain
for family requirements. Price incentive programs benefit only those farmers
who market foodgrains.
2.04      Typically, in Punjab and Haryana, wheat is harvested in April,
threshed and delivered to a Regulated Market Yard in bulk form for sale in
April, May or June. At the market yard the wheat is displayed, auctioned,
cleaned, bagged, weighed and delivered to the buyer under the supervision of
government market regulatory agents. A 1% charge against sales value covers
costs of operating the regulated market system. In other States, where a
Regulated Market Act has not been enacted, buyers usually negotiate for the
wheat with each farmer and take delivery from the threshing floor or as agreed.
Paddy marketing practices are similar to wheat except that in some areas only
polished rice is marketed. In these cases the paddy is milled and the rice
bagged before delivery.
2.05      Storage Practices and Losses.  Farmers usually store grains re-
served for family consumption in traditional grain bins or gunny bags. Food-
grain merchants store their grains in bags in their own warehouses and rice
mills or in space rented from the Central and State Warehousing Corporations.
They may buy grain from the farmer and have him store it until needed. Co-
operatives store grain only on account for the State government or the Food
Corporation of India (FCI) or for their own current sales.
2.06      Storage losses depend on the moisture content and the type of
grain stored, type of storage, duration of storage, location and storage
management. Immediately after threshing, wheat has 10% to 12% moisture and
can be stored successfully. Paddy usually contains excessive moisture and
cannot be stored successfully without drying to below 14% moisture. For
wheat, losses under CAP storage are estimated to range from 3.8% for 6 months
storage to 19% for 36 months. For bag storage in-conventional warehouses, the
range is 1.9% for 6 months to 7.8% for 36 months, while for bulk storage in
similar warehouses, the range is 0.5% for 6 months to 2.0% for 36 months.
Losses are minimal in the low rainfall and low humidity regions of northern
India and high in the high rainfall, high humidity regions of eastern and
southern India. Finally, the regularity and quality of fumigration of grains
and maintenance of storage facilities determine losses from insects, rodents
and birds.
2.07      StoraRe Resources.  In 1975/76, India's warehouse storage capacity
suitable for grain was estimated to be about 18.48 million tons, withA0.48
million tons in the public sector and 8.0 million tons in the private sector.
These figures have remained generally unchanged in early 1977. A matrix of
grain storage use and ownership for 1975/76 is shown as follows:

2.08      FCI owns warehouses and silos with about 5.5 million tons storage
capacity and has under construction 100,000 tons of silo type storage and about
300,000 tons of conventional warehouses for bag storage. When these are com-
pleted FCI will ovn about 5.9 illlion tons of storage capacity. In addition,
FCI rented 3.7 million tons in 1975/76, which increased to about 5.5 million
tons in March 1977. Of this 5.5 million tons, only 2.0 million tons can be
considered of acceptable standard in a normal situation; the other 3.5 million
tons is hired only because of present storage shortage. Another 7.0 million
tons of FCI grain stocks are now stored in the open under polyethylene covers
and stacked on plinth bases (CAP). The project would replace CAP and rented
storage with safer bag or bulk conventional warehouse storage. When the
project is completed in 1981, FCI would own about 9.4 million tons of accept-
able quality grain storage space. Other than FCI, there are five main cate-
gories of entities which together own grain storage of about 13.0 million
tons: CWC which owns 1.24 million tons of storage, leases most of it to FCI;
State governments have 1.8 million tons, most of which they require for their
own grain storage; SWCs have 0.9 million tons and virtually all are leased to
FCI; Cooperatives own 1.0 million tons which are inadequate for their own
requirements; and the private sector owns 8.0 million tons, much of which is
sub-standard for storing grains. It is projected that Cooperatives would add
--about 1.0 million tons by 1980/81 to meet their own requirements and the
private sector would construct another 1.0 million tons, most of which would
replace existing dilapidated warehouses.  Thus, there is no major grain storage
construction program projected by entities other than FCI itself for the next
several years which might raise questions about the appropriateness of the
scale of construction program proposed for the project.
2.09      Transportation Resources and Practices.  Most foodgrains transported
more than 150 km from the primary market center move by railwagon. The Indian
Railways (IR), a public sector agency, owns and operates the nation's 60,000
km railway system. IR transports between 200 and 250 million tons of goods
annually. Foodgrain freight has varied from 14.0 to 16.0 million tons per
year in recent years, and mostly in unit trains carrying only grain. The
average haul distance is 920 kilometers. Details of the railway network are
given in Annex 6 and shown on IBRD Map 12880.



2.10      Whilst foodgrain transport has a high priority in obtaining rail-
wagon space, a number of constraints operate to increase the transportation
costs of shippers such as FCI. First, the maximum gross train load capacity
is about 4,500 tons because of the type of hook or coupling used between rail-
wagons. Train length is limited to 600 meters in most switch yards. Movement
is slow as round trip time varies between 12 and 15 days per 1,000 km distance.
The grain must be carried in gunny bags due to lack of grain-tight railwagon
doors and bulk loading and unloading equipment. A shift to the transportation
of wheat in bulk and larger capacity unit trains would reduce shippers' costs.
2.11      Foodgrain movement by truck is generally limited to distances of
less than 150 km but occasionally up to 300 km. Most truck transportation
is from a primary procurement market yard or port to a nearby warehouse and
from the warehouse to a railwagon or nearby consumer market. Transportation
by truck is of bagged grains.
2.12      Consumer Demand and Proiections.  Per capita foodgrain consumption
has been about 145 kg and is expected to increase to over 150 kg by 1985.
Production has ranged from about 84S to 98% of consumption, with the gap
supplied from imports, mostly of wheat. Projections (Annex 2, Table 14)
indicate a relatively higher rate of growth of foodgrain production than of
consumption, thus reducing the current 3.0 million ton annual import require-
ment to about 0.6 million by 1985-86. Current production at 115.0 to 120.0
million tons per year is expected to expand to about 145.0 million tons by
1985-86. With currently available storage resources fully utilized (Annex 5),
additional storage capacity would be needed to protect the expected increment
in foodgrain production and safeguard consumers from wide seasonal and annual
variations in supplies and prices.
2.13      Foodgrain Policies and Practices.  GOI foodgrain policy has three
major objectives: (a) self-sufficiency in production; (b) price stability;
and (c) an equitable foodgrain distribution to low income consumers. Through
the annually announced procurement price (which usually functions as the sup-
port price as well), backed by a readiness to purchase any amount of grain
at that price, it is intended to assure foodgrain producers of a stable,
reasonably attractive price in order to encourage increases in foodgrain pro-
duction, leading to self-sufficiency. The production effect of the procure-
ment price depends on the price elasticity of supply and whether the price
covers the cost of production. A recent Bank-sponsored study has shown that
wheat and paddy production in India is quite price responsive. 1/ This price
responsiveness of supply is thought to be more pronounced where the technology
of high yielding varieties is involved because its success depends crucially
on the provision of associated outlays, which the farmers would be reluctant
or unable to incur unless assured of attractive prices for their produce. The
Bank-sponsored study also showed that, broadly speaking, the procurement price
during the past decade did cover the cost of production. The present procure-
ment price of Rs 1,100 per ton for wheat appears to provide an adequate incen-
tive for increasing production; this may not be the case for paddy, whose

-6-
procurement price is Rs 740 per ton.  Market prices have more often been above
procurement prices so that, until April 1977, food zones were used, in which
grain surplus areas were cordoned off to restrict private grain trade, in order
to facilitate government procurement. The government distribution of domestic
and imported grains at concessional prices is intended to safeguard the in-
terests of low income consumers.  Although the ration cards entitling their
holders to government distributed foodgrain are issued to all those living in
the urban areas regardless of their income, it appears that the location of
the Fair Price Shops, the queues, the limits on quantities available, and the
lower quality of publicly distributed grain effectively ration it to lower
income groups. Following the foodgrain shortages of 1973 and 1974, the govern-
ment decided on the policy of building up 12.0 million tons of buffer stocks.
This policy is under review, the situation having changed completely; two
successive good harvests in subsequent years have resulted in foodgrain stock
levels being report1d at 20.7 million tons in July 1977.
2.14      Both Central and State governments are involved in establishing
and implementing food policy. GOI's Agricultural Prices Commission issues
foodgrain policy papers every year recommending procurement prices and
targets for consideration by the Minister of Agriculture and other cabinet
members. A meeting is then held of Chief Ministers and other State officers
to discuss and agree upon policy recommended by GOI for the coming season.
Implementation, in the form of grain procurement and distribution, is carried
out in each State by the departments of Civil Supply or FCI or both. FCI,
in addition, stores the grains it procures and arranges transportation of
grains procured from surplus States and imported grains for distribution in
deficit States. About 80% of public procurement of wheat and rice is handled
by FCI (India's foodgrain policies and practices are detailed and evaluated
in Annex 3).
III. FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA
A. General
3.01      FCI was established in 1964-65 by GOI to implement more effectively
its national food policies. It is required to undertake the purchase, storage,
transport, distribution and sale of foodgrains and other foods as decided by
GOI. In recent years, FCI has procured annually 3.0 to 10.0 million tons of
foodgrains (about 1OZ to 352 of the total marketed by farmers) and imported
another 3.5 to 7.5 million tons. The volume procured generally varies with
production and the relative differential between procurement and market prices
while the volume imported has tended to be highest during and after drought
years.
3.02      Management.  Under the general direction of the Ministry of Food
and Agriculture, FCI operates with a Board of twelve Directors appointed by
GOI. The Board selects an Executive Committee from its members, including the
Chairman and Managing Director who are responsible for day-to-day management
and operations.



-7 -
3.03      Staff.  A staff of about 60,000 on a regular basis operate 4 zonal
offices, 19 regional offices, 140 district offices and 5 port offices. Food-
grains are procured at over 2,500 market centers and stored in warehouses at
1,700 locations. Details are given in Annex 5 and IBRD Map 12880.
3.04      Financial Management.  FCI's financial and accounting systems are
centrally controlled from its headquarters. The general books of account
(ledgers, cash books and journals) and annual financial statements, including
profit and loss account and balance sheets, are prepared in accordance with
commercial principles. Detailed records are maintained at the zonal, regional
and port offices. Periodical returns are furnished from these offices to the
headquarters where the budgets, cost accounts and other financial statements
are consolidated. FCI's finance department is adequately staffed and includes
five specialized divisions - budget and cost control, accounting, finance,
internal audit and physical verification. Independent audits of FCI's annual
accounts are carried out jointly by two firms of chartered accountants. In
addition there are several other firms of chartered accountants functioning
as independent auditors of FCI's regional offices. Supplementary audits are
also performed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Accounts for 1976/77
have been audited and passed by the Board.
3.05      Operating funds are made available in the form of GOI owned equity
capital, GOI loans, commercial bank loans and overdrafts, depreciation reserves
and GOI deficit budget allocations. Assets currently in excess of Rs 21,000
million (US$2,400 million) are held mostly in the form of foodgrain inven-
tories. Details are given in Annex 4, Tables 2 and 3.
B. Analysis of Operations
3.06      Costs and deficit financing.  FCI, as a large, national public
sector business organization, is constrained by GOI policy from operating
profitably. GOI determines both domestic procurement and issue prices of
foodgrains marketed by FCI. Procurement prices are set at levels to assure
foodgrain producers of a stable and reasonably attractive price; issue
prices are concessional, intended to benefit low income consumers. Because
of these overriding policy requirements, PCI has never been managed as a
profit oriented institution, but has instead played an important role in
price stabilization and in ensuring some degree of equity in the provision
of foodgrains. For example, in 1976-77, the procurement price for wheat was
Rs 1,050 per metric ton and the issue price was Rs 1,250 per metric ton, a
difference of Rs 200 per metric ton. But PCI's operating costs 1/ alone, for
wheat stored in bags in a conventional warehouse up to 12 months, was Rs 337
per ton. If the length of storage increases to 24 months, the operating costs
become Rs 550 per ton. Thus, GOI has had to grant an annual subsidy to FCI
1/   i.e., excluding depreciation, operating costs are defined here to
include cost of procurement (excluding procurement price) and delivery
to storage, cost of storage and cost of delivery to State governments
for distribution.



- 8 -
which, in 1976-77 (a year of very high stocks), amounted to Rs 4,500 million
(US$514.3 m..Llion). FCI's deficit financing is inevitable, given GOI's -policy
objectives, and is not an indicator, one way or another, of efficiency. In
fact, it may be argued that FCI, in helping to fulfill GOI's food policy,
generates social benefits which are not reflected in its financial statements,
and the subsidy may be regarded as the price GOI is willing to pay for these
benefits.
3.07      Inventory Management.  FCI's Management Information and Control
Branch (MICB) collects and analyzes information received from the 1,700 ware-
house centers and uses it to assist management in determining grain movements.
Monthly, GOI advises FCI on the quantity and kind of foodgrain to be issued
to each State. FCI's operational division managers meet and, with the data
compiled by MICB, determine grain movements needed to fill requests. Time-
liness and accuractv f information appear to be satisfactory but there are
delays in receivide data from the field. Movement planning becomes more
complex as the grain volume and number of locations involved increase. A
computerized scheduling program could be useful in helping FCI's inventory
management.
3.08      Quality Control.  Stocks received for storage are analyzed by FCI's
quality control staff to determine moisture content and insect infestation.
Fortnightly, stocks are re-examined to determine grain condition and presence
of insects. Fumigation is undertaken if stocks show signs of infestation.
Prophylactic treatment is given to prevent cross infestation. Rodent poison
procedures are maintained. However, birds are not effectively controlled.
Training sessions are frequently held for the quality control staff at all
levels to exchange experiences in storing grain and to disseminate new infor-
mation. Within the resources available, FCI has done a fine job in quality
control, especially given the present large stocks and in particular, those
in open CAP which require intensive care.
3.09      Construction and Maintenance of Grain Storage Structures.  FCI
has two divisions dealing with the construction and maintenance of grain
storage structures. Each division is under the charge of a Senior Managing
Engineer. One division, with a staff of 787 engineers and draftsmen, is
responsible for designing and constructing new conventional bag storage ware-
houses and maintaining existing ones. It also hires engineering services
of the grain storage division of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD)
to design and supervise a part of the new construction. The other division,
with a professional staff of 246, is responsible for the design, construction
and maintenance of bulk grain storage facilities. It engages engineering
consultants to assist in the design, in tender documentation and evaluation,
and supervision of new construction. In the construction of new warehouses,
civil works and electrical and mechanical equipment contracts are usually
procured by nationally advertised tenders.

C. Review of Wheat Storage Project (Credit 267-IN)
3.10      The ongoing Wheat Storage Project, costing US$15.9 million, and  -
financed jointly with Sweden, originally consisted of 200,000 tons silo
storage and 100,000 tons of conventional warehouses for storing grain in
bags, training silo personnel and a study of India's foodgrain storage and
distribution. Credit agreement was signed in August 1971 but credit effec-
tiveness was delayed until November 1972 due to the difficulties FCI and GOI
had in engaging engineering consultants to assist in the design and construc-
tion of silos using the slip form method which was new to Indian contractors.
Land acquisition was more time-consuming than anticipated during appraisal
because, for some of the sites selected, land acquisition proved to be
legally difficult while for other sites, the locations were found to be un-
suitable with regard to grain receipt and distribution, and transport facil-
ities. Implementation was further delayed by the time required by FCI and
the engineering consultants to prepare and execute documentation for civil
works and equipment, and the requirement that the contract for coustruction
of the silos should be bulked and on a turn-key basis. This procurement
procedure was not practical and was subsequently abandoned.
3.11      The conventional warehouses were completed by 1974 and have stored
foodgrains since then. The India foodgrain distribution study was completed
by October, 1976 and provided valuable information for this appraisal report.
The silos are still under construction but are expected to be completed and
used for wheat storage by April, 1978, and the training of silo personnel is
underway. Despite the frustrating delays, the project is achieving its basic
objective of providing needed grain storage facilities. The experieuces
gained, particularly in procurement and land acquisition, should stand FCI
in good stead in implementing the proposed project.
IV.  TEE PROJECT
A. General
4.01      The project would assist GOI in carrying out its program of construc-
ting storage facilities required for foodgrain procurement and distribution
operations and improving foodgrain handling practices including bulk handling
activities planned for implementation during the next four and half years
beginning July 1977. The project would comprise: (i) construction of 3.5
million tons of foodgrain storage consisting of 2.5 million tons bag, 1 mil-
lion tons bulk, and 75,000 tons port silos for grain loading and unloading;
(ii) ancillary facilities for grain handling and transport; and (iii) tech-
nical assistance for project implementation; operations research; and training
of management and key technical staff. With project completion in 1981, FCI
would have storage of its own of about 9.4 million tons of foodgrains - 7.7
million tons in bags and 1.7 million tons in bulk. The proposed facilities
would be used for storage of wheat, paddy, rice and other foodgrains.



- 10 -
4.02      From 1980/81 onwards, annual public procurement and distribution
of wheat and rice is expected to be about 12.0 million tons and more (see
Annex 3, Table 12). Since its share of this activity is expected to be
about 80%, FCI would be handling 9.6 million tons by 1980/81. The peak
storage requirement, occuring in June (see Annex 3, Table 13), for this 9.6
million tons would be 6.0 million tons. (Procurement would be concentrated
during the harvest months while the off-take would be more evenly distributed).>
At any given peak, there would be some storage facilities that cannot be fully
loaded because they are located in pockets of poor harvest or are temporarily
inaccessible or because there is imperfect substitution between wheat and           p
paddy storage. Taking these factors into account, it is estimated that at
peak, the storage facilities on average would be only 80% loaded, so that
7.5 million tons of storage capacity would be necessary to handle FCI's
projected June peak of 6.0 million tons. The above calculations assume no
year-to-year fluctuations in procurement and demand on the public distribu-
tion system. In fact, fluctuations do occur in such a way that procurement
is high when offtake from the public distribution system is low, resulting
in rapid stock buildup, as occurred in 1975/76 when peak stocks rose to 18.0
million tons. Rapid stock drawdown can occur when procurement is low at the
same time demand is high, and maintaining supplies to vulnerable groups then
requires iarger than normal quantities of grain. GOI's policy is to build
the capacity to hold 12.0 million tons of grain in addition to those needed
for normal operations purpose; FCI's requirement would then be about 20.0
million tons. With this project FCI would own 9.4 million tons of capacity
by 1980/81. FCI would continue to make use of storage space rented from
other public and private entities; but only about 2.0 million tons of the
5.5 million tons currently rented is of acceptable statdard; the substandard
remainder is being hired because it is better than open, CAP storage. After
1980/81, FCI will have access to 11.4 million tons of secure storage capacity,
about 4 million tons above that needed simply for operations in a normal year
but 8.0 million tons less than needed to fulfill GOI's buffer stocking goals.
Stock accumulations above 11.4 million tons will have to be accommodated in
substandard rented storage or CAP storage. After the current building program
is completed, the GOI will have the opportunity to decide upon another tranche
of FCI's expansion program, either reaffirming current goals for Government-
owned storage or altering these goals in response to changed policies.
B. Detailed Features
ProJect Area
4.03      The 3.5 million tons of storage would be constructed in the States
of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka,
Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu,
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal at the critical grain procurement and distribu-
tion centers.  Criteria for selecting each location (town), site and type of
storage structure have included: (i) existing and projected procurement and



distribution; (ii) type, capacity and location of existing grain storage facil-
ities in relation to existing and projected procurement/distribution at the
proposed sites; (iii) transportation facilities serving the locale; and (iv)
climatic conditions (which determine duration of storage).  Locations are
listed in Annex 5, Appendices C & D. Proposed locations are shown on IBRD Map
12880. All sites would have road and rail access. Civil works would include
warehouses, office buildings, on-site road improvements and connecting rail
sidings. The two silo units would be constructed only at port side and would
be equipped to receive, store and handle imported grain. During negotiations,
the proposed locations and type of storage complexes to be built were agreed
with GOI and FCI. Since land acquisition for all project sites would be a
lengthy process (as evidenced by the first storage project), to enable the
project to get underway without delay, yet ensuring GOI's and FCI's commit-
ment to it, it was made a condition of Board presentation that land would
have been acquired for 28 or more project sites. During negotiations, GOI
provided evidence that 50 project sites had been acquired, so the condition
was easily met.
Storage Buildings
4.04      The project would finance construction of the following:
unit        Number of        Total
Model          Type        Capacity       Units         Capacity

Total                                 146           3,575.0
Designs and specifications are detailed in Annex 7.  Detailed cost estimates
for each type of storage complex are given in Annex 9, Tables 1 to 7.
4.05      Models A and B warehouses would be of identical dimensions: 21.8 m
width, 127.6 m length and 6.35 m height from floor to eaves. Model A is the
FCI conventional warehouse constructed with reinforced concrete columns, cur-
tain brick and mortar walls and concrete floor. It would have a rated static
storage capacity of 5,000 tons wheat in gunny bags and would be built in com-
plexes ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 tons. The Model B warehouse would be con-
structed with reinforced concrete floors and walls. Each building would in-
clude tunnel and aeration ducts used for grain handling, aeration, drying and
fumigation.  A grain conveying system, work bins and bagging machines would be



- 12 -
added. Bulk-head type doors facilitate grain storage in bulk or bag. Each
warehouse would have a static storage capacity of 12,500 tons wheat in bulk or
5,000 tons in gunny bags. Model B would be built in a complex of 52,500 tons
capacity including 2,500 tons of work bin space. The Model C circular bins
would store only bulk grain. Each complex would have a capacity of 52,500
tons, including 2,500 tons of work bin space. This model would be designed
for locations where groundwater conditions prevent construction of tunnels and
elevator pits at depths of over 5 m. The entire structure would be of rein-
forced concrete. An aeration system and conveying equipment would be provided.
The Model D hopper-bottom warehouse would handle and store bulk grain. It
would be constructed in complexes which store 52,500 tons of wheat, including
2,500 tons of work bins. Port silos would be constructed at Haldia and Madras,
where grain imports have ranged from 250,000 to over 1.0 million tons annually.
The slip form or other superior method of construction would be used, since
this method is less costly, results in stronger walls and has a lower likeli-
hood of leaks. The costs of a complex of 50,000 tons of wheat storage capacity
are estimated to be Rs 18.4 million for Model A, Rs 20.5 million for Model B,
Rs 22.2 milliion for Model C and Rs 19.0 million for Model D.
Project Warehouse Configuration
4.06      Although the estimated investment costs of a standard 50,000 tons
complex are higher for Models B, C and D than Model A, the operating cost
and grain losses of these bulk warehouses would be lower (Annex 4, Tables 5
and 6, and Annex 9, Table 11), and their estimated economic rates of return
higher. The project warehouse configuration, however, consists predominantly
of Model A for the following three principal considerations: (i) flat bulk
storage would not be suitable at most of the project sites because the match-
ing bulk transportation and handling facilities would not be available for
some time; (ii) many of the project depots would have throughputs not large
enough to warrant bulk handling; and (iii) flat bulk storage is still rela-
tively untried in India and should be regarded as a pilot development.
Rural Grain Procurement Centers
4.07      The project would finance two large and four small grain procure-
ment centers, equipped with facilities for-mechanical handling of the procured
grain (including temporary storage in some cases), and portable grain handling
equipment (cost US$1.7 million), for about fifty primary grain markets in the
states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
Under existing practice, most farmers deliver their grain (wheat) in bulk to
the primary market where the grain is placed in a heap on the market floor,
priced, cleaned, bagged, weighed, purchased by FCI (or other buyers) and then
delivered to the warehouse. The facilities to be provided by the proposed
procurement centers would eliminate the need for bagging; the grain would be
procured in bulk and transferred to the center. Alternatively, the grain may
be delivered directly by the farmer to the procurement center, bypassing
the primary market. At the procurement center, the grain would be graded,
weighed, and conveyed into elevated steel hopper bins where it is kept until



- 13 -
trucks transport it to a larger warehouse for storage or to the railways for
shipment to points of distribution. It is estimated that these centers would
reduce FCI's handling and transport costs by about Rs 33 per ton of grain
(see Annex 9, Table 7).
Grain Transport Equipment
4.08      Trucks equipped to transport grain in bulk would be provided to
FCI for delivery to storage facilities or from storage to flour mills. Paper
grain door retainers for existing modified railwagons and new special grain
railwagons would be provided to transport grain by rail in unit trains from
existing storage facilities and those to be financed under the project.
Details are given in Annex 6 and in Annex 9, Table 8.
Technical Assistance
4.09      FCI engineers and contractors have had considerable experience in
the constructiou of the Model A warehouse complex, having built it at more
than 1,500 locations. The layout, design and auxiliary units have been stan-
dardized and are acceptable to IDA. Nevertheless, FCI would need the assis-
tance of hired engineering services to construct 2.5 million tons of such
storage within four years. Hence, the grain storage engineering services of
CWC and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) would be engaged to assist
in the preparation of designs and tender documents and supervision of con-
struction. FCI engineers and Indian engineering services have had limited
experience in the design and construction of flat bulk grain storage ware-
houses and silos. Domestic consultants and 60 man months of internationally
recruited consultants would therefore be engaged to assist FCI prepare layout
plans, designs, tender documents, bid evaluations and to supervise construc-
tion for the Models B, C and D complexes and port silos. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that GOI and FCI would engage engineering services
and consultants, under arrangements and terms acceptable to IDA, not later
than March 31, 1978.
Designs Development and Operations Research
4.10      The project would provide Rs 4.0 million (US$457,000) for FCI to
strengthen its Planning and Research Unit and develop designs for special
railway wagons and modification to existing railway wagons, and conduct ope-
rations research studies to ascertain comparative costs of receiving, hand-
ling, storing and transporting grain in bag and bulk. These studies would
review relative costs and benefits of the different classes of warehouses -
Models A, B, C and D warehouse complexes as well as CAP storage - when used
in different centers 1/ and for varying periods of storage. Similarly,
alternative transport facilities and usage would be evaluated. Bag transport
would be compared with bulk transport using conventional trucks, special
grain trucks, paper grain retention doors on railwagons and hopperbottom
1/   at (i) primary procurement centers; (ii) intermediate storage centers;
(iii) urban distribution centers.



- 14 -
grain wagons. Such studies would be financed to obtain much more detailed
information concerning the costs and benefits of the system of bulk handling,
storage and transportation of grain (which would be provided under the project
as a pilot scheme), as compared to existing bag system, in order that the use
of existing storage facilities may be optimized, and the planning and design
of future storage projects be made more effective. Assurance was obtained
from GOI that plans acceptable to IDA would be prepared for carrying out such
operations research studies by December 31, 1978.
4.11      Training.  FCI would need additional staff, trained in grain hand-
ling including bulk transportation, quality control and accounting to manage
the new grain storage complexes. The project would provide Rs 3.5 million
(US$400,000) for both domestic and overseas training of experts for these
purposes (Annex 9, Table 9). During negotiations, agreement was obtained
from GOI and FCI that plans for training acceptable to IDA would be prepared
by June 30, 1978.
C. Implementation Schedule
4.12      Implementation of the project is expected to take four and a half
years, starting July 1, 1977 (with retroactive financing - see para. 4.15).
Expenditures for each of the fiscal years are estimated as follows (Rs mil-
lion): FY78 - 240.0; FY79 - 220.0; FY80 - 600.0; FY81 - 575.0; FY82 (6 months)
- 251.0. The detailed time implementation schedule for the various project
components is given in Annex 10.
D. Cost Estimates
4.13      Total cost of the project, including that of land acquisition and
contingencies, is estimated at Rs 1,886 million (US$215.5 million). The
foreign exchange component of Rs 139.7 million (US$16.1 million) represents
about 7% of total costs and includes grain handling equipment, expatriate
engineering services and training not available in India. Costs are based
on contract rates competitively awarded in mid-1977 for similar items. Phy-
sical contingencies for civil works have been calculated at 5% for Model A,
10Z for Models B, C and D and 15% for port silos. Physical contingencies for
equipment have been calculated at 10% for all models and port silos. Price
contingencies have been provided for at 7% per annum. Taxes and duties are
estimated to be about US$2.0 million for the whole project. The following

E. Proposed Financing
4.14      It is proposed that IDA provide US$107.0 million (Rs 936.0 million)
to finance 50% of the project cost, net of taxes and duties. IDA credit would
be to GOI and GOI would use US$2.4 million of the credit to purchase railwagon
equipment, to be owned and operated by Indian Railways. GOI would on-lend the
remaining US$104.6 million credit proceeds to FCI for a term not exceeding 20
years, including a four year grace, at an annual interest of 10.5%, with a
0.25% interest rebate for timely repayment. The remaining US$108.5 million
project cost would be provided by GOI as GOI equity in FCI. The 10.5% interest
rate, with 0.25% rebate is the standard formula that GOI uses for loans to
similar public sector undertakings at the present time. GOI would pay in its
equity contribution in annual installments in equivalent of US$15.0 million
for FY78, US$20.0 million for FY79, US$36.5 million for FY80, US$25.0 million
for FY81, and US$12.0 million for FY82.
4.15      In 1976-77, to alleviate the sudden acute shortage of grain storage
space resulting from a good monsoon harvest, FCI began construction of 900,000
tons of additional warehouse capacity, estimated to cost Rs 259.0 million
(US$29.6 million). At that time, preparation of the proposed Second Foodgrain
Storage Project was already close to completion, and the 900,000 tons capacity
of warehouse construction was included in the proposal. However, GOI felt that
it had to act quickly to meet urgent storage needs rather than wait for the
project to be appraised and approved. By July 1, 1977, about Rs 73.5 million
(US$8.4 million) of construction cost had been expended or tendered. The
remaining Rs 185.5 million (US$21.2 million) would be tendered after July 1,
1977, and it is proposed to include this under the project in the light of
the exceptional circumstances described above. It is proposed that expendi-
tures made prior to credit signing against awards be made eligible for retro-
active financing up to a maximumvof US$5.0 million, on the basis of standard
50% financing formula for India.
F. Procurement 1/
4.16      All procurement, including employment of consultants, would be in
accordance with Bank guidelines. In all international competitive bidding,
domestic bidders would be given a 7.5% preference on civil works.  A 15%
preference on equipment, based on the c.i.f price of each item or the actual
tariff applicable, whichever is lower, would be granted to the domestic
bidders. FCI would prequalify all domestic and foreign bidders for civil
works.
1/   Procurement costs are given inclusive of engineering services but exclu-
sive of contingency provisions.



-17-
4.17      Civil Works for Bulk Storage Facilities:  All civil works contracts
for bulk storage facilities (US$24.5 million) and the two port silos (US$8.1
million) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
To the extent practical, these contracts would be bulked.
4.18      Civil Works for Conventional Storage Facilities and Rural
Procurement Centers: Although in the aggregate the total cost of the bag
storage facilities would be very large (US$75.5 million), international com-
petitive bidding would not be suitable because the construction sites would
be scattered across the country, the value of each contract relatively small,
and Indian contractors are considered highly competitive. Civil works con-
tracts for these facilities, therefore, together with those for rural procure-
ment centers (US$0.9 million) would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised nationally and statewide under procedures satisfactory to
IDA. Tenders would be in packages of three or more contracts, except in
states with few storage facilities to be constructed. Contractors would be
able to bid for any one contract individually or for a combination of con-
tracts or for the entire lot.
4.19      Civil Works for Railway Sidings:  Civil works contracts for railway
sidings (US$18.4 million) are highly specialized, and need to be coordinated
closely with the existing railway system. Competitive bidding would not be
appropriate, and civil works contracts for each location would be awarded
by FCI (giving regard to economy and efficiency) to Indian Railways uader
procedures satisfactory to IDA.
4.20      Malor Equipment Items:  Procurement of weighbridges, temperature
indicator systems, aeration fans and ducts, railway scales, passenger ele-
vators and railwagon movers for all sites, and material handling systems
(grain conveyors, bucket elevators, truck dumpers, grain reclaimers, grain
valves, spouts) for all sites would be on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding. To the extent practical, these equipment would be bulked.
The special railwagons and paper grain door retainers would be packaged
separately and also awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
4.21      Miscellaneous Equipment Items:  Miscellaneous items not lending
themselves to bulking or expected to cost less than US$100,000 when bulked
would be procured by tenders advertised nationally, and prudent shopping would
be used for items which individually or when bulked cost less than US$10,000.
4.22      Trucks.  The 50 grain trucks would be procured on the basis of
nationally advertised competitive bidding from suppliers able to provide
spare parts and maintenance services.  (Equipment costs, including trucks,
are estimated to be about US$33.2 million).
G. Disbursement
4.23      The Credit would be disbursed against eligible expenditures as
follows: (i) 40% of civil works (US$59.0 million); (ii) for equipment



- 18 -
(US$38.0 million), 100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory), for orders awarded under ICB or 50% of other locally procured
orders; and (iii) 100% of expenditures for engineering consultant services,
training, designs development, and operations research (US$10.0 million).
Expenditures incurred on the project after July 1, 1977, but prior to Credit
signing would be eligible for disbursement up to a limit of US$5.0 million
equivalent provided procurement procedures employed are determined by IDA as
having been satisfactory. Disbursements would be made against appropriate
documentation and would be exclusive of land. The estimated disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 11.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
5.01      The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation would have overall
responsibility for the project. Within the Ministry, the Secretary for Food
and the Central Storage Committee (CSC) would be responsible for achieving
coordination of action among the various agencies within GOI and between GOI
and the respective State governments. FCI would be responsible for imple-
menting the project.
B. Prolect Implementation Division
5.02      FCI would establish a Project Implementation Division (PID), under
the direction of the Managing Director, which would be responsible for
detailed execution of the project. PID would be under the charge of a chief
engineer with at least 10 years experience of grain storage construction. It
would have three sections: (i) Conventional Storage Section, to be respon-
sible for the construction of all Model A bag warehouses; (ii) Bulk Storage
Section, to be responsible for the construction of all Models B, C and D bulk
warehouses, port silos and rural procurement centers; and (iii) Finance and
Administration section, to be responsible for the accounts and audits, per-
sonnel and legal matters of the project. The chief engineer would also super-
vise the preparation and conduct of the designs development, operations
research and training programs.

Grand Total                          1,758          2,685       4.443
Qualifications for the professional engineering and finance staff range from
the equivalent of a graduate or Master's Degree and 5 or more years of ex-
perience in their relevant fields to a Diploma and 1 or 2 years' experience
(details on pattern and qualifications of staffing are shown in Annex 8,
Appendix A).
5.04      The Conventional Storage Section of PID would not be adequately
staffed to execute the construction of 2.5 million tons of Model A warehouses
and to maintain existing ones. FCI would therefore enter into engineering
service contracts with the grain storage engineering sections of CWC and
CPWD for assistance in preparing designs and tender documents, evaluating
bids and supervising construction. Nonetheless, PID would be completely
in charge of the construction of about 1.5 million tons at 67 sites in 10
states.



- 20 -
5.05      The establishment of PID, and posting of the chief engineer and the
three Managers of the Sections, under arrangements terms and staff qualifica-
tions acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of credit effectiveness. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that terms and conditions of the CWC
and CPWD engineering service arrangements would be acceptable to IDA.
5.06      The implementation plan is shown in Annex 10.  GOI and FCI have
prepared full details of the plan, which was finalized and agreed upon
during negotiations.
C. Accounts and Audits
5.07      FCI would maintain separate accounts for expenditures under this
project. The annual budgets and accounts prepared by FCI should distinguish
project activities from its other operations.  FCI'seannual accounts would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Assurances were
obtained from GOI and FCI on these actions. Assurances were also obtained
that copies of these documents would be submitted to IDA as follows:
Annual budgets not later than one month prior to the
beginning of FCI's financial year;
Quarterly progress reports within one month of the
close of each quarter; and
Audited final accounts of the project within four months
of the close of FCI's financial year.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.08      On the basis of the detailed project implementation plan, the Chief
of PID (or, preferably, an assistant in charge of monitoring and reporting
to him) would monitor and compare actual project progress with that planned.
Problems could then be identified or foreseen, evaluated and action taken
to solve them to avoid slippage. IDA, through the receipt of a quarterly
progress report from PID (on land acquisition, tendering, bid awards, pro-
curement, disbursement, construction, training etc.) and periodic supervision
missions, would help to ensure the adequacy of the monitoring and evaluation
being carried out and to solve the problems that occur. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that FCI would establish a monitoring and evaluation
system for the project by June 30, 1978.
5.09      The operations research studies described in para 4.10, to be
financed under the project, would constitute an em-post evaluation of the
relative costs and benefits of the various types of warehouses, and more
generally, of the system of bulk handling, storage and transportation of
grain. This would help in the planning and design of future projects in
India.



- 21 -
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      Without the warehouse storage component, FCI procured foodgrain would
have to be stored in the open, under cover and plinth (CAP), and grain storage
losses would be extensive. The economic benefit of the warehouse component
would therefore be the reduction in grain storage losses and in the significant
savings on operating costs. The reduction in grain storage losses would have
the benefit of a saving on grain imports and therefore on foreign exchange.
lowever, grain trade will continue and the port silo component of the project
is provided to reduce the cost of handling such grain.
6.02      Project facilities would enable FCI to reduce storage losses by
180,000 tons of wheat and paddy per year valued at about Rs 200 million
(US$22.9 million) and to save on operating cost by about Rs 300 million
(US$34.3 million). The estimated economic rate of return is about 20% for
the entire project investment; it is about 19% for the warehouse component
and 24% for the port silos (see Annex 12 for underlying assumptions and
analytic procedures). The rates of return on wheat and paddy storage for
the various project components based on duration of storage are given below:

6.03      As can be seen, the bulk storage warehouses (Models B, C and D) have
higher rates of return than bag warehouses (Model A). Additional benefits
would arise from the resulting greater effectiveness of GOI's food procurement
and distribution operations, which would induce increased grain production,
enhance the welfare of producers and improve the real income of low income
consumers.



- 22 -
Project Risks
6.04      The major risk is the possibility of excess storage capacity,-due
to low procurement and low imports. It is, however, unlikely that the Food
Corporation's operational storage capacity would be much underutilized for
a prolonged period because the circumstances leading to stock depletion -
harvest shortfalls, high market prices, low public procurement and rapid
offtake of grain - also would lead to increased imports as the GOI tries
to maintain or increase levels of Governmental distribution of grain. The
chances that the relatively small capacity to hold contingency stocks would
not be used as planned are remote since weather induced fluctuations in
harvest size, price, and therefore in GOI procurement and distribution are
likely to continue.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, IDA obtained assurances from GOI and FCI
on the following:
(a) procurement would be in accordance with procedures stated
in paras 4.16 and 4.22;
(b) IDA would be informed on at least a quarterly basis of
progress in project execution (para 5.07);
(c) accounting and auditing procedures would be as set out in
para 5.07;
(d) a plan for developing designs and conducting operations
research by December 31, 1978 (para 4.10) and for staff
training by June 30, 1978 (para 4.11), acceptable to IDA,
would be prepared (para 5.08);
(e) a monitoring and evaluation system for the project would be
established by June 30, 1978; and
(f) the employment of engineering services and consultants
under arrangements and terms acceptable to IDA, by
March 31, 1978 (para 4.09).
7.02      As a condition of Credit effectiveness, GOI and FCI would have
established the PID together with the posting of the chief engineer
and the heads of the three sections (para 5.05).
7.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for an
IDA Credit of US$107.0 million to GOI.

INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Review of First Wheat Storage Project (Cr-267-IN)
1.        The project, costing US$15.9 million, and financed jointly with
Sweden, originally consisted of: (a) constructing and equipping ten silos
of 20,000 tons each and ten bag storage units of 10,000 tons each to provide
a total capacity of 300,000 tons; (b) training silo personnel; and (c) a study
of India's foodgrain storage and distribution. The project was intended to
help meet urgent storage needs resulting from rapid increases in wheat pro-
duction in Northern India in the late 1960's and to provide the basis for
developing a more effective nationwide system of grain storage and distri-
bution.
2.        The Food Corporation of India (FCI) was responsible for implement-
ing the bulk of the project - construction and operation of storage facili-
ties and training of silo personnel. The Credit agreement was signed in
August 1971, but did not become effective until November 1972. Numerous
further delays occurred after credit effectiveness, so that the project is
not expected to be completed until mid-1978, three years behind the appraisal
estimate. Reasons for the delays both before and after credit effectiveness
are discussed below in relation to implementation of project components.
Despite the frustrating delays, the project is achieving its basic objective
of providing needed grain storage facilities. The experiences gained, par-
ticularly in procurement and land acquisition, should stand FCI in good stead
in implementing the proposed project.
Silo Construction
3.        The Credit Agreement provided, as one of the conditions of effec-
tiveness, for the appointment by FCI of an engineering consultant acceptable
to IDA, for the design and supervision of silo construction using the slip
form method. This appointment took a long time because of FCI's unfamiliar-
ity with IDA's procedure for the appointment of consultants, and FCI's
internal administrative procedures. In accordance with IDA's procedure, PCI
had invited offers from three approved consulting firms to give particulars
only of their qualifications and experience. On this basis, one firm was
selected, and negotiations with this firm began. When the negotiations be-
came prolonged as a result of difficulty in reaching an acceptable price,
PCI called for offers with price quotations from the second and third firms,
explaining that the offers would not be open until negotiations with the first
firm had failed. This was considered by IDA to be a breach of procedure and
accordingly, FCI was requested to re-open negotiations with the first firm.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Negotiations continued to proceed slowly and were complicated by the involve-
ment of negotiating and reviewing committees and administrative clearance
procedures within FCI and the Food Department. It was not until nine months
later that agreement was reached with the firm on November 10, 1972. The
Credit was declared effective four days later.
4.        The Credit Agreement also required FCI to acquire all the 20 silo
and godown sites as a condition of effectiveness. Difficulties were en-
countered in the acquisition of these sites. In the end, when only one silo
site remained to be acquired, and when agreement with the consultant had
been reached, IDA waived the site acquisition requirement.
5.        Initial implementation difficulties encountered included a lack
of knowledge of the silo component requirements by FCI's key engineering
staff owing to lack of access to the project appraisal report and documents.
This was quickly remedied. Next and more importantly, the Joint Financing
Agreement stipulated a single-bid requirement for all ten silos and another
for all ten godowns. Implicit was the assumption that the civil engineer-
ing design and construction would be identical. Preliminary site surveys,
however, showed varying soil conditions between sites, requiring individual
foundation designs, entailing in turn different bin heights and diameters to
ensure economic construction. In addition, several of the proposed silo sites
were found to be unsuitable because of inability to acquire land, bad site
location with regard to receiving and distributing grains, and unavailability
of railway sidings and usable access roads. FCI therefore requested waiving
of the requirements for a single bid for 10 silo units in favor of multiple
invitation to bid for construction of those silos whose sites were suitable
and foundation designs completed. The request was agreed to by IDA in January
1974.
6.        During the delays caused by the above problems, costs, particu-
larly for silo constructiou, escalated and the project was reappraised in
early 1975. The number of silos were reduced to keep costs at the original
appraisal estimates. As revised, the project finances the construction
of nine 10,000 ton flat storage godowns, five 20,000 ton silos (at Khurja,
Lucknow, Moga, Jagraon and Modi Gobingarh), four bulk grain handling
facilities, staff training and an All-India Grain Storage Study.
7.        In March 1977, piling and foundation work had been completed at
all silo sites. Concrete work for the conveying system and headhouse was
about 20% completed at Khurja and Lucknow and ready to start at the other
three sites. Concrete work for the headhouse and silos was expected to
be completed by July 1977. Overall, about US$7.0 million worth of contracts
for civil works and about US$2.0 million for electrical/mechanical equipments
had been signed. All the silos are scheduled to be completed and ready to
receive grain by April 1978.
Warehouse Construction
8.        In its construction of warehouses, FCI ignored the single-bid re-
quirement long before it was waived, inviting separate bids and sub-contracts,



ANNEX I
Page 3
and awarding contracts for construction grouped by regions, as and when suit-
able sites became available. GOI pointed out that bulking into a single-b"id
requirement would reduce competition to only a few large firms who could
manage such a large construction job. GOI maintained that as a result of
separate regional bids, it was able to obtain much better prices because of
greater competition from a larger number of small firms. Owing again to its
unfamiliarity with IDA's requirements, FCI neglected IDA's procurement proce-
dures with regard to prequalification of civil works contractors, documenta-
tion of tenders, evaluation of bids, awarding contracts, and approval by IDA
of tender documents prior to issue and proposed award of bids. These problems
remained throughout the implementation of this component. Nevertheless, full
disbursement was finally made for 9 warehouses; disbursement was not made on
one which was excluded from the revised project. Apart from this however,
warehouse construction proceeded speedily.  At the end of 1973, five had been
coustructed and by early 1975, the remaining four were completed.
Staff Training
9.        The overseas training program for FCI's middle management techni-
cians who would be responsible for operating the silos under construction
was delayed but is now underway. FCI's Managing Director has agreed to
provide IDA with a proposed plan, including selection of the appropriate
overseas institutions.
All-India Grain Storage and Distribution Study
10.       This study, undertaken by the Administrative Staff College of
India, Hyderabad, was completed in October 1976. Copies of the main report
and 17 supporting studies were provided to GOI and IDA. The study provided
valuable information for this appraisal report.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Foodgrain Production, Consumption, and Prolections
A. GROSS FOODGRAIN PRODUCTION
1.        Although agriculture's share of net domestic product (measured in
1960/61 prices) has declined from 49% in 1960/61 to 42Z in 1970/71, and fur-
ther to 40% in 1975/76, it remains by far the post important sector, being
two and one-half times larger than industry in 1975/76. Foodgrains, parti-
cularly rice and wheat, dominate the agricultural sector, and occupy about
three-quarters of the cultivated land area. India's agricultural development
policy is largely focused on foodgrain production.
2.        The major determinant of year-to-year foodgrain production in India
(as in the rest of monsoon Asia) is the weather. Although the extension of
irrigation and greater use of improved technology (in wheat in particular)
have given India greater immunity to the vagaries of the weather, and may
have imparted a steeper upward trend to production, fluctuations in output
remain best explained by the weather. The good crop years of 1953/54, 1958/59,
1960/61, 1964/65, 1967/68, 1970/71 and 1975/76 were all characterized by good
monsoon rainfall, leading to a significant production increase over the pre-
vious year. New high yielding varieties and fertilizer aided in the produc-
tion increases of 1967/68 and 1970/71. Similarly, the poor crop years of
1957/58, 1965/66, 1966/67 and the early 1970's were due to droughts of vary-
ing severity. Since 1972/73, fertilizer shortages and high petroleum prices
have compounded bad weather in poor crop years.
3.        Total foodgrain production grew at 2.3% annually from 1953/54 to
1975/76. The rate of increase was significantly higher in the more recent
sub-period, 1964/65 to 1975/76, at 2.8%, than from 1953/54 to 1964/65, at 1.9%.
Examining the rates of increase for rice, wheat and other foodgrains for the
same sub-period, it will be seen that the much higher rate for wheat production
increase was mainly responsible for the higher growth of foodgrain production
from 1964/65 to 1975/76; rice, in fact, experienced a slightly lower growth
rate 1/ (see Table 1). This reflection of the success of the green revolution
in wheat since the latter half of 1960s, and the relative lack of it in rice
and other foodgrains can also be observed in Table 2. The growth in yield of
wheat more than doubled in 1964/65-1975/76 from 1953/54-1964/65, as a result
of the complementary inputs of higher yielding varieties, fertilizer and
1/ The base and terminal years of 1953/54, 1964/65 and 1975/76 were chosen
because they were all similar, good weather years, thus allowing a
better comparison of the trend.

irrigated land. The growth of area under wheat also increased significantly,
indicating the profitability of shifting from less profitable crops to wheat
and bringing land under irrigated cultivation with the new seed-fertilizer
technology. By contrast, rice experienced a lower growth rate in both yield
and area in 1964/65-1975/76 than 1953/54-1964/65. The picture for the other
foodgrains as a whole is somewhere in between so that for total foograins, the
rate of increase in area has remained the same while the rate of increase in
yield is somewhat higher in the recent period.
4.        A recent study 1/ attempted to divide increased foodgrain production
into components attributable to specific inputs - unirrigated land, irrigated
land, additional labor, and fertilizer - from 1949/50 to 1973/74. It showed
that the increase in acreage of unirrigated land was the primary source of
production growth from 1949/50 to 1956/57 (46%), remained a significant source
from 1956/57 to 1960/61 (20%) and then receded to insignificance in the later
periods. The increase in irrigated acreage increased in importance during the
period 1964/65 to 1970/71 (accounting for 29% of production growth), then
declined somewhat in the 1970/71 to 1973/74 period (22%). Fertilizer was
insignificant up to 1960/61, then accounted for 38% of the production increase
from 1960/61 to 1964/65 and 59% from 1964/65 to 1970/71, but dropped to 38%
from 1970/71 to 1973/74. Estimates for additional labor was more tentative.
Its contribution to production increase, though significant at all periods, was
rather variable, probably reflecting in part the changing importance of other
inputs.
5.        The State-wise production of wheat, rice, other foodgrains and
total foodgrains are shown for selected years, 1968/69, 1971/72, and 1975/76,
in Table 3. Uttar Pradesh has the highest foodgrain production for all the
years shown. In 1975/76, the share of the top nine states - Uttar Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal,
Rajasthan and TamiU Nadu - accounted for about 76% of total foodgra$n produc-
tion. Rice production is largely concentrated in the eastern and southern part
of the country, with West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Orissa and
Uttar Pradesh accounting for nearly 60% of total rice production in 1975/76.
Wheat predominates in the northern regions, and in 1975/76, two States, Uttar
Pradesh and Punjab, produced nearly 50% of the total and with Madhya Pradesh,
Bihar, Baryana and Rajasthan the share increases to over 80%. Some states have
diversified their foodgrain production rapidly. Punjab and Haryana have more
than doubled their rice production in the last decade and West Bengal,
Maharashtra and Gujarat have similarly increased wheat production.
B. Projections of Foodgrain Production
6.        The Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) in their report,
"All-India Grain Storage and Distribution Study" used the ordinary least square

method to estimate trend equations for rice, wheat and total cereals (foodgrains
minus pulses), based on two spans of time for their projections: (i) the full
span prolections, based on the period from 1954/55 to 1974/75, and (ii) the
half span prolections, based on the period from 1962/63 to 1974/75. The
half span projections were intended to reflect technological changes that took
place in agriculture in the 1960s. Projections were prepared for All-India
and for individual States. One of the two span projections was selected for
each State, depending on its relative explanatory power. Final projections
selected for rice, wheat and cereals were based mostly on half-span trends,
and are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Projections for cereal
production were further adjusted by ASCI to take account of the likely expan-
sion in irrigation in the different States. The All-India total remains the
same but the projections for each State were marginally altered. The adjusted
projections for three selected years, 1975/76, 1980/1 and 1985/86, are pre-
sented in Table 7.
7.        A medium-term forecast up to 1978/79 for foodgrain production was
made in the World Bank India Economic Report of 1976, using past input-output
relationships. 1/ A regression analysis relating foodgrain production to
irrigated and non-irrigated (rainfed) areas, using data for 14 States, for the
period 1964/65 to 1971/72 was carried out, yielding figures for average irri-
gated yield (1.364 tons/ha), average rainfed yield (0.389 tons/ha), and annual
average increase in irrigated yield (0.079 tons per year). It was assumed
that figures measuring the effect of additional irrigated area also measured
the impact of fertilizers or high yielding varieties. Using the above figures,
and on the basis of past input-output relationships, it was estimated that the
effect on foodgrain production of the addition of one hectare of irrigated land
would be a net increase of 1.4 tons, taking into account the proportion of
irrigated land likely to be used for crops other than foodgrains. Next,
the various elements of the Draft Fifth Plan irrigation target were examined
and led to the conclusion that the most likely increase in the total irrigated
crop area during the plan period (1973/74 to 1978/79) would be between 9.5 and
10.0 million ha, against the plan target of 11.2 million ha. At the rate of
1.4 tons/ha, this would represent a production increase of between 13.3 and
14.0 million tons due to irrigation over the five year period.
8.        For projecting production increase due to fertilizer, an estimate by
the Fertilizer Association of India of 1.4 million tons increase in nutrient
consumption over the Five Year Plan period was used, and assuming that the
proportion of fertilizer applied to foodgrain crops would be about 66Z (based
on NCAER estimate for 1971/72), an additional application of 0.92 million tons
of nutrients on foodgrains was projected.  In the calculation of the impact of
additional irrigation, account was already taken of the additional fertilizer
likely to be used on newly irrigated land; this totalled 0.275 million tons,
leaving 0.645 million tons of nutrients for use on existing irrigated or
rainfed foodgrains or new rainfed foodgrains. Estimates of the increased

foodgrain output that can be obtained from one kg of nutrient range from 6.5
kg to 13.0 kg depending on crop, variety and growing conditions. GOI used a
ratio of 7.33 kg foodgrain per kg of nutrient. At this rate, 0.645 million
tons of added nutrients would result in an additional production of 4.73 mil-
lion tons of foodgrains from 1973/74 to 1978/79. Finally, a further 1.8
million tons were assumed to come from the additional area put under rainfed
cultivation and 0.8 million tons from soil conservation. Altogether then,
the projected foodgrain production increase was 21 million tons, from 104
million tons in 1973/74 to 125 million tons in 1978/79 (3.75% per annum),
assuming a major effort to expand irrigated area and to increase the com-
plementary inputs.
9.        To make the ASCI and the World Bank projections comparable, two
adjustments were made. First, because the ASCI projection is for cereals
rather than foodgrains, it was assumed that the underlying annual growth
rate projections of 2.8% for cereal production from 1973/74 to 1980/81 and
2.9% from 1980/81 to 1985/86 holds t*ue for foodgrain production as well.
Second, the World Bank's projected growth rate for foodgrain, wheat and rice
production of 3.75%, 4.8% and 3% per annum respectively from 1973/74 to 1978/
79 is assumed to continue up to 1985/86. Table 8 shows the result. The ASCI
projection yields slightly higher wheat production but considerably lower
rice production estimates than the World Bank projections. The ASCI projec-
tions are more conservative for 1980/81 and 1985/86 and will be used in
this report. Thus, the estimated foodgrain production to be used is about
127 million tons in 1980/81 and about 146 million tons in 1985/86.
C. Foodgrain Consumption
10.       Net availability of foodgrains equals total production minus 12.5%
for feed, seed and waste plus net imports plus net stock depletion or minus
net stock addition and this amount is presumed to be available for consump-
tion during the year. On this basis, Table 9 shows the net production, imports,
net stock changes and net consumption of wheat, rice, other foodgrains and
total foodgrains from 1953/54 to 1975/76. Net production is simply calculated
from gross production figures (see Table 1), deducting for feed, seed require-
ments and wastage (see footnote of Table 9). Net imports are the difference
between imports and exports. There--oes not appear to be any pattern of total
foodgrain imports over the years, judging from total foodgrain imports as a
percentage of total foodgrain consumption. However, imports have been highest
during and after years of severe drought and have been less than 10% of con-
sumption. With regard to various foodgrain imports, wheat by far has been the
most important since the mid-1950s while the rice import volume has decreased
considerably since the early 1970s. Net stock changes reflect the combined
effects of fluctuations in net production, imports and consumption. Again,
there does not appear to be any disceruable pattern of net stock changes of
foodgrains, apart from such changes-tending to be of greater magnitude in the
1970s.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
11.       Foodgrain consumption grew at 2.1% from 1953/54 to 1975/76. - Con-
sumption growth in the recent sub-period, 1964/65 to 1975/76, has been sig-
nificantly lower, at 1.6%, compared to 2.6% for the earlier sub-period,
1953/54 to 1964/65. This is caused by the reduced consumption growth of both
wheat and rice; the consumption growth of other foodgrains has remained more
or less constant. Throughout, wheat consumption has grown at a much higher
rate than rice. The result is that wheat consumption as a share of foodgrain
consumption has increased from 15% in the 19509 to 20% in the 1960s, and to
about 25Z in the 1970s, while the share of rice has remained around 40% over
the period.
D. Prolection of Foodgrain Consumption
12.       ASCI, in its projections of cereal (rice, wheat and other cereals)
consumption in each State as well as All-India for the next decade, first
estimated the per capita availability in 1973/74 (taken as the base year);
again, this was taken to represent per capita consumption, and the results of
the first and final approximations are shown in Table 2 for each State and
All-India. It then calculated or assumed values for factors it considered
critical in forecasting consumption demand 1/. These factors were national
and State income growth, national and State population growth (from which
national and State per capita income and their percentage increases can be
computed), and income elasticity of consumption demand for cereals, all pro-
jected up to 1985/86. For each State and for All-India, the percentage
increase in per capita income, multiplied by the income elasticity of con-
sumption demand for cereals determine the coefficient or rate at which base
year per capita consumption of cereals will increase annually. The product
of this coefficient and the base year consumption, on further multiplication
with the estimated population for the coming years, projects consumption
demand for those years.
13.       For national income growth, ASCI used two alternative rates of
3.6% and 3.8%, partly because these were closer to past rates but mainly
because its supply. forecasts also were based on past trend. For individual
States, the past growth rates ranged between 9.5% for Haryana to about 2% for
Bihar, and it was assumed that the same trend would continue, subject to the
constraint of the All-India growth rate being 3.6% and 3.8%. On national
population growth, ASCI assumed a rate of 1.95% for the period 1975/76 to
1980/81 and a lower rate of 1.85% for the period 1980/81 to 1985/86. These
rates lie between the higher actual rates of the past and the lower rates
estlmated by the Planning Commission and the Registrar General. Similar
assumptions were made about State population growth rates, subject to the
same constraint that the weighted averages conform to the assumed rates for
the country.

tive Staff College of India, October 1976, Chapter 4 and Supporting
Study 2.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
14.       Using consumption data gathered during the 25th round of National
Sample Surveys (1970-71), ASCI calculated the income elasticities of consump-
tion demand for wheat, rice and other cereals, both for All-India and the
individual States. The All-India estimates of rural income elasticities are
0.53, 0.91, and -0.05 for rice, wheat and other cereals respectively; the
corresponding figures for urban income elasticities are 0.13, 0.39 and -0.81.
15.       Finally, ASCI calculated ratios of urban population to total popu-
lation for each State during the census years from 1931 to 1961 and used the
least squares method to project urbanization rates. This enabled the rural
and urban population for each State to be estimated during the forecast period.
Since income elasticities of rice, wheat and other cereals for both rural and
urban sectors were available, the consumption demand for each of them could be
computed for each sector using the estimated population. Consumption demand
for cereals for each State, and hence for All-India, could therefore be obtained
accordingly.
16.       Projections of consumption demand for cereals up to 1985/86 are shown
in Tables 11 and 12, for alternative annual national income growth of 3.6% and
3.8% respectively. Again, in order to obtain the consumption projections for
foodgrain, it is assumed that year-to-year growth rates for projected cereal
consumption holds true for foodgrain consumption as well. Foodgrain consump-
tion figures thus derived are shown in the last row of Tables 3 and 4.
17.       Table 13 compares the derived consumption figures from ASCI projec-
tions with those calculated by India's National Council of Agriculture (NCA)
for 1985/86. The derived total foodgrain consumption from the ASCI projection
is very close to the corresponding lower estimate of the NCA projection. In
all cases, ASCI projections fall between the lower and upper estimates of NCA
projections.
Food Balance
18.       The projected net food balance - the difference between projected
net production and projected net consumption - of wheat, rice and all food-
grains from 1976/77 to 1985/86 is shown in Table 14. Wheat is projected to
have an increasing positive net balance and rice to have an increasing nega-
tive net balance. Total foodgrains are projected to have a negative net
balance throughout but decreasingly so over time. Assuming that the negative
balance would be met by imports, foodgrain imports are then projected to
average about 2.6 million tous annually from 1976/77 to 1980/81 and about 1.2
million tons annually from 1981/82 to 1985/86. Moreover, on projected trends,
it would appear that self-sufficiency in foodgrains would be reached some time
at the end of the 1980s. Obviously, the result is dependent on assumptions
regarding production growth, national income growth, income demand elasticity
and population growth. The result does not seem particularly sensitive to
assumptions within the feasible range regarding income growth or income elasti-
city. The crucial assumptions are production and population growth rates. The
ASCI projection of foodgrain production is quite conservative, when compared
with the World Bank's, while the projected population growth rates are lower



ANNEX 2
Page 7
than those projected by the Planning Commission or the Registrar-General.
Thus, self-sufficiency would appear attainable, provided the Indian Govern-
ment continues to attach high priority to foodgrain production (this assump-
tion was also made by the World Bank projections) and to reducing population
growth from rates attained in the past.

INDIA
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
GOVERNMENT FOODGRAIN POLICIES AND PRACTICES
A. Objectives and Instruments of Foodarain Policy
Obiectives
1.        Foodgrain policy in India has three main objectives:  (a) self-
sufficiency in foodgrain production; (b) price stability; and (c) assurance
of an equitable distribution. These objectives are often restated as ensuring
that consumer prices are stabilized, that the interests of low income consumers
are safeguarded, and that producers receive reasonable prices with an adequate
incentive for increasing production. These objectives have been reiterated
in various forms since about 1870, with virtually no change since the Bengal
famine of 1943. However, a variety of policy instruments have been tried.
2.        Food policy is both a Central government and State subject in
India; implementation of policy requires concurrence by the State involved.
On the other hand, interstate trade and the import and export of foodgrains
are regulated by GOI. Thus, the complexity faced by any nation in developing
and implementing food policy has an added dimension in India's federal-state
structure.
B. Instruments of Foodarain Policy
3.        Food Zones.  A food zone as an instrument of policy is created by
cordoning off a State or a group of States. Restricted cereal grains from one
food zone cannot be moved to another except on government account or under
government license. States can control movement of grain both within and
across state borders.
4.        The primary purpose of the use of food zones is to isolate areas
of surplus production. Since farmers and grain merchants are unable to sell
legally outside the zone, the market price is driven down to the level of the
government procurement price (see para 8). If large differences exist in the
market price between food zones, black market activities and smuggling arise
to circumvent government policy.
5.        The use of food zones discourages production in currently surplus
areas and encourages production in deficit areas. Carried to an extreme,
the continued use of food zones could result in each State becoming self-



ANNEX 3
Page 2
sufficient in foodgrain production. To the degree that some areas are in
surplus due to comparative advantage, the use of food zones is detrimental
to the national welfare since it results in a continuing misallocation of
resources by encouraging production in inefficient areas. Furthermore, by
depressing the market price in surplus areas tends to encourage greater con-
sumption than would occur with higher market prices. In addition, since
domestically procured grain is sold at subsidized prices, this action tends
to encourage expanded consumption in those areas with access to public sector
grain distribution.
6.        In years when a short crop exists, food zones tend to become
smaller in order to isolate pockets of surplus production. During years
of good harvest, there is a tendency to mare food zoues larger and to permit
the private trade to play a larger role in the marketing of foodgrains. On
April 12, 1977, GOI announced the abolition of wheat food zones. That is,
there is no longer any movement restriction within India on either wheat or
vraeat products. However, roller flour mllls must continue to purchase wheat
supplies from government stocks. Whether this foreshadows a new policy
direction or simply reflects an attempt by GOI to reduce its own procurement
when large stocks are on hand and public distribution is reduced, remains to
be seen.
7.        Support Price.  The concept of a support price whereby the govern-
ment agrees to buy all grain of fair average quality offered at a fixed price
has long been recoguized by 001. The primary purpose of such a support price
is to protect farm income in years of a favorable harvest. However, in the
last 12 years, open market prices have never sunk as low as the minimum support
price. Since 1969, GOI has stopped Announcing a minimum support price before
crop planting dates and has relied upon a procurement price announced prior
to crop harvest and marketing to play a support function in addition to its
primary purpose.
8.        Procurement Price.  In order to procure domestic supplies of grain
for public distribution, GOI announces a fixed price which becomes the basis
for purchase by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) or State government in
those States where FCI is not permitted to procure directly from local farmers.
In most years the procurement price has been below the market price. The
procurement price is determined by GOI and cleared after discussions with
Chief Ministers from each State. This determination usually relies heavily
upon recommendations of the Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) discussed
in para 12.
9.        Issue Price.  This term refers to the price at which grain from
the Central Pool is issued and dispatched to a State government for conces-
sional distribution through its Fair Price Shops. Throughout this Annex,
the term issue price will be used with reference to sale from FCI to the
State governments. During the 19609 when a large proportion of public
distribution grain was imported wheat obtained on concessional terms, this
inexpensive grain Was used to help keep the issue price low. During recent



ANNEX 3
Page 3
years when imported grain has cost more than domestically procured grain,
the issue price has not reflected higher costs of imported grain.
10.       Although it is the stated intention of GOI that the public distri-
bution system be self-supporting, this has not been true since the time
imports were obtained at concessional prices. At the same time that food
zones were eliminated, the procurement price for wheat was increased from
Rs 1,050 per ton (US$120.0) to Rs 1,100 per ton (US$125.70). In the same
policy statement, the issue price for wheat was left unchanged at Rs 1,250
per ton (US$142.86). Again the question arises as to whether this fore-
shadows a new policy direction by separating the procurement and issue
prices and thereby abandoning the idea that public distribution is a 'no
profit-no loss" operation or whether this action is simply a short-run
expediency.
11.       Food Corporation of India (PCI).  This organization was established
in 1964 (see Annex 4 for details). PCI is the primary agency of GOI to
achieve its stated foodgrain policies. FCI procures foodgrains domestically
through its own agents or from the respective State governments in those
States which do not permit FCI to procure directly from farmers or grain
merchants. In addition, FCI imports foodgrains to augment domestic supplies.
Stocks held by PCI are referred to as Central Pool stocks. Issues from the
Central Pool go to State governments who turn them over to their Departments
of Civil Supply or in some cases directly to Fair Price Shops for public
distribution. FCI has the responsibility of procuring,, storing and trans-
porting to each State government foodgrains in the amount needed to effec-
tuate national policy. In addition, FCI handles sugar, oil and other commod-
ities on a modest scale (see Annex 4).
12.       Agricultural Prices Commission (APC).  This agency was established
in 1965. The APC draws up policy papers recommending procurement prices and
target quantities. When a minimum support price was utilized, APC also recom-
mended its specific value. Its price recommendations are based on cost of
production, size of harvest, probable demand, price of foodgrains relative
to competing crops, trend in open market prices and general economic condi-
tions. The APC attempts to synthesize a single All-India procurement price
for each grain based on the available economic data and consistent with GOI
policy objectives.
13.       State Departments of Civil Suppl.  Each State has a Department
of Civil Supply or an equivalent agency responsible for implementing food
policy within the State. It procures, stores and distributes foodgrains
within the State. The Department receives grain from FCI and issues it to
Fair Price Shops. In addition, the Department issues ration cards when
they are used.
14.       Fair Price Shops.  The Fair Price Shop is the final step between
the producer and the consumer in the public distribution chain. In 1975,
there were 240,210 Fair Price Shops serving a population of 469 million
potential consumers or 78% of India's population. Fair Price Shops are



ANNEX 3
Page 4
operated by private traders and cooperatives under license by the State
government.  Nearly all licensees were engaged in business -- usually
retailing -- before they started operating a Fair Price Shop.
15.       A licensed Fair Price Shop may sell ouly government issued items.
However, the license holder often has a second shop selling other items.
In areas and times when formal rationing is in effect, a Fair Price Shop
may sell only to ration cardholders. When informal rationing is in effect,
Fair Price Shops may sell to anyone who wishes to purchase. However, it
appears that such factors as the location of the Fair Price Shops, the
long queues, the limits on quantities available, and the lover quality of
publicly distributed grain act as a form of rationing with higher
income consumers going to open-market shops.
C. Government Prosrams of Procurement. Distribution and Imports
Producer Price Policy
16.       Currently, a single price is used to serve as both the procurement
price and the minimum support price. As a minimum support price, its role
is to provide a floor for producer prices in surplus years. As a procurement
price, it must be sufficient to purchase needed quantities or else the
gOvernment mwat resort to coercion or imports in order to obtain targeted
quantities. To be effective, a minimum support price needs to be announced
prior to planting. However, the procurement price is announced only shortly
before the harvest begins, reducing its effectiveness as a minimum support
price to influence farmer decision-making.
17.       Since the grain acquired through government procurement is for
the public distribution system which is intended to be a "no profit-no loss"
operation, the procurement price influences the issue price of public grain.
The policy statement by GOI of April 12, 1977, which increased the procure-
ment price for wheat from Rs 1,050 per ton to Rs 1,100 per ton while leaving
the issue price unchanged at Rs 1,250 per ton, means that the government sub-
sidy will increase by Is 50 per ton.  With public distribution of wheat ap-
proximately 8,000,000 tons per year or over 60% of the wheat marketed by
farmers, this narrowing of the margin between procurement price and issue
price means that GOI will incur an increased subsidy of Rs 400 million
(US$45.7 million) per year. It is this linkage between the issue price and
the procurement price vhich exerts a continuing downward pressure on the
procurement price. The use of food zones and producer levies enables PCI
to procure target quantities at the lowest possible procurement price.
18.       One aspect of current price policy that exacerbates storage and
handling problems for FCI is the use of a single procurement price nationvide
and during the year without seasonal adjustments. Since price is constant
throughout the year, there is no incentive for farmers or grain merchants



ANNEX 3
Page 5
to hold grain for rising seasonal prices.  Since the farmer will receive
the same price immediately after harvest as well as several months later, al-
most all grain is sold as soon as it is harvested thus greatly increasing the
demAnd for off-farm storage and handling facilities. In contrast, a price
which rose during the year to reflect storage costs would permit farmers or
grain merchants to hold grain if their storage costs were lower than those
experienced by the government and reflected in a seasonally rising procure-
ment price. Such a revised policy could result in a sharply reduced peak
in government procurement. This would mean a decreased need for storage and
handling facilities since the flow of grain would be distributed over a
longer period.
19.       Admittedly such a policy could make it more difficult to procure
targeted qijantities since it would authorize greater holdings of grain stocks
in private hands. In addition, smuggling of foodgrains across food zones (see
paras 3 to 6) might become more of a problem with larger quantities in pri-
vate hands.
20.       As shown in Table 1, wholesale prices of both rice and wheat have
more than doubled in the last ten years. Prices for these foodgrains have
risen slightly faster than the general price level for all agricultural
commodities. Table 2 shows procurement, issue and open market prices for
wheat and rice. In general, the procurement price has lagged behind but
has followed the upward trend in open market prices.
Domestic Procurement
21.       As shown in Table 3, GOI procures less than 10% of total foodgrain
production. However, this represents about one-third of the marketed surplus
since nearly 70% of foodgrains do not move through commercial channels. 1/
Domestic procurement has increased since the establishment of FCI both in
terms of total quantity and as a percent of production as shown in Table 3.
All imports and about 75% of domestic procurement is handled by FCI. As a
result, more than 80% of public distribution is channeled through FCI.
22.       As shown in Table 4, wheat and rice are the primary foodgrains
procured' domestically. Nearly all of the wheat was procured for the Central
Pool (i.e., FCI). In contrast, approximately half of the rice was procured
by and for State governments. Tables 5 and 6 show procurement by State for
wheat and rice. Procurement of both wheat and rice for the Central Pool
(i.e., FCI) comes primarily from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
and Andhra Pradesh. These five States supplied more than 95% of the grain
procured domestically for the Central Pool in 1974 and 1975.

Proiections of Procurement
23.       Two sets of procurement projections are available:  (1) FCI proj-
ections and (2) Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) projections.
The FCI projections were made assuming a GOI policy of rapid expausion in
procurement and public distribution and are given as ranges. In contrast
the ASCI estimates assume a moderate growth in procurement and public dis-
tribution. Furthermore, the ASCI projections are point estimates. Table 7
shows a comparison of these projections. Given current GOI policy, the
ASCI assumption is considered more realistic.
24.       In addition to the basic assumption concerning GOI policy on pro-
curement and public distribution, the ASCI projections are built upon a
series of assumptions and estimated relationships. Using regression analysis
which incorporated a trigonometric function to reflect weather cycles, pro-
duction was estimated. Procurement was estimated with a regression equation
that included production as an explanatory variable. Consequently, ASCI
procurement projections incorporate anticipated shortfalls in production
with reduced procurement. Procurement projections through 1986 are reported
in Table 12 where they are contrasted with projected public distribution to
determine implied import requirements.
Distribution of Foodgrains
25.       Public distribution of foodgrains has grown modestly since the
establishment of FCI in 1964 (see Table 3). Peak distribution occurred in
the short crop years of 1966 (14.1 million tons) and 1967 (13.2 million tons).
Although public distribution has been as much as 22% of total domestic pro-
duction, in recent years public distribution has varied between 10 to 12% of
domestic production. Approximately 80% of public distribution is channeled
through PCI. The remaining 20% never enters the Central Pool. It remains
within the respective States.
26.       Table 8 shows public distribution of wheat, rice and other food-
grains. Tables 9 and 10 show state-wise distribution of wheat and rice.
As shown in Table 9, Maharashtra and West Bengal are the two most important
recipients of wheat from the Central Pool. During 1974 and 1975 these two
States plus Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi accounted for more than 60%
of the wheat whilst Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal accounted for over
2/3 of the rice distributed.
Prolections of Public Distribution
27.       As with procurement, two sets of projections of public distribution
are available: FCI and ASCI projections. Again, the ASCI projections assume
a moderate expansion of the public distribution systems consistent with cur-
rent GOI policy.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
28.       Using regression analysis, the ASCI study included time trend,
availability of open market grain and whether or not the year was a pre-
election year as explanatory variables. The data indicated that during pre-
election years, public distribution increased, ceteris paribus. Using these
regression equations, public distribution was projected incorporating pro-
duction projections which reflected weather cycles and the GOI policy of
expanding public distribution in years of decreased production. Projections
of public distribution through 1986 are reported in Table 12 where they are
contrasted with projected procurement to determine implied imports.
Import of Foodgrains
29.       As shown in Table 3, imports have been used to alleviate the impact
of shortfalls in total production of foodgrains. Imports were greatest during
the shiO crop years of 1966 when imports were 10.4 million tons and 1967 when
imports were 8.7 million tons. There is considerable year to year variation in
quantity imported. It is difficult to determine any meaningful trend; however,
there does not appear to be any long term trend toward increasing imports.
In fact, comparing the ASCI projections of domestic procurement and public
distribution shown in Table 12, indicates a general reduction in wheat imports
leading to self-sufficiency by 1982-83. Projections for rice indicate that
rice imports would not exceed 0.5 million tons during the next decade.
D. Buffer Stock Operations
Objectives of a Buffer Stock
30.       As discussed in para 1, one of the coutinuing objectives of Indian
foodgrain policy is price stability for both consumers and producers. An-
other major objective is protecting low income consumers against the possi-
bility of food shortages. The primary function of a buffer stock is to help
attain both of these objectives. The basic concept is that, in years of
short production, the buffer provides a reserve to draw against until next
year's crop is available. On the other hand, in years of surplus production,
the buffer is intended to absorb and store the surplus and thereby prevent
a collapse in farm prices.
31.       In other words, the basic idea of foodgrain buffer stock is compar-
able to building a damr that will be used to provide both flood control in wet
years and irrigation water in dry years. If we are more concerned about wet
years, the dam would be kept empty to provide maximum flood control. If we
are more concerned about dry years, the dam would be kept full to provide
irrigation water when needed. In a similar manner, GOI has been more con-
cerned with the possibility of short crops than with the problems that would
ensue from food surpluses. Certainly, the experience of the last 30 years
indicates that short crops are more likely than large surpluses.



ANNEX 3
Page 8
32.       Given these objectives (i.e., to even out year to year variations in
price and quantity available), buffer stocks represent grain held in storage
for more than 12 months. In contrast, operational stocks represent inventory
carried less than 12 months in order to even out the seasonal differences
between procurement and distribution. In practice, buffer and operational
stocks are interchangeable. However, conceptually it is useful to distin-
guish between the two in order to determine storage needs.
GOI Analysis of Buffer Stock Requirements
33.       From time to time, GOI has announced the need for a buffer stock
of foodgrains to help achieve its basic food policy objectives. The most re-
cent analysis calls for a buffer stock of 12 million tons. 1/ This analysis
utilized data on production, consumption and imports for the period 1960-61
to 1975-76 to determine the buffer stock required.
34.       Figure 1 illustrates the underlying logic for the GOI analysis.
As Figure 1 shows, both demand for and production of foodgrains grow over time.
However, there is a continuing gap that is satisfied with imports. For the
period analyzed the average annual production-consumption gap was 4.625 million
tons.  Since there were variations in both production and consumption, the
standard deviation of the production-consumption gap was 4.591 million tons.
As shown in Figure 1, a bumper crop would result in self-sufficiency for that
year while a short crop would require substantial imports or the utilization of
grain reserves (i.e., buffer stocks).
35.       The analysis continued by choosing the mean plus 1 standard devia-
tion as a reasonable level of protection, the implication being that this
would provide protection for two years in three against the combination of
being unable to import plus a short crop. Since this represents a one-tailed
probability (i.e., the only concern is with short crops), the level of protec-
tion is not 68% but rather 84%.
36.       Recognizing that average production for the period analyzed was
76.1 million tons, GOI determined that the chosen buffer stock level of the
mean plus 1 standard deviation (9.2 - 4.6 * 4.6) was 12.1% of average pro-
duction. With current production of approximately 100 million tons, it was
concluded that a buffer stock of 12 million tons provided the desired pro-
tection against a short crop two out of three years.
37.       Using the same logic but correcting the probability to reflect the
one-tailed nature of the problem as illustrated in Figure 1, the 67% level of
protection requires a buffer stock equal to the mean plus 0.44 standard devia-
tions or 6.6 million tons (4.625 plus (0.44 x 4.591)). This represents 8.7%
of average production for the period analyzed and would imply a needed buffer
stock of 8.7 million tons with current levels of production. However, both

of Economics and Statistic, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi, unpub-
lished Memo. December, 1976.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
GOI analyses assume that imports will grow to approximately 6 million tons
per year and that the unavailability of imports is part of the need for the
buffer stock. Since the ASCI projections shown in Table 12 and the mission's
projections in Annex 2, Table 14 indicate that the need for imports would be
expected to decline below current levels, one of the basic assumptions of the
GOI analysis is open to criticism.
ASCI Analysis of Buffer Stock Requirements
38.       As a part of its overall study of India's grain storage require-
ments, ASCI evaluated a series of buffer stocking strategies utilizing a
computer simulator. 1/ The study combined buffer and operational stocks
into a total stock requirement. This was done in recognition of the fact
that peak storage requirements last less than three months but that some
operational stocks are held for more than three months. Operational stocks
held more than three months plus buffer stocks create the requirement for
permanent storage facilities.
39.       Several variations of the ASCI model were considered.  One variant
had as its objective function the minimization of the discounted cost of
buffer stock operations covering purchase, sale, stocking and imports over
an 11 year time horizon. The objective of the second variant was to mini-
mize price variations during the 11 year time horizon. The third version
combined these two objectives.  Further refinements included projected pro-
duction, procurement and consumption which included the impact of weather
cycles and the cost of transporting grain from surplus to deficit areas.
The ASCI study concludes that, for current levels of production and con-
sumption, total stocks (i.e., buffer plus operational stocks) should be 12
million tons.
40.       The GOI analysis requires total stocks of 16 million tons on hand
April 1 of each year (12 million ton buffer plus 4 million operational stocks).
Correcting the GOI analysis to consider the one-tailed nature of the problem
implies a total requirement of 13 million tons on hand April 1 of each year
(9 million buffer plus 4 million operational stocks). The ASCI analysis
which combines buffer and operational stocks develops a total requirement
of 12 million tons on hand on April 1 of each year. The next section of this
annex utilizes a 7 million ton buffer stock and a 4 million ton operational
stock on April 1 to illustrate projected grain flows and storage requirements.
Appropriate Size of a Buffer Stock
41.       FCI indicates that in order to operate the current public distribu-
tion system, a minimum inventory of 4 million tons is required as pipeline
stock. Given the location and transportation difficulties faced by FCI, this
appears to be a reasonable level of operational stocks. Due to the seasonal
nature of procurement and distribution these stocks are based on April 1
inventory of 1.25 million tons of wheat and a November 1 inventory of 650,000

tons of rice. Using monthly data on procurement and distribution for wheat
and rice during 1974 and 1975, monthly indexes were developed. Table 13 shows
monthly grain flow and operational stock required to operate the public dis-
tribution system of India at about the current level. The primary difference
between Table 13 and actual practice is that Table 13 assumes no imports
(i.e., public distribution is accomplished entirely with domestic procurement).
Table 13 represents a steady-state situation with neither a buildup nor a
depletion of stocks.
42.       As can be readily seen in Table 13, storage requirements for opera-
tional stocks (i.e., for intra-year variation with perfect knowledge and no
mistakes) is 7.5 million tons if storage is perfectly located and utilized
and there is perfect substitution between wheat and rice. On the other hand,
if wheat storage and rice storage are located in separate areas or otherwise
not perfectly meshed, peak storage requirements are 8.3 million tons (i.e.
the wheat peak of 6.0 million tons plus the rice peak of 2.3 million tons).
Since these figures represent operational stocks, any buffer stock - to be
held more than 12 months - adds to this storage requirement. For example,
a 7 million ton buffer would require a peak capacity between 14.5 and 15.3
million tons.
43.       During a short crop year, procurement declines and public distri-
bution increases. Such counter-cyclical action lies at the core of using
a buffer stock to attain the objectives of price stability and protecting
low income consumers. Table 14 illustrates hypothetical grain flows when
procurement is reduced and public distribution is increased such that a
7 million ton buffer stock is just exhausted. Without imports, a 7 million
ton buffer stock could be dissipated in a single bad crop year. Because wheat
and rice harvests occur at different seasons, Table 14 uses a two year hori-
zon to illustrate the depletion of a buffer stock.
44.       Table 14 starts with stocks of 11,606,000 tons of grain (i.e.,
the 4,606,000 tons of operational stocks from Table 13 plus a 7,000,000 ton
buffer). In Table 14, a short wheat crop and increased wheat distribution
are experienced from April of the first year to March of the second year.
The remaining months are identical to the steady-state figures reported in
Table 13. For rice, a short crop and increased distribution occur from
November of the first year to October of the second year. The remaining
months are identical to the steady-state figures reported in Table 13. In
this simple example, it is readily apparent that a single bad year could
result in depletion of stocks and considerable unused warehouse space.
45.       Although security is the more common objective, the concept of a
buffer stock also deals with absorbing and storing surplus production in
good years. During surplus years, more than normal would be procured while
less than normal would be distributed. Table 15 illustrates a hypothetical
year in which procurement increases to 15 million tons and distribution falls
to 9 million tons. Again a two year horizon is used for this illustration
because of the difference in wheat and rice harvest seasons. Table 15 begins

with an initial stock of 11,606,000 tons (i.e., 4,606,000 tons of operational
stock from Table 13 plus a 7,000,000 ton buffer). As a result of this hypo-
thetical bumper crop, storage requirements peak at 20 million tons.
Cost of a Buffer Stock
46.       Table 16 shows a simple comparison between holding a 12 million
ton buffer stock versus an 8 million ton buffer stock. As shown in Table 16,
a 12 million ton buffer stock requires an additional investment of Rs 5.9
billion (US$674 million). Furthermore, the cost of holding the added 4 mil-
lion tons of buffer stock is Rs 2.4 billion (US$274 million) per year. The
benefit of this additional 4 million tons of buffer stock, using the GOI
model discussed in paras 33-37, is to protect against a short crop one year
in five. (Additional detail regarding FCI financial losses are reported,,
in Annex 4, para 33).
47.       In summary, the storage requirements of the current system of public
distribution are substantial. It is reasonable to assume that a buffer stock
of not less than 7 or 8 million tons up to 12 million tons should be held.
The specific size depends upon the cost of holding, the benefits of having
foodgrain available when needed, ready availability and cost of imports and
many other factors. From the standpoint of the current storage project, an
April 1 carry over of 7 million tons buffer plus 4 million tons operational
stocks impose storage requirements beyond the currently available facilities
and planned construction.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
The Food Corporation of India
A. Background
1.        The Food Corporation of India (FCI) was established by an Act of
Parliament in 1964, and started functioning early in 1965. The primary
duties of the Corporation are to undertake the purchase, storage, movement,
transport, distribution and sale of foodgrains and other foodstuffs as an
instrument of public policy. The Corporation, with previous approval of
Government of India (GOI) may also (a) promote by such means as it thinks
fit the production of foodgrains and other foodstuffs; (b) set up, or assist
in setting up rice mills, flour mills and other undertakings for processing
foodgrains and other foodstuffs; (c) discharge such other functions as may
be prescribed or as are supplemental, incidental or consequential to any of
the functions conferred on it under the Act.
2.        FCI operates primarily to safeguard the interests of producers and
consumers. Specific objectives are to (a) ensure reasonable prices to pro-
ducers; (b) procure and acquire a sizeable portion of marketed foodgrains
on behalf of GOI for issue to State governments; (c) ensure timely releases
of stocks through the public distribution system in order to protect the in-
terests of vulnerable sections of society; (d) minimize inter-seasonal and
inter-regional price variations; and (e) build up sizeable buffer stocks
of foodgrains from internal procurement and imports.
B. Organization and Manaaement
3.        Board of Directors.  General direction and management of FCI is
vested in a Board of Directors consisting of a Chairman, three directors
representing GOI, Managing Director of the Central Warehousing Corporation
(CWC), Managing Director of FCI, and six other directors. All directors
are appointed by GOI.
4.        The Executive Committee, constituted by the Board of Directors,
is authorized by the Act to deal with any matter within the competence of
the Corporation. In March 1977, the Executive Committee consisted of: (a)
Shri R.N. Chopra, Chairman of the Board of Directors; (b) Shri A.K. Dutt,
Managing Director, FCI; (c) Shri R. Balasubrumanian, Additional Secretary,
Department of Food; (d) Shri S.R. Kaiwar; and (e) Shri P.L. Tandon.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        PCI operates under the jurisdiction of the Department of Food,
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation. Its head office (NDO) is in
New Delhi. It also maintains 4 zonal offices, 19 regional offices, 5 port
offices, 140 district offices and warehouses at 1,700 locations. It hires
about 60,000 employees on a regular basis. The NDO employs 1,700 persons
and is organized along functional lines: Purchase Division, Procurement
Division, Quality Control Division, Storage and Contracting DivisiQn,
Engineering Projects Division, Movement Division and Finance Division.
There is a similar functional structure at the zonal and regional offices
(Organization Chart, Figure 1).
6.        Zonal and regional officers are responsible for control and super-
vision of operations in all districts and depots within the area of their
jurisdictions. Port officers handle imported foodgrains and fertilizers.
They make arrangements at the port of discharge for clearance of cargo.
A list of zonal, port and regional offices is given in Table 1. District
officers are in charge of purchase operations, movement of foodgrains to
and from storage warehouses, disbursing funds, billings, collections, ac-
counting and reporting. Staff at the warehouse sites maintain quality
control over stocks, issue stocks when required, and maintain accounts of
receipts and issues.
C. Functions
7.        Procurement of Foodgrains - Procurement is performed by FCI under
different methods suiting local conditions of market shortages or surpluses,
specific cereals, etc. In certain States, the State government procures from
farmers or grain merchants and offers the grain to FCI. In other States, FCI
goes into the local market and procures. The quantities procured are shown
in Annex 3, Table 3. Some of the alternative modes of procurement are:
(a) Price Support Purchases - During the years of bumper crops,
as in 1975/76, open market prices tend to go below the
level of procurement prices. To prevent prices received
by farmers from falling below the procurement price, pur-
chases are made by public agencies;
(b)  Levy on Farmers - In this system a progressively increasing
rate of levy linked with the size of holding is enforced.
A farmer, on the basis of his landholdings is required to
sell a part of his total produce to the government agency.
This system has been used to procure paddy or rice in
times of scarcity;
(c) Levy on Millers/Traders - To overcome the operational
difficulties of producer levies, a levy on rice millers
and traders is generally imposed. Rice millers deliver
a certain proportion of their processed rice to the public
agency at the procurement price; and



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(d) Purchase under Pre-emption Rights and Requistion - The gav- -
ernment may at times use pre-emption rights in buying wheat
and other cereals in the markets but this is rarely done.
8.        Imports.  FCI is responsible for receiving and off-loading imported
grain, paying ocean freight, handling, storage, transportation and distribu-
tion to a tate government. Imports for the past 10 years are shown in
Annex 3, Table 3.
9.        HandlinR.  Certain charges are incurred at the point of procure-
ment for delivery either to the railhead or the varehouse for indigenous
grains. These include marketing commissions and fees, State government ad-
ministrative charges, purchase/sales tax, gunny cost, transportation etc.
As the bulk of procurement is made by State government and their agencies
for FCI these charges are paid to these agencies according to agreed rates.
10.       Quality Control.  Stocks received for storage are analyzed to
determine moisture content and insect infestation. Fortnightly, stocks
are re-examined to determine condition and presence of insects. Fumigation
is undertaken if stocks shov signs of infestation. Prophylactic treatment
is given to prevent cross infestation. During 1975/76, FCI had 108 labora-
tories engaged in analyzing samples. Field research has helped determine
effective fumigants. Training sessions are frequently held for the quality
control staff at all levels of organizational structure to exchange experiences
in storing grain and to dissiminate nev information.
11.       Transportation.  Foodgrains are normally transported by truck for
distances less than 150 kilometers, and by rail beyond this distance. In
recent years the annual movement of 12 to 20 million tons of foodgrains rep-
resented less than 102 of the total railwagon transportation of goods. Al-
though the percentage is small, high priority and subsidized freight rates
have been established for foodgrains (Annex 6).
12.       Storage.  Grain, mostly wheat and paddy or rice, is stored in ware-
houses and silos owned or rented by FCI. The storage function also includes
receipt in storage, stacking, inspection, preservation, building maintenance,
and other activities associated with preservation. The recent increase in
inventory has necessitated a significant increase in required storage capa-
city (see Table 2, Annex 5).
13.       Distribution and Sale.  FCI issues wheat or rice to a State govern
ment on orders from GOt and receipt of payment from the State. The respective
State governments operate the public distribution system through Pair Price
Shops, licensed and operated by retail traders in urban and rural areas.
Quantities distributed are shown in Annex 3, Table 3.
14.       Other Activities.  In addition to the purchase, storage and sale
of foodgrains, FCI is engaged in other activities as follows:



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(a) Fertilizer. FCI handles imported fertilizer. This includes
importation, storage and sale to State goveruments or their
nominees from the Central Fertilizer Pool at the pool issue
price fixed by GOI. During 1976-77 about 2 million tons
of materials were imported;
(b)  Rice Mills.  Twenty-five modern rice mills have been built
by FCI with a rated capacity of 369,000 tons. Actual pro-
duction for 1976-77 was about 229,000 tons or a utilization
rate of 62%;
(c) Solvent Extraction Plant. FCI operates one plant to produce
vegetable oil and edible grade groundnut flour. During 1975-76,
26,276 tons were processed;
(d) Maize Mill. Produced 2,631 tons maize flour during 1975-76;
(e) Milled Pulses. Produced 2,004 tons split pulses for the
army during 1975-76;
(f) Rice Bran Oil Plant. Processed 1,886 tons of the rice bran
from four FCI rice mills and produced edible oil and rice
bran extraction used for livestock feed;
(g) Balahar Production. FCI produces a highly nutritious food
ideal for pre-school children above one year. The ingre-
dients include vegetable protein, cereal grains and grams
enriched with vitamins and minerals; 32,631 tons were pro-
duced during 1975-76; and
Ch) Sugar. In certain States, FCI has the responsibility for
procurement and distribution of levy sugar. During 1976-77,
purchases were estimated at 1.4 million tons valued at
Rs 2,859 million.
This operation is expected to result in a deficit of Rs 88.7 million. Stocks
on hand on March 31, 1977 of these commodities were 177,000 tons valued at
Rs 349.7 million.
D. Financial Mana2ement
15.       FCI has a centralized financial management system based on a de-
centralized accounting system. The chart of accounts, accounting policy pro-
cedure and reporting requirements are determined by NDO staff. The Finance
Division has these administrative Sections: Budget and Cost Control, Accounts,
Finance, Internal Audit and Physical Verifications.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
16.       Budget and Cost Control.  Performance budgeting has been used since
1969. Budgets are formulated by activity and function for each responsibility
center and the actual performance is compared with the budget. Variations
are monitored and analyzed. Standard costs are established for budget pur-
poses, and standard inventory costs are used for accounting purposes. Storage
and related costs were not shown separately between CAP, bag storage and silo
storage. Under the project, it is proposed to build storage structures which
can be used for either bag or bulk. For evaluation purposes, to determine
which type of storage is the most economical, it would be helpful if storage
costs, including storage losses, were segregated by type of storage structure.
17.       Accounts.  The general ledger is maintained, using a standard
chart of accounts, at each district office. Cash receipts and disbursements
are accounted for in the distrls offices but the NDO controls the cash posi-
tion, does necessary reconcili'ion with the accounts and performs financing
functions.
18.       Inventory transfers between districts are recorded only when the
notice of arrival is received by the issuing district office. This neces-
sity of exchange of paper work sometimes delays recording of transfers and
preparation of reports.
19.       A system of prepayment has been adopted for foodgrains dispatched
by FCI to each State government.  Payment must be received by FCI before
the district manager is authorized to ship the grain. This practice has
substantially reduced receivables. Prior to the nev system State govern-
ments were billed after delivery and there was much dispute over the quantity
and quality of grain actually delivered and the quantity and quality billed.
Payment was withheld until the dispute vas resolved.  FCI operates on behalf
of GOI and in accordance with its policy directions. These operations result
in losses which are funded from the GOI annual budget.
20.       A trial balance is prepared each quarter at the district office
and forwarded to the region. Each regional office summarizes district
office reports, adds regional office transaction and sends its report to
the zonal office. Each zonal office summarizes regional transactions, adds
its own transactions and forwards the report to the NDO. The NDO sumarizes
zonal reports, adds its own transactions and prepares certain status reports
to evaluate performance.
21.       Annually, the NDO staff prepares the Balance Sheet and Profit and
Loss Statement. Details are given in Tables 2 and 3. The accounts are then
audited by independent chartered accountants. The audit and accounting re-
ports plus the annual report is submitted to the FCI Board. In 1975-76,
this process took 5-1/2 months after the close of the financial year,
March 31, 1976 and in 1976/77, it was 3 1/2 months. In prior years it has
taken up to one year. The annual report is then submitted to Parliament.
Parliamentary approval often takes three years.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
22.       Finance.  Fund requirements have increased significantly in the
past two years as inventory stocks have increased. FCI uses various means
to finance its operations:
(i) Capital: Under Section 5 of the Food Corporation Act,
1964, capital is contributed by GOI;
(ii) Loans: Loans are made available from GOI and commercial
banks. The interest rate charged is the cost of raising
money at the time of the loan plus administrative charges.
It has ranged from 6 to 12% per annum with the latest
rate at 8% from GOI for long term investments and 12%
from commercial banks for purchase of grain;
(iii) Overdraft: PCI has made arrangements with the State Bank
of India as a leader of a consortium of banks to provide
operating capital needed to maintain the foodgrain inven-
tory. Seventy-five percent of the loan value is backed
by collateral of hypothecated grain stocks and 25% is
guaranteed by GOI. A quarterly statement of forward
financing requirements is prepared and an agreed upon
overdraft limitation is set. Cash receipts and disburse-
ments from inventory operations are charged to the FCI
central credit account at the State Bank of India. FCI
pays interest at 12% per annum on the outstanding balance;
(iv) Internal Resources: This primarily represents depreciation
reserves; and
(v) Trade Credits: Trade credits are the imports received and
recorded into inventory but the corresponding payment has
not been made to GOI.
23.       During FY76 and FY77 sources and uses of funds were as follows:
Source of Funds                        Use of Funds

24.       Internal Audit and Physical Verification.  Internal audits are
performed on records at headquarters and field offices and physical verifica-
tion of inventory stocks are made during surprise checks. In addition, inde-
pendent chartered accountants audit the accounts as provided for in the Act.
A supplementary audit is also performed by the Comptroller and Auditor General
of India.
E. Training
25.       FCI operates a Central Training Institute which provides in-service
training for officers. Outside training is also provided to officers in
modern management techniques. Some of the professional staff attend meetings
of their organizations in the country. Forty officers have studied abroad
in various subjects. Quality control seminars are held for employees of this
discipline. Management meetings are held regularly to simulate plans and
review progress. Because of the decentralization of accounting activities,
it is difficult to maintain experienced and highly qualified accounting
personnel at 140 district offices. Additional in-service training would be
useful. It also would appear fruitful for FCI financial managers to review
similar financial management systems in other countries that are carrying
out national farm programs, for example, Commodity Credit Corporation in
the USA and FCI have similar purposes and operations.
F. Analysis of FCI Operations
26.       Operating Costs.  Approximately one-third of FCI's operational
cost is for freight. Another 25% to 30% is for interest on operating capi-
tal. Salaries, wages and allowances represent 15 to 20% of total expendi-
tures. Details are as follows:

28.       FCI does not have detailed operating costs for grain stored in CAP,
flat bulk or silos. However, for up to 12 months in CAP storage it is esti-
mated that Rs 380 per ton would be required for wheat and Rs 280 per ton for
paddy. Bulk handling and storage costs for up to 12 months in flat bulk
warehouses and silos were estimated at Rs 260 per ton for wheat and Rs 160 for
paddy.
Quality Control and Storaze Losses
29.       The  value of storage losses have not been included in the above
costs. Storage losses vary with moisture content and type of grain stored,
type of storage, location, length of time in storage and storage management.
Losses for 6 to 36 months storage will be the least for wheat below 12% mois-
ture stored in a silo in north India. On the other hand storage losses will
be highest when wheat, paddy or rice of over 12% moisture is held in CAP
storage in east or south India for up to 36 months.
30.       FCI quality control experts inspect each warehouse and take grain
samples to determine storage conditions each fortnight. Hand spraying and
fumigation are performed as indicated by laboratory tests. Rodent poison
procedures are maintained. However birds are not effectively controlled.
Adequate data to measure storage losses were not available. However, data
available from two States, 1971-72 through 1975-76, and based on in and out
bag count rather than weight show 1.76% loss for wheat and 3.25Z loss for
paddy stored for an average of 7 months. Information on insect damage to
grain that reduces nutritional value was not segregated. Losses can be
severe in foodgrains stored more than 8 months without adequate protection.

31.       Using available data and relying on considered opinions of experts
with extensive field experience, estimates were made of wheat and paddy stor-
age and handling losses based on cause of loss, type of storage, location
and length of storage. The results are summarized as follows (details are
given in Tables 5 and 6):
Z Loss Based on Weight of Grain Placed in Storage
(Type of Storage)
Flat
No. Months in Storage         CAP    Bas    Bulk    Silo

6 months                      3.81   8.89   0.53    0.30
12 months                     5.50   3.33   0.80    0.37
24 months                    11.38   5.09   1.37    0.77
36 months                    19.25   7.80   2.00    1.22
32.       Storage and handling losses are the least with wheat and paddy
stored in a silo or a bulk flat warehouse and the most when stored in CAP
stacks.  It is particularly important to note that for storage of more than
12 months duration, losses in conventional bag warehouses and CAP are costly.
For example, 7.0 million tons of wheat stored 24 months would have lost about
350,000 tons weight valued at Rs 420.0 million (US$48.0 million) if stored
in bags and conventional warehouses. If this wheat were stored in bulk flat
warehouses for 24 months, the storage loss would be about 96,000 tons valued
at Rs 115.0 million (US$13.0 million).
33.       Deficit Financins.  FCI as a large, national public sector business
organization exists under certain constraints that prevent its management from
operating as a profit motivated agency. First, GOI determines both domestic
procurement and issue prices for foodgrains handled by FCI and without refer-
ence to full cost recovery. Whilst this constraint is consistent with public
policy objectives, it has resulted in annual budget deficits for FCI of about
Rs 583 (US$66.63) per ton in 1976-77. Costs not recovered from consumers
were about Rs 3,000 million (US$343.00 million) in 1975-76, Rs 4,500 million
(US$512.0 million) in 1976-77 and are expected to increase to nearly Rs 5,000
million (US$571.0 milion) in 1977/78.



ANNEX 4

34.       State governments receive FCI grain freight prepaid at the issue
price, handle and store the grain and distribute it to licensed Fair Price
Shops and flour mills. They determine the retail price. Consumers eligible
for concessional priced grain are issued ration cards. In some States all
consumers in the area (the State of West Bengal, city of New Delhi, etc.)
receive ration cards; in other areas only the poorest of the urban poor
receive ration cards. In many States the rural poor do not receive ration
cards. The margin between cost of grain to the State government and its
retail price seldom covers costs for handling, storage and distribution.
For example, wheat received by Government of West Bengal costs Rs 1,250 per
ton delivered to the railway depot. GOWB charged consumers Rs 1,400 per ton
(Rs 1.40 per kg) for the wheat. However, its operating costs exceed Rs 250
per ton; i.e. it operated at a loss of over Rs 100 per ton of grain distri-
buted. Similar losses were reported by State governments in Tamil Nadu,
Maharashtra, Bihar and Kerala.
35.       Costs of these magnitudes are a function of national and State
government policies and can be reduced by: (a) removal of zones and reduction
of restrictions on interstate private trade; (b) appropriate adjustments in
procurement, issue and distribution prices; (c) reducing annual carry-over
stocks (as of April 1st) to, say, 7 to 10 million tons rather than 12 to 18
million tons; (d) restricting concessional distribution to the poorest of the
poor; and (e) reducing costs of operation for FCI and the respective State
governments. The project concentrates on item (e) by providing facilities
designed to reduce unit costs of handling, storing and transporting foodgrains.
36.       Inventory Management.  FCI's Management Information and Control
Branch (MICB) collects and analyzes information received from the 1,700 ware-
house centers and use it to assist management determine grain movements.
Data are prepared at each of the centers and collated at the district level,
regional office and zonal office for transmittal to the NDO. The MICB com-
piles the data as:
Nature of Information            Frequency           Sources
Procurement position            Daily           Regional office
Storage/issue of stocks         Weekly               "      i
Storage space position             "            Storage division
Stock position                  Fortnightly    Regional office
Survey report on food-
grain production or
consumption situation            it
37.       Fortnightly, GOI advises FCI concerning the quantity and kind of
foodgrain to be issued to each State.  FCI operational division managers meet
and with the data compiled by MICB as given above, determine grain movements
needed to fill requests. They consider location of stocks and transportation
costs, availability of railwagons by location, supply and distribution pat-
tern and quality of stocks.

38.       Timeliness and accuracy of information appears to be satisfactory
although there are delays in receiving data from the field. The problem of
movement planning also becomes more complex as volume and number of locations
involved increases and quality of grain deteriorates with longer storage
periods. A larger and larger amount of high level managerial time is re-
quired. A computerized scheduling program available in,India could help
solve FCI's inventory management problems and improve efficiency, accuracy
and timeliness of the operation.
39.       Subsidiar_y Business Operations.  As described in para 14 FCI
handles imported fertilizers and processes and distributes rice, rice bran
oil, maize, flour and dal. These subsidiary businesses all operate at a
small profit.
G. Construction and Maintenance of Storage Facilities
40.       Two engineering divisions within FCI, each under the charge of a
Managing Engineer, supervise the construction of new and maintenance of exist-
ing foodgrain storage facilities. The first division, with a staff of 787
engineers, draftsmen and financial officers, is responsible for conventional
(bag) storage structures. It also contracts with the grain storage division
of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to design warehouses, document
tenders and works contracts, and supervise construction of conventional stor-
age facilities. CNWD developed the Model A design proposed for this project
and has had extensive experience in its construction. The second division,
with a staff of 171, is responsible for the design, construction and main-
tenance of bulk flat and silo storage structures.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Foodgrain Storage Resources and Needs
A. Without the Pro1ect
1.        Total storage caDacity available with public agencies and coop-
eratives for storing foodgrains is estimated to be about 10.48 million tons
for 1975/76. The private sector is estimated to an additional 8.0 million
tons. A matrix of storage use and ownership is given in Table 1.
2.        FCI has increased its ownership of storage capacity in silos and
warehouses from 2.0 million tons transferred to it by the GOI Department of
Food in 1965-66 to 5.5 million tons in 1975/76. FCI also has about 100,000
tons of silo storage and 300,000 tons of conventional bag storage warehouses
under construction. When these are completed at the end of 1977, FCI will
have 700,000 tons of bulk storage capacity and 5.2 million tons of conventional
warehouse storage capacity. In addition it now operates hired storage space
for 5.5 million tons. Because of the shortage of varehouse space, about 7.0
million tons of foodgrains are stored out in the open under polyethylene covers
and stacked on a plinth base (CAP). Details concerning the type and location of
existing FCI storage are given in Appendix A and IBRD Map 12880.
3.        Analysis of FCI Grain Storage Capacity.  For bulk grain, static
storage capacity has been calculated on the basis of 769 kgs wheat per cubic
meter, mhus a grain storage warehouse 21 m by 125 m by 6.2 m contains
1,6275 m and has She capacity to store 12,500 tons of wheat. Paddy weighs
only 577 kgs per m ; the same building would have the capacity to store 9,375
tons of paddy.
4.        Hovever, most FCI warehouses are designed and utilized for storage
of grain in gunny bags. A warehouse with the same dimensions as above is
rated at 5,000 ton static storage capacity for wheat in bags. This capacity
is based on a stacking plan designed to hold 100 bags of 100 kgs each per
layer, 15 bags high or 150 tons per stack, and 36 stacks in the building.
Alleyways of 1.2 m by 0.75 m enable workers to fumigate, load and unload
any stack without moving other stacks. This arrangement provides for 5,400
tons wheat storage which is adjusted to 5,000 tons because the bags usually
contain slightly less than 100 kgs each and a small working space is reserved
for staff engaged in quality control and record keeping.
5.        At 15 bags stacking, a working space of 1.7 m is available above
each stack. It is possible to store additional grain by having more than
15 layers of bags in the stacks. Each layer above 15 would add 360 tons to



ANNL. 5
Page 2
capacity and reduce overhead working space by 0.25 a. It is also possible
to reduce width of the alleyways and increase storage capacity. However,.
increasing the stack height to, say 17 or 18 layers of bags requires addi-
tional wage payments to laborers to build and maintain each stack and to
fumigate.  Bags on the lover layers may also burst and spill the grain.  A
reduction in alleyway space makes it difficult to remov,e any one stack with-
out disturbing the others. This arrangement also interferes with effective
fumigation. Hence, when more than 5,000 to 5,500 tons of wheat in bags are
stored in a conventional warehouse, handling costs and grain losses increase
substantially. Therefore, PCI continues to rate these warehouses at 5,000
tons static capacity.
6.        Storage Utilization.  Currently, with 18.0 million tons of grain
in storage, FCI utilizes its own and hired conventional bag grain warehouses
at about 90% of static capacity, measured on the basis of average end-of-month
inventory. As demanded by the States or as grain goes "out of condition",
it is dispatched for immediate consumption. Grain stored under CAP is then
moved into the warehouse. FCI silos are utilized at about 98% of static
capacity, with wheat intended for long term (24 to 36 months) buffer stock
storage. However, when FCI procured and dispatched less than 10 million
tons of grain annually (1971-72 to 1974-75) its own and hired storage space
were utilized at an average annual end of month rate of 67% of static capacity
in 1970-71 and 1971-72, 54% in 1972-73, 24% in 1973-74 and 352 from 1974-75
up to April 1975-76. During these years FCI owned and hired about 7.8 to
10.5 million tons of storage capacity. Its end of month inventories varied
from 2.3 million tons to 5.4 million tons.
7.        Seasonality of Grain Storage Needs.  PCI grain storage needs peak
during the harvesting and marketing season. Storage needs for wheat are at
a peak in early July and decline monthly until the following April unless
off-set by imports. Paddy storage requirements increase from October, are
at a peak from December to February and decline monthly until the follow-
ing May-June in east and south India. Storage requirements for all grains
are usually at a peak in July and decline monthly until October or November.
Wheat and paddy are procured in north India but only paddy is procured in east
and south India.
B. With the Prolect
8.        Specific objectives of the project as proposed by GOI are:
(i)  to augment maximum possible grain storage capacity within
the available time;
(ii) to increase the bulk storage capacity; and
(iii) to make a beginning in developing an integrated system
for handling, movement and storage of foodgrains in bulk.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
To achieve these objectives the project would finance the construction.of
conventional bag storage warehouses (Model A complexes) with a total capacity
of 2.5 million tons, bulk-cum-bag warehouses (Model B, C and D complexes) with
a capacity of 1.0 million tons bulk storage and 75,000 tons of port silo
storage, adding to a total of about 3.5 million tons. Detailed specifi-
cations are given in Annex 7. Cost data are given in Annex 9. In addition,
the project would finance rural procurement centers, rail and highway trans-
port equipment to receive, handle and transport grain in bulk form (Annex 6),
training and operations research and engineering consultants.
9.        Estimates of storage requirements based on buffer stocks were
calculated by the "All-India Grain Storage and Distribution Study" group by
a special GOI committee and published in their "Report of the Technical Group
on Buffer Stocks of Foodgrains" in November 1976 and by FCI. The results for
1980-81 are summarized as:

10.       From 1980/81 onwards, public procurement and distribution of wheat
and rice is expected to be about 12.0 million tons and more (see Annex 3,
Table 12). Since its share of this activity is expected to be about 80%,
FCI would be handling 9.6 millions by 1980/81. The peak storage requirement,
occurring in June (see Annex 3, Table 13), for this 9.6 million tons would be
6.0 million tons. (Procurement would be concentrated during the harvest
months while the off-take would be more evenly distributed). At any given
peak, there would be some storage facilities that cannot be fully loaded
because they are located in pockets of poor harvest or are temporarily
inaccessible or because there is imperfect substitution between wheat and



ANNEX 5
Page 4
paddy storage. Taking these factors into account, it is estimated that at
peak, the storage facilities on average would be only 80% loaded, so that
7.5 million tons of storage capacity would be necessary to handle FCI's
projected June peak of 6.0 million tons. The above calculations assume no
year-to-year fluctuations in procurement and demand on the public distribution
system. In fact, fluctuations do occur and in such a way that procurement is
high when offtake from the public distribution system is low, resulting in
rapid stock buildup, as occurred in 1975/76 when peak stocks rose to 18.0
million tons. Rapid stock drawdown can occur when procurement is low at the
same time demand is high, and maintaining supplies to vulnerable groups then
requires larger than normal quantities of grain. GOI's policy is to build
the capacity to hold 12.0 million tons of grain in addition to those needed
for normal operations purpose; FCI's requirement would then be 18.0 million
tons.  With this project FCI would own 9.4 million tons of capacity by 1980/81.
01F FCI would continue to make use of storage space rented from other public and
private entities; but only about 2.0 million tons of the 5.5 million tons cur-
rently rented is of acceptable standard; the substandard remainder is being
hired because it is better than open, CAP storage. After 1980/81, FCI will
have access to 11.4 million tons of secure storage capacity, about 4 million
tons above that needed simply for operations in a normal year but 8.0 million
tons less than needed to fulfill GOI's buffer stocking goals. Stock accumu-
lations above 11.4 million tons will have to be accommodated in substandard
rented storage or CAP storage. After the current building program is com-
pleted, the GOI will have the opportunity to decide upou another tranche
of FCI's expansion program either reaffirming current goals for Government-
owned storage or altering these goals in response to changed policies.
11.       The proposed project components would enable FCI to replace a part
of CAP storage with conventional bag storage warehouses, shift a part of the
seasonal storage to flat bulk storage warehouses, and provide silos to
receive imported grain at 2 ports. These changes would materially reduce
storage losses and operational costs (see Annex 4, Tables 5 and 6).
12.       Criteria used for selecting locations and type of storage are
given in Appendix B. Locations, type and capacity of storage structures
proposed for the project are attached as Appendices C and D.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Criteria Used for Site Selection and Type of Storage
A. Warehouses
1.        The following factors have been considered in selecting each loca-
tion (town) and site (specific plot of land) and type of structure (bag or
bulk) for each warehouse storage complex:
(a) Local supply and demand situation and existing and projected
procurement and/or distribution for each type of grain;
(b) Type, capacity and location of existing grain storage (FCI
and others) relative to existing and projected procurement
in and near the proposed site;
(c) Transportation resources serving the locale including road
and rail network, and feasibility of a railway siding to the
site (a railway siding would be included in each project
complex); and
(d) Storage and distribution strategies and logistics such as
probably moisture content of grain to be procured locally,
probable proportion to be procured in bag and bulk, prob-
able length of storage, probable direction and distance of
flow to intermediate and consumer storage and issue centers,
and transportation resources to be used.
2.        Guidelines for site selection and type of warehouse have included:
(a) storage of operations and buffer stocks of wheat in and near procurement
towns; (b) need for aeration facilities to dry grain and keep it in good con-
dition; and (c) use of Models B, C and D for storage of wheat or paddy in bulk
for 12 to 36 months, or (d) use of the Model A warehouses where paddy and rice
do not need drying and for bag handling and storage.

B. Port Silos
3.        Each silo unit would be located adjacent to a dock where ships
carrying grain can be received and unloaded. Dock sites and facilities
should be capable of receiving and off-loading ships of at least 20,000 ton
capacity directly into the silo bulk grain conveying system. Docks are
selected where annual receipts of more than 300,000 tons of imported grain
would be expected for a silo with 25,000 tons storage capacity and more
than 600,000 tons receipts for a silo with 50,000 tons storage capacity.
A railway siding would be included in each complex.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Resources for Transporting Foodtrains
1.        Transportation is FCI's largest category of operating cost, account-
ing for one third of such costs. Over 70% of FCI's domestic wheat and rice
shipments originate in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and are moved
by rail toward N. Delhi, Patna, Calcutta and Bombay. Imported grains, mostly
wheat, are received in bulk at Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Vizag, Khandla and
other ports. They are bagged and moved by trucks to warehouses in or near the
port city or by rail if dispatched up country. At some warehouses, the bags
are emptied and the grain is stored in bulk. Details are given in Table 1.
2.        Indian Railways (IR) operate more than 60,000 route-kms of railvway
lines throughout India (See IBRD Map 12880). More than 7,000 locomotives are
used to pull 19,000 passenger coaches and 290,000 railwagons. Unit trains
loaded with only one comuodity move most of the bulky goods such as foodgrains,
fertilizers, iron ore and coal. More than Rs 52.0 billion (US$6.0 billion) is
invested in the system that provides employment for 1.7 sillion people.
3.        Since 1965-66, IR has transported 200.0 to 250.0 million tons of
freight per year. FCI has moved 7 to 15 million tons of foodgrains with IR
each year. The typical unit train locomotive pulls about 75 4-wheeler wagons
or about 35 bogie (8-wheeler) wagons filled with wheat or rice in bags. The
design of the hook coupling of 4 wheeler wagons, and siding length limits
the gross train load to about 2,500 tons. The bogie wagons which are fitted
with central buffer couplers can, however, be handled in trains with gross
loads of 45 tons. It requires 6 to 8 days for a unit train to load and deliver
grain 100 km. The wagons which are common purpose are diverted for other
traffic after unloading. The current rail-tariff rates on grain transport
are the same for private and public agencies. These rates, estimated at about
70% of cost, are subsidized.
4.        IR and FCI at present have limited experience in railwagon move-
ment of wheat in bulk form. Changes required to make rail transport in bulk
rather than in bag technically and economically feasible include:
Alternative A. Use of a grain retention door on existing modified
bogie (8 wheeler) railwagons. The grain door is made from rein-
forced corrugated paper. It is used for one trip and discarded.
The door jamb on the existing railwagon would need a wooden strip
or special hooks added to hold the supplementary door. The
modifications to a bogie (8 wheeler) wagon having 4 doors would



ANNEX 6
Page 2
cost about Rs 5,000 per wagon.  The paper door costs about
Rs 96. The use of paper doors on modified existing wagons
would enable bulk transportation of grain to reduce handling
cost and enable a unit train operation on a round trip basis.
Alternative B. Replace the existing bogie wagon (8 wheeler)
with a specially designed grain wagon. This special type of
railwagon is used extensively in western Europe, Canada and USA.
A special car of 80 ton capacity would cost about Rs 350,000
(US$40,000). These wagons can also be used for other types of
bulky and free flowing goods if properly cleaned before loading
with grain.
5.        Truck Transportation.  FCI hires commercial truckers to move grain
procured from grain dealers in the Regulated Market Yard, from the farmer's
threshing floor, from a rice mill to a nearby warehouse and from the ware-
house to the railway station. Occasionally the grain will be moved by trucks
from the storage warehouses to issue market warehouses or flour mills for
distances of up to about 150 kms. Trucks are used to move imported grain
from portside to nearby warehouses. In all cases the grain is carried in
bags, usually 100 kg each in weight and 5 to 6 tons per truck. On arrival
for storage in bulk warehouses or silos, the bags are opened and dumped.
Transport changes vary with distance, road conditions and quantity to be
hauled and range from Rs 10.0 per ton for up to 10 kms to Rs 30.0 per ton
for 100 kms.
6.        Bulk Grain Handling and Transportation.  FCI has experimented
with receiving and transporting wheat or paddy in bulk. Conclusions reached
indicate reduction in costs when equipment and procedures for certain critical
factors are provided including (a) bulk weighing equipment at the regulated
grain market; (b) grain tight truck bodies; (c) improved mobility of trucks
in the market yard; (d) equipment such as mobile augurs or elevators to load
grain into the truck; and (e) availability of truck lifting and bulk grain
receiving equipment at the receiving warehouse, silo, flour mill or rice
mill. More than 90% of the wheat and paddy received in North Indian markets
(over 75% of FCI receipts of domestic grain) are delivered in bulk form by
the farmer in a tractor trolley or truck to the market yard. Providing
the needed equipment at the market yard or by-passing the market yard
with direct delivery by farmers to the FCI warehouse where scales and
unloading equipment are installed would be likely to reduce FCI operating
costs.
7.        At this time, FCI owns (including ongoing construction) bulk grain
warehouses and silos with a storage capacity exceeding 500,000 tons at 15
locations. The project would add another 1.0 million tons bulk grain storage
warehouses and silos at about 25 locations, and would also provide equipments
and facilities for receiving, handling and transporting grain in bulk form.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Description and Specifications for Grain Storage Warehouses
and Model Complexes
A. General
1.        Description and specification are given for several model storage
complexes for the storage of wheat and paddy under Indian conditions. These
are:
(a)  Model A Warehouse Complex Layout for Bag Storage (Fig 1);
(b)  Model B Bulk cum Bag Warehouse Complex Layout (Fig. 2);
(c)  Model C Circular Bin Complex (Fig. 3);
(d)  Model D Hopper Bottom Bulk Warehouse Complex (Fig. 4); and
(e)  Port silos for handling imported grain.
2.        The technical specifications outlined in this Annex serve only
to provide basic requirements. It would be essential that detailed designs
and specifications are drawn up for each site. Since FCI has a limited en-
gineering staff and limited experience in the construction of warehouses
and silos for bulk grain storage, consultants of proven proficiency in this
field would assist FCI's Project Implementation Section and Technical En-
gineering Department.
3.        Proposed site locations are shown in Annex 5 and on IBRD map 12880.
As soon as specific sites are selected and title to them acquired, complete
surveys would be needed to delineate exact boundaries and topographical
features. General soil conditions at each site would be investigated by a
competent soils engineer to determine the best foundation and floor design.
Preliminary indications are that piles would be required at most silo loca-
tions. If soil investigation for any particular site indicate unusual con-
ditions or an undue lack of uniformity, additional surveys would be made of
the areas within the site boundaries on which the structures could be built.
5.        Before inviting tenders, it would be necessary to draw up separate
prequalifications for prospective bidders for warehouse and silo construction.
Tender documents would be prepared by the FCI Technical Engineering Depart-
ment, assisted by consultants. Tenders would define in detail the work



ANNEX 7
Page 2
to be executed and would serve as a basis for preparation of working drawings
by the successful tenderer.
6.        Tenders received from prequalified contractors would be evaluated
by the technical staff of FCI, with the assistance of the consultants, to
determine conformity with tender invitations. Successf,ul tenders would be
awarded construction contracts in conformity with official procedures.
7.        Supervision of construction and equipment installation of all units
to assure conformity with all tender requirements would be provided by FCI
assisted by the engineering consultants.
B. Specifications for Motel.A Warehouse Complex (Fig 1)
(50,000 tons Bag Storage)
8.        General.  The layout of the complex and construction of warehouses
are based upon receipt and issue of grain in bags by bullock cart, tractor
trailer, truck and railway wagon. The dimensions for each warehouse are
21.8 m by 127.6 m by 6.35 m. Each warehouse would be divided by solid par-
titions into three equal compartments. The rated capacity for wheat per
building is 5,000 tons when the bags are stacked 15 layers high. A typical
arrangement of ten warehouses with a total storage capacity of 50,000 tons
is shown in Fig. 1. Detailed costs are given in Annex 9, Table 2.
Construction Details
9.   (a)  Footings for the walls and platform are of plain concrete (1:5:10
mix) with a thickness of 23 cm. The width and depth of the footings below
grade is to be in accordance with Drawing No. FCI/FGG/CP VII/2. (b) The
footings for the columns would be, of reinforced concrete (1:2:4 mix) with
dimensions and reinforcing bars for each type of column in accordance with
the drawing referred to above. The columns, bands, beams, lintels and other
reinforced concrete building components would also be in accord with the
same drawing. (c) All floors including those for the platforms would be of
plain concrete 18 cm (8 in) thick (1:2:4 mix) poured in one course over a
well compacted fill. A moisture barrier in the form of a polyethylene plas-
tic 1.5 mm thick would be placed over the fill to prevent moisture transfer
through the concrete in vapor form from the damp fill underneath. The height
of the top of the floor would be 75 cm (about 30 in) above grade. Control
joints would be constructed in the floors at columns as shown in Fig. 1. See
references on concrete floor construction. 1/ (d) A continuous platform 3
meters wide would be constructed on the railway side of the warehouse. Indi-
vidual platforms would be built on the roadside in front of each door opening.

(e)  Wall panels between the reinforced columns and in the gable part of
the end walls and partitions would be of conventional brick construction.
A cement plaster 12 mm thick would be applied to each side of the wall.
Two coats of a suitable masoury paint would be applied to the outside wall.
(f) Shop fabricated steel tubular trusses giving an unobstructed floor space
within the warehouse would be used for supporting the roof. Cement asbestos
corrugated sheets (7 mm thick) would be used for roofing. (g) Manually oper-
ated doors of the rolling shutter type would be provided for each door. Suit-
able sliding screen doors would be provided to retard the entry of birds
and rodents. (h) Suitable vall ventilators and screened windows would be
supplied in each side wall panel between columns, as shown in the drawing
referred to in (a) above.
C. Specifications for Model B Warehouse Complex (Fig. 2)
(50,000 ton bulk grain storage, 20,000 ton bag storage)
General
10.       A complex of four warehouses of the same dimensions as in Model A
would be arranged as shown in Fig. 2. When used for bag storage the rated
capacity would be 20,000 tons. When used for bulk storage the rated capacity
would be 50,000 tons. The walls would be of reinforced concrete to carry the
load imposed by bulk grain. Ventilators and windows would be omitted but doors
are provided. In addition the floor would be constructed to support the added
weight of bulk grain. Additional facilities include five work bins, an office
building, weighbridge, railway siding and roads. Electric service for lighting
and power, together with water and sanitary facilities would be provided.
Detailed costs are given in Annex 9, Table 3.
Construction Detail
11.       Building dimensions are the same as for Model A:  21.8 m by 127.6 m
by 6.35 m. The walls, columns, footings and tunnel would be of reinforced
concrete of such design as to resist the loads imposed by bulk grain.
12.       The top ends of the columns in the end walls and partitions are
tied to columns in the side walls by tie rods as shown on the floor plan in
Fig. 2. (a) The floor would be of plain concrete 23 cm thick (9 in) placed
on a well 2ompacted fll2 adequate for supporting a distributed load of
4,900 kg/M (1,000 lb/ft ). 1/ Adequate reinforcement would be provided in

the walls, footings and ceiling of the tunnel. A 1.5 mm (6 mil) polyethy-
lene plastic would be placed between the compacted fill and the concrete
to prevent moisture transfer through the floor. Control joints are to be
provided as shown in Pig 2.   (b) Shop fabricated tubular trusses for sup-
porting the roof and to provide unobstructed space within the warehouse would
be provided. Corrugated asbestos cement sheets (7 mm thick) would serve as
the roofing. (c) Two aeration ducts 610 cm wide (277), one on each side of
the tunnel would be constructed in the floor of each compartment midway bet-
ween the tunnel and the side wall. These would run nearly the full length
of the compartment to within 1 meter of the wall or partition. These are
counected to the tunnel by an underfloor duct 61.0 cm x 91.5 cm (2 x 3 ft)
as shown in Fig. 2. The depth or height of the aeration duct is the same
as the air supply duct, but may taper to a depth of only about 10 cm at the
outer end. The aeration duct would be provided with a specially fabricated
cover which would permit air flow throughbit and which would support the
distributed and concentrated floor loads mentioned above. Steel bars 0.5 cm
x 6.35 cm s 91.5 cm (3/16 x 2-1/2 x 36") spaced 7.5 cm (3 in) apart would be
welded together with 2 rows of 2 cm diameter spaces pipe between the bars.
A 3 x 25.4 mm bar (1/8 x 1 in) welded across each end of the bars forms a
steel frame 90 cm x 250 cm (3 x 8 ft). To the top side of this framework
a 1.33 mm (18 Ga) galvanized steel sheet with 2.5 mm diameter perforations
would be spot welded. The uniformly distributed perforations provide a total
net opening of 20% to 25% of the gross area. The assembly is placed in the
recess on each side of the aeration duct to make it flush with the floor sur-
face. (d) An aeration and access tunnel would be constructed under the center
for the full length of each warehouse. Although not needed when the ware-
houses are used for bag storage, the tunnels would house the belt conveyors
and serve as air supply ducts for aeration when warehouses are used for stor-
ing grain in bulk. The tunnels are interconnected between the two warehouses
permitting two fans to be used for aerating the grain in either warehouse.
(e) Partitions would be of reinforced concrete construction. A door opening
would be provided in the center bay for movement of trucks and self-propelled
screw conveyors. For bulk storage partitions would be optional. (f) Suitable
bulkheads would be provided for all doors when the warehouses are used for
bulk storage. They are optional for the door opening in the partition,
unless the lots of grains in adjacent compartments are to be kept separate.
(g) A coutinuous platform would be constructed on the railway side of the
warehouse. A single platform at each door on the roadside of the warehouse
would be constructed. (h) Openings at the eaves and ventilators in the
ridge of the roof would be installed to provide overspace ventilation vhen
warehouses are used for bulk storage. Both the openings and ventilators
would be needed when the aeration fans are operated for cooling or for
drying in storage. The aeration system may also be used for ventilating the
warehouse when used for bag storage. All openings and ventilators would be
screened to exclude birds and rodents.
13.       Work bins (2,500 tons capacity) constructed of RCC or steel would
be used to bag grain for dispatch by truck or rail. A grain cleaner would
be optional and could be installed later.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
14.       Equipment.  Belt conveyors are to be installed for conveying grain
into and out of storage. Each of these is stationary with the exception of
those used for loading the warehouses which would be of the shuttle type with
a reversible belt. The shuttle conveyor is slightly longer than the length of
one warehouse.  Its supporting frame would be mounted on suitable rollers so
that it can be positioned to discharge the grain off the end of the belt at any
point in either warehouse. The reversible belt would be powered and loaded at
a convenient point between the two warehouses where a dead weight also would
maintain the required belt tension at all times. Each belt unloading grain
from the tunnel must discharge through a suitable spout through the tunnel the
wall and into the cross conveyor. The spout is provided with an air gate which
would be closed to make the tunnel air-tight while operating the aeration
system. In addition the conveyor from the dump pit must be enclosed in an air
tight housing where it passes through the tunneX to maintain air tightness of
the tunnel. Two bucket elevators are required'to elevate grain either of the
two surge bins for loading into railwagons or to -ither shuttle conveyor for
loading the warehouse. Suitable 2-way valves operated from floor level control
the direction of flow. Crossbracing of the elevator legs, and guy wires
sufficient to resist wind loads would be supplied. A suitable ladder and
platform for servicing the elevator head would be i stalled with each elevator.
Four 15-hp fans are required, each to supply 680 m /min (24,000 CFM) against
a static pressure of not less than 4.5 smm Hg (2.5 inches in water). One fan
would provide an air flow rate of 0.156 m /min ton (0.15 CFM/bu) to a fully
loaded compartment. A suitable temperature monitoring system would be in-
stalled to permit reading the grain temperature at each of 80 locations in the
grain bulk in each warehouse. Copper construction thermocouples would be used
as sensing devices. These would be located at two depths: one-half at a depth
of about one meter above the floor and the other a similar distance below the
grain surface. A set of two couples (bottom and top) would be located at every
other roof truss at a distance of 5.8 m (18 feet) from the side walls, and one
at alternate roof trusses in the center of the warehouse. Two 23 cm (9 inch)
open screw conveyors would be provided for each warehouse for spreading the
grain as the warehouse is being loaded and for reclaiming it during unloading.
Each conveyor would move the grain away from the center of the building where
it is being discharged by the shuttle conveyor. It would be suspended from
the roof truss and would move on rollers by a suitable drive. When loading
the conveyor would be in the up position. When unloading grain into the center
tunnel it would be lowered by a suitable winch and disconnected entirely for
maximum mobility.
D.   Specifications for Model C Circular Bins (Figure 3)
(50,000 tons bulk grain storage; 2,500 tons work bins)
General
15.       A complex of 12 circular bins would be constructed either as illus-
trated in figure 3 or according to an alternative layout plan of 3 bins on
each side of a central junction tower, rail siding and work bins. Additional
facilities would include an office building, weighbridge, rail siding, dump



ANNEX 7
Page 6
pits for receiving grain by rail or truck, work bins and roads. Electric
service for lighting and power, together with water and sanitary facilities
would be provided.
Construction Detail
16.       Each circular bin would be of 20 m inside-diameter with a wall
height of 20 m and a dome height of 23 m. Foundations, floors, tunnels, walls
and roof would be of reinforced concrete of such design as to resist loads
imposed by bulk grain under varying soil, wind and earthquake conditions at
each site. Slip forms would be used to pour the circular concrete bins.
Aeration ducts would be provided in the flat-bottomed floor with a specially
fabricated cover as explained in paragraph 12 above. Consultants would assist
FCI in designing these bins and would supervise construction.
Equipment
17.       A belt conveyor at the top and connecting each circular bin would
deliver grain into storage. A connecting tunnel and belt conveyor below
each bin would be used to reclaim the grain. Bucket elevators would lift
the grain for delivery to the top side belt conveyor or to railwagons or
trucks (for bulk dispatch) or to the work bins (for bagging and dispatch).
A suitable temperature monitoring system would be installed to permit the
reading of grain temperatures at not less than 6 locations in each circular
bin. Copper construction thermocouples would serve as sensing devices and
would be located at two depths: one-half at about one meter above the floor
and one half at the top about one meter below the grain surface. An open
screw conveyor would be suspended in each bin for spreading the grain as
it is loaded and for reclaiming it during unloading. (To reduce investment
cost this conveyor may be replaced by a labor intensive system of loading
and unloading in those bins used for long term storage.) The railwagon
scales should be considered as optional equipment, and installed only where
the annual turnover is large and where it is essential to weigh grain handled
in bulk.
E. Specifications for Model D - Hopper Bottom Flat Bulk Warehouses
(figure 4)
General
18.       This model, equipped to receive and dispatch grain in bulk or bag
from railwagon, truck or bullock cart transport, would store the grain in
bulk form. As in the other models, facilities would include belt conveyors,
bucket elevators, rail and truck dump pits, work bins, bagging and stitching
equipment, weighbridge, railway siding, roads, and water and sanitary services.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
Construction Detail
19.       The warehouse may follow the layout plan as given in figure 4 or,
alternatively, be arranged in four separate warehouses around a central
junction tower and work bins adjacent to the railway siding. Construction
is of reinforced concrete designed to carry the grain load factor adjusted
for soil conditions at each site. The hopper bottom, sloped to be entirely
self-cleaning, would be placed below ground level. Width, height of the wall
and length of the warehouse in either one, two or four structures would be ad-
justed to provide 50,000 tons of wheat storage capacity. Consultants would
assist FCI in designing these warehouses and would supervise construction.
Equipment
20.       With a self-cleaning hopper bottom and high roof line, Model D
does not need the tunnel and internal grain reclaiming system provided for
Models B and C. Temperature monitoring devices and an aeration system would
be provided. Belt conveyors, top and bottom, bucket elevators, work bins
and bag-stitching machines would be installed. Railwagon scales are optional.
A grain cleaning system could be installed later. Throughput capacity for
the conveying equipment would be determined in collaboration with the con-
sultant.
F. Specifications for Port Silos
General
21.       For silo design, it is assumed that grain, mostly wheat, would be
received in bulk from boats of 20,000 tons to 40,000 tons capacity. Most
dispatches would be in bulk form by railwagon or truck. However, bagging
facilities would be needed to facilitate local direct dispatches. Railway
siding adequate to handle a unit train would be provided.
Construction Detail
22.       Silos would be constructed in a 50,000 ton unit at Haldia, West
Bengal and a 25,000 ton unit at Madras, Tamil Nadu.  Each unit would be
located adjacent to the dockside where grain-laden ships are moored for
off-loading. Based on soil-bearing conditions at site, bins would be de-
signed with a diameter and height to provide approximately 2,000 tons of
wheat storage space each. Interstitial spaces would be utilized as work-
bins and for storage by constructing an overhead cover and connecting walls.
Hopper type bottoms should be included in each interstice (to save on re-
claiming equipment) and would be optional for the silo bins.
23.       Cost estimates have been based on the assumption that the foundation
would be a slab supported by piles. Silos would be constructed of reinforced



ANNEX 7
Page 8
concrete using the slip form method. The roof would be of reinforced con-
crete adequately supported to carry the loads imposed by the equipment located
in the gallery. The silo gallery would be a lightweight steel-framed and
covered structure. The headhouse with small work bins would be designed
and located to receive grain discharged from the ship and convey it into the
silo bins. A stairway and elevator would connect the foundation floor of
the headhouse to the silo gallery. Bulk dispatch spouting would be provided
from the headhouse to load railwagons and trucks.  Bagging platforms would
be provided on both sides of the silos and the headhouse.
Equipment
24.       Each installation would be designed and equipped to unload for
storage from the ship at the rate of 500 tons per hour. The system would be
designed to discharge grain in bulk or bag by railwagon or truck at the rate
of 250 tons per hour. Facilities for cleaning, aeration, fumigation, temper-
ature monitoring and bagging would be provided.
G. Relative Merits of Each Type of Model Warehouse Complex
25.       Model A would be constructed for storage complexes where wheat,
paddy or rice would be received and stored in bags for less than 12 months
and dispatched in bags. (See relative storage losses by type, location
and time in storage in Annex 4, Tables 5 and 6). Model A does not have an
aeration system, grain cannot be dried in storage, bird loss cannot be con-
trolled.
26.       Model B was designed to be used for bulk or bag storage, and would
be located primarily in procurement areas. It can dry bulk stored grain (by
aeration in situ) from 15% or 16% moisture down to 12% or 13%. Portable
handling equipment would receive and dispatch grain in bulk or bag by truck.
The model is recommended for those locations where large volumes of grain
are received at primary market in bulk or bag by truck and dispatched in
bulk or bag form by rail or truck after a short time in storage although
it can also be used for long term storage.
27.       Model C was designed for bulk storage in locations where ground-
water conditions create difficulties in constructing water tight tunnels
and dump pits. In such cases the underground tunnel and belt reclaim con-
veyor can be replaced with the bottom of the circular bin set well above
ground level, using an evacuator to reclaim the grain.
28.       Model D was designed to receive and dispatch grain in bulk or bag
by rail or truck, but will store only in bulk. It would be situated in those
locations where large volumes of bulk grain will be received and dispatched
and where grain is to be stored for 12 to 36 months.



ANNEX 7

H. Rural Grain Procurement Centers
29.       Grain procurement centers are to be established at each of several
procurement markets in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil
Nadu and with all the facilities required for mechanical handling of the
procured grain, including temporary storage in some cases. The grain would be
transferred in bulk from the market yard to the center by truck or it may be
delivered directly by the farmer with his tractor trailer, bullock cart, or
truck. In both cases, the grain is sampled, weighed, dumped and conveyed into
elevated steel hopper bins where it is kept until transported by truck to a
larger FCI warehouse complex for storage or for shipment by rail to points of
distribution. The grain may also be cleaned as part of the operations.
30.       Two large and four small procurement-centers are to be established,
the principal difference being the rate of handling and the total amount which
can be stored at one time. Estimated costs and equipment components for both
sizes are given in Annex 9, Table 7.
LarRe Centers (2)
31.       A storage capacity of 3,000 tons for bulk grain would be provided
by ten 300 ton steel hopper bins. The required capacity of handling would be
determined by the frequency with which loads of grain are dumped. Assuming
that each truck dump will handle ten 5-ton loads per hour, conveying capacity
would be 200 tons per hour. Therefore, the capacity of each of the two belt
conveyors from the truck dumps to the elevator legs would be 100 tons per
hour and each of the four elevators 50 tons per hour. Each of the two belts
serving the storage bins also need to be of 100-ton-per-hour capacity.
32.       If cleaning is required, the grain from one elevator would be run
through the cleaner at a rate of 50 tons per hour, the cleaned grain being
fed into a second elevator for conveying to the storage bins. The cleanings
would either discharge into a truck or into a small hopper bin adapted for
loading out into a truck. Two cleaners may be needed, depending on the
amount of grain to be cleaned, but the handling capacity would be reduced
to one-half or 100 tons per hour.
33.       An optional 1,000-ton warehouse could provide for storing and hand-
ling bagged grain and fertilizer.
Small Centers (4)
34.       The storage capacity of a small center would be 500 tons, provided
by five 100-ton hopper bins and with a handling rate only one-half that of
the large center. The arrangement for cleaning would be the same. A 500-ton
warehouse could provide for bag storage.

Other Equipment
35.       The project also would finance about 50 portable surge bins (1 to
10 ton capacity) with portable weighing scales and loading elevators, 50
sweep conveyors to load trucks and 50 sets of laboratory equipment. These
items would be placed in 10 to 20 rural Regulated Market Yards where wheat
and paddy are procured by FCI and transported to its warehouse complexes for
storage and on-shipment.

Prolect Organization and Management
A. General
1.       'The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation would have overall res-
ponsibility for organization and management of the project.  The Secretary
for Food and the Central Storage Committee (CSC) of the Ministry would be
responsible for achieving coordination of actions among the various component
agencies within GOI and between GOI and the respective State governments.
Members of CSC include the Additional Secretary for Food Chairman of FCI,
Chairman of Central Warehousing Corporation and representatives from the
Finance Ministry, Railway Ministry and Planning Commission.  FCI would be
responsible for implementing the project.
B. Prolect Implementation Division
2.        A Project Implementation Division (PID) within FCI would be respon-
sible for project execution under the direction of its chairman and the Central
Storage Committee (CSC). The two engineering sections now operating in FCI
(Annex 4, para 40) together with a new section, would make up PID which would
be placed in the charge of a chief engineer with 10 years or more experience
in the design and construction of grain storage facilities. The PID therefore,
would have three sections: the first would be responsible for the construction
of Model A conventional warehouses; the second for the construction of the
Models B, C and D bulk warehouses and port silos; and the third for finance
and administration. The heads of each section would have the equivalent of
Masters Degree in their professions and a minimum of 5 to 12 years experience.
FCI's current staff of about 850 engineers and draftsmen would go up to about
1,500 and there would be an increase of about 150 officers with training in
administration and accounting. Details of the existing and proposed pattern
and qualifications for staffing are given in Appendix A.
3.        The Conventional Storage Section would be constructing 2.5 mil-
lion tons of bag storage at 119 sites. It would engage the engineering
services of the Central Warehouse Corporation (CWC) and the Central Public
Works Department (CPWD) to execute a part of their construction program.
Both CWC and CPWD currently perform site studies, prepare and execute tender
documents and contracts, and supervise construction work on behalf of FCI,
mostly on a "turn key" basis.  They would continue to perform these functions
with the project under the supervision of the Conventional Storage Section.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
CWC would concentrate its work on about 500,000 tons of storage capacity at
about 25 construction sites in Rajasthan, Orissa, the eastern part of Andhra
Pradesh, and one or two selected locations in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. CPWD would also supervise construction of
over 500,000 tons at about 20 sites in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh
and Punjab.  The Conventional Storage Section itself would be directly in
charge of constructing the remaining 1.5 million tons at 74 sites in 10 states.
4.        The Bulk Storage Section, assisted by domestic and expatriate
consultants, would evaluate sites, prepare building designs and layout plans,
determine specifications, prepare tender documents, evaluate bids and super-
vise construction of the 1.0 million tons of bulk storage and port silos.
It would also be responsible for the construction of the rural grain procure-
ment centers.
5.        The Finance and Administration Section would be responsible for
maintaining detailed accounts of all project fund commitments and expendi-
tures, separate from FCI's other activities. It would also maintain separate
project personnel registrars and contract documentation, engage in land
acquisition, and execute all contract documents required for the project.
This Section would be responsible for preparing monthly, quarterly and annual
reports of project activities. These reports would be provided to the Chief
Executive Officer, FCI management, CSC and IDA.
6.        The Chief Executive Engineer would supervise the overall imple-
mentation of the project (including the operations research and training
programs) and the monitoring of its progress.
7.        Transport Equipment.  The project provides FCI with especially
designed trucks and funds for rehabilitation of existing private trucks hired
to transport bulk grain (Annex 9, Table 8). The project also provides hopper
bottom railwagons, enough for I unit train; and paper grain retention doors,
enough for 12 unit trains, for 3 years operations. FCI would store the grain
retention doors at the silos and bulk warehouses for installation in rail-
wagons used to transport grain in bulk. The Railways would operate one unit
train with about 45 special railwagons and 12 unit trains with paper retention
doors to transport about 500,000 tons of grain in bulk each year for FCI.
8.        Designs Development and Operations Research.  The project would
provide Rs 3.9 million (US$457,000) for FCI to develop designs for special
railway wagons and modification to existing railway wagons, and conduct
operations research studies to ascertain comparative costs of receiving,
handling, storing and transporting grain in bag and bulk. These studies
will review relative costs and benefits of the different classes of ware-
houses - Model A, B, C and D warehouse complexes as well as CAP storage -



ANNEX 8
Page 3
when used in different centers 1/ and for varying periods of storage. Simi-
larly, alternative transport facilities and usage would be evaluated. Bag-
transport would be compared with bulk transport using conventional trucks,
special grain trucks, paper grain retention doors on railwagons and hopper-
bottom grain wagons.  Such studies are being financed to obtain much more
detailed information concerning the costs and benefits o,f the system of bulk
handling, storage and transportation of grain (which would be provided under
the project as a pilot scheme), as compared to existing bag system, in order
that the use of existing storage facilities may be optimized, and the planning
and design of future storage projects be made more effective. Assurance would
be sought from GOI that plans acceptable to IDA would be prepared for carrying
out such operations research studies.
9.        Training.  FCI operates its own training program on administration
and quality control and also uses other agencies for in-service training of its
staff. The project would increase substantially the need for additional staff
trained in grain procurement, handling, transport, storage, drying and quality
control, as well as in accounting and management. The project would therefore
provide Rs 3.5 million (US$400,000) to finance (a) the expansion of FCI's cur-
rent training program, including provision of more adequate training facili-
ties; and (b) overseas travel and study tours for about staff members. The
overseas training program would concentrate on the training of experts in
bulk grain handling, storage, transport and quality control and would train
staff members for posting to the new bulk grain storage warehouses and port
silos. These staff members would also participate as teachers in local train-
ing programs at the All-India Grain Storage Training Institute at Hapur. The
Chairman or Managing Director would designate an especially qualified training
officer to be responsible for planning and organizing both the domestic and
overseas training program. PCI would prepare terms of reference for the
training program for IDA's review and comment.
C. Procurement
10.       All procurement would be in accordance with the World Bank guide-
lines. In all international competitive bidding, domestic bidders would be
given a 7-1/2% preference on civil works, and a 15Z preference on equipments,
based on the c.i.f. price of each item or the actual tariff applicable,
whichever is lower.
11.       Civil Works.  FCI would prequalify all domestic and foreign bidders
for civil works. On that part of bag (Model A) construction program begun by
GOI and proposed for inclusion under the project and in part for retroactive
financing, presentation of tender documentation for civil works is already in
progress at several of the sites and contract awards are expected to be com-
pleted by Board presentation. For the other sites, since construction would
be scattered, the value of ecah contract relatively small (most are expected
1/



ANNEX 8
Page 4
to cost less than US$200,000 each) and Indian contractors are competitive in
this kind of construction, international competitive bidding would not be
suitable. Instead, tenders would be nationally advertised in packages of
three or more contracts, except in states where only one or two structures
are to be built. Contractors would be able to bid for any one contract
individually or for any combination of contracts or for the entire package
(total cost US$21.2 million).
12.       For the new construction of new bag storage warehouse (Model A),
international competitive bidding would again not be suitable for the same
reasons as given above. Instead, for each site, tenders for civil works,
auxiliary buildings, electricals, and site improvement would be let in one
contract, and the railvay sidings would be let in a separate contract. Total
cost is estimated at US$56.3 million. Tenders would be packaged and adver-
tised nationally and state wide as sites become available. Bid procedure
and evaluatiou would be the same as described in para 11.
13.       Civil works (US$24.0 million, at 19 sites in 9 states) for bulk
storage (Models B, C and D) warehouse complexes would be grouped in packages
of three or more contracts and awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding. Civil works for the two port silos (US$7.5 million) would
be combined into one contract and awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding.
14.       Civil work contracts for railway sidings (US$18.2 million) range
from US$200,000 to US$300,DOO each. The work at 73 sites is highly specia-
lized, and needs to be coordinated closely with the existing railway system.
Competitive bidding therefore would not be appropriate, and civil work con-
tracts for each location would be awarded by FCI to the Railway Board subject
to review and approval by IDA.
15.       Electrical/Mechanical Ecuipments.  Separate tenders will be pre-
pared for weighbridges, temperature indicator systems, aeration fans and
ducts, railway scales, passenger elevators and railwagon movers for all sites,
bulked to the extent practical, and awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. Miscellaneous equipment items not lending themselves
to bulking or expected to cost less than US$100,000 when bulked would be
procured by nationally advertised tenders, and prudent shopping would be
used for items costing less than US$10,000.  Tenders for material handling
systems, i.e. grain conveyors, bucket elevators, truck dumpers, grain
reclaimers, grain valves and spouts for all the sites would be packaged
to the extent practical and awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding. The hopper-bottom railwagons and paper grain door retainers
would be packaged separately and awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding on a one-time basis. The 50 grain trucks would be pro-
cured on the basis of nationally advertised competitive bidding from
suppliers able to provide spare parts and maintenance services.

D. Accounts and Audits
16.       FCI would maintain separate accounts for expenditures under this
project. The annual budgets and accounts prepared by FCI should distinguish
project activities from its other operations. FCI's annual accounts would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA 1/. Copies of these
documents would be submitted to IDA as follows:
Annual budgets not later than two months prior to the
commitment of FCI's financial year;
Quarterly progress reports written one month of the
close of each quarter; and
Audited final accounts of the project within four
months of the close of FCI's financial year.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
17.       On the basis of the detailed project implementation plan (to be
finalized), the Chief of PID (or, preferably, an assistant in charge of
monitoring, and reporting to him) would monitor and compare actual project
progress with that planned. Problems could then be identified or foreseen,
evaluated and action taken to solve or avoid them while sticking to plan
schedule. IDA, through receipt of quarterly progress report from PID (on
land acquisition, tendering, bid awards, procurement, disbursement, construc-
tion, training etc.) and periodic supervision missions, would help to ensure
the adequacy of the monitoring and evaluation being carried out and to solve
the problems that occur.
18.       The operations research studies described in para 8, to be financed
under the project, would constitute an ex-post evaluation of the relative costs
and benefits of the various types of warehouses, and more generally, of the
system of bulk handling, storage and transportation of grain. This would help
in the planning aud design of future projects in India and even possibly
elsewhere.
1/   The present audit arrangements are acceptable to IDA.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Economic Benefits and Justification
A. General
1.        The purpose of the project is to assist GOI in carrying out its
program of constructing storage facilities required to implement its foodgrain
procurement and distribution policy. This policy is discussed in detail in
Annex 3. It's objectives are, through procurement and/or support price, to
assure foodgrain producers of a stable, reasonably attractive price in order
to encourage continuing increases in foodgrain production, leading to self-
sufficiency, and, through the distribution of procured and imported foodgrains,
to safeguard the interests of low income consumers.
B. Economic Analysis
2.        Without the warehouse storage component of the project, and with the
procurement and distribution of wheat and rice in the projected quantities
shown in Annex 3, Tables 7 and 11, the wheat and rice so procured will have to
be stored in the open, under cover and plinth (CAP). In fact, about 7 million
tons of foodgrains are under such storage as a result of high procurement
consequent upon two successive good harvests. The economic benefit of the
warehouse component would be the reduction in operating costs and in grain
losses from storing procured grain in the various warehouses proposed in the
project, compared to open CAP storage. The reduction in grain losses is
equivalent to a reduction in imports (since India is a grain importer), and
hence a saving on foreign exchange. Since-grain trade (imports and, possibly
in the future, exports) will continue, the port silo component of the project
is provided to reduce the cost of handling such grain. The economic rates of
return calculated below is therefore based on the stream of savings in costs
between the 'with' and 'without project' situation.
3.        The following assumptions about prices and costs are made, with
explanations provided, where necessary: (i) Exchange rate. The official
exchange rate prevailing in February/March 1977, during appraisal, of US$1-
8.75 Rs, is used for traded goods. (ii) Base year prices. The investment and
operating costs of the project are estimated during 1976/77 and are expressed
in 1976/77 constant rupees. The price of wheat and rice used is the projected
1985 international price (see below), expressed in 1977 constant dollars, and
converted to rupees at the official exchange rate. The reason is that since
the project will not be completed until 1981, and has an estimated 25 year
economic life, the greater part of benefits will take place after 1985, the



ANNEX 12
Page 2
latest year for which projections are available. (iii) Investment and opera-
ting costs. All the inputs and factors in these costs are estimated at market
prices (see Annex 9). Taxes and duties have been estimated to be negligible
and are therefore ignored. Physical contingencies at the rates shown in
Annex 9, Table 10 are included in the costs. No attempt is made to calculate
the shadow wage for the direct and indirect labor cost components. Shadow wage
rates for most of the 112 proposed project sites, located all over India, would
be different, and their calculation would pose an immense task. (iv) Wheat and
rice price. The wheat price used was Canadian No. 1, CWRs in store, Thunder
Bay. The rice price used was Thai, 25%-35: broke, f.o.b. Bangkok. The proj-
ected 1985 price of wheat and rice, expressed in 1977 constant dollars, was
$187/metric ton and $207/metric ton respectively. 1/ Shipping costs were
estimated at US$30/MT for wheat and US$15/MT for rice. Port handling plus rail
freight costs from ports to warehouses were estimated to average US$10/MT for
both wheat and rice. Therefotg, values of 227/MT for wheat and $233/MT for
rice were used in calculati4tthe project's reduction in grain losses. To
obtain the rice - equivalent value of paddy, the conversion ratio of 66% was
used, yielding $153/MT of paddy.
4.        Warehouse Component.  Table 1 shows three 25-year cost streams -
capital, operating and grain loss - in the 'without project' situation of CAP
storage of wheat and paddy under the assumptions of (i) six months storage and
one turnover annually (i.e. 50% capacity utilization annually); and (ii) two
years storage and one turnover every two years (i.e. 100% capacity utilization
annually). These two assumptions vere made to approximate the respective
storage requirements of operational stocks and annual carry-over contingency
stocks. Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 show the same cost streams under the same as-
sumptions in the 'with project' situation for Models A, B, C and D warehouse
complexes. These cost streams are based on 50,000 MT storage capacity for
wheat and 37,500 MT for paddy.
5.        Some explanation of the cost streams is necessary.  The annual
capital cost stream pertains only to the storage stage and is the initial
capital cost incurred and the subsequent maintenance or replacement costs.
The annual operating cost stream pertains to three stages: procurement into
storage, storage, and distribution to State Governments. This is because
operating costs were estimated to be lower at all three stages as a result
of the project. 2/ Obviously, in the two year storage case, operating costs
are higher in the year grain is turned over.  For convenience, an annual
average was used. Finally, the annual grain loss stream pertains to the
storage stage. Again, in the two year storage case, the annual average grain
loss was used. For simplicity too, it was assumed that there would be no
grain loss in year 1, when the capital costs for the warehouses and CAP stor-
age are being incurred. Also, since Models B, C and D are estimated to take
two years to construct, it is assumed that operating costs and grain loss
1/   See Annual Review of Commodity Price Forecasts, memorandum, April 11, 1977
and attached annexes by the Economic Analysis and Projections Department.
2/   Operating Costs of Models B, C and D are estimated to be further reduced
by the project's provision of procurement centers, grain trucks and
railway equipment. See Annex 9, Table 11.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
for these Models in year 2 would be the same as CAP storage - the 'without
project' situation.
6.        Port Silo Component.  Tables 6 and 7 show four 25-year cost streams --
capital, operating, freight and demurrage - of the present 'without project'
wheat unloading port operation and those of an unloading operation using port
silos respectively (the silos cannot be used to handle rice, which is imported
in bags). Each port silo unloading unit (there are two) has a handling capa-
city of 500 tons per hour and 10-12,000 tons a day. Each grain evacuator
(five are assumed) -- the 'without project' situation -- has a handling capa-
city of 30 tons per hour and 600 tons per day.
7.        Operating cost per ton for both the 'with' and 'without project'
situations is shown in Annex 9, Table 12. In both situations, wheat is re-
ceived in bulk, bagged at the ports and then transported to FCI warehouses
inland. In the 'with project' situation, there are two savings in freight
costs: (a) savings from shorter unloading time at berths; and (b) savings
from wheat being transported in larger ships as a result of the project.
Table 8 shows the freight rates per ton of foodgrain from US/Canada to India
in both the 'with' and 'without project' situations for varying ship tonnages.
In the 'without project' situation, 20,000 DWT ships will be used; with the
project, it is assumed that one-third of the grain will be carried in 20,000
DWT ships, another one-third in 30,000 DWT ships and the remaining one-third
in 40,000 DWT ships. Finally, demurrage cost is estimated at Rs 12.5 per ton
without the project; there is no such cost with the project.
0                       C.  Economic Rate of Return
8.        Warehouse Component.  The economic rates of return were calculated
from the differences between the sum of cost streams of CAP storage and that
of Models A, B, C and D, individually. The results for wheat and paddy under
the two assumptions regarding storage period and turnover, together with sen-
sitivity tests, are shown in Table 9, Part I. Except for six months' storage
of paddy under Model A, the other economic rates of return are high or at
least satisfactory. About 60% of the storage space would be used for wheat
and about 69% of the warehouse investment is for Model A. Using these figures
as weights and considering six months' storage, the ROR for the warehouse
component is about 19.0%. In all cases, the rates of return are most sensi-
tive to percentage increases in operating cost, which is not surprising as
it is the largest cost stream, covering three stages. At full development,
these warehouse facilities would enable FCI to reduce storage losses by
180,000 tons of wheat and paddy per year valued at about Rs 200 million
(US$22.9 million) and to save on operating cost by about Rs 300 million
(US$34.3 million).
9.        As noted, paddy stored for six months under Model A shows a rela-
tively low rate of return, and it may be that in such cases paddy is better
stored under CAP. On the other hand, if rice, instead of paddy, were stored



ANNEX 12
Page 4
for six months under Model A, the rate of return would be higher, probably
about 15%, since more rice (40,000 MT) can be stored than paddy (37,500 MT)
and since rice losses under CAP storage would be higher.
10.       Despite the high returns shown for Models B, C and D, Model A consti-
tutes the greater part of the project for three reasons: (i) bulk flat storage
is still untried in India, and the provision of it under the project may be
regarded as a pilot scheme; (ii) the unavailability of sufficient matching
bulk handling and transportation capacity in the near future; and (iii) there
are areas where the volume of procurement and/or distribution is small and bulk
handling, transport and storage may not be feasible.
11.       Port Silo Component.  The economic rates of return are again cal-
culated from the streams of savings in cost, particularly in freight costs.
The rates for 300,000 M.T. and 450,000 M.T. annual throughputs, together with
the sensitivity tests, are shown in Table 9, Part II. It would seem that the
port silos need to handle only 0.3 million tons of wheat a year to obtain a
more than satisfactory rate of return. Between 1970/71 and 1975/76, India
imported on average 3.36 million tons of wheat a year. However, the pro-
jections in Annex 2, Table 14 show that India will reach a self-sufficiency
in wheat by the end of the 1970s and have an increasing surplus thereafter.
The projections also show an increasing rice deficit. But it is unlikely
that India will be able to import rice at the amounts projected for the dif-
ference between rice production and consumption (4.56 million tons in 1985-86,
constituting about 35% of the international rice trade in 1985, projected at
13.0 million tons) without pushing up its price significantly. This, in turn,
is likely to cause substitution of wheat for rice, causing wheat imports to
be greater than projected. In any case, even if the projections hold, and
India attains a consistent surplus in wheat production (amounting to 1.3 mil-
lion tons in 1985-86), the silos can equally well be used to export wheat and
achieve similar handling cost reductions.
D. Financial Rate of Return
12.       The only difference between financial and economic costs for the
warehouses is the addition of the respective purchase tax (5%) and interest
cost on inventory holding to the economic operating costs of CAP and the four
warehouse storages. The annual financial operating costs of the different
storages are shown in brackets at the bottom of the economic operating cost
columns of Tables 1 to 4. Table 6 shows the financial rates of return for
the warehouses calculated under the same two assumptions, with sensitivity
test performed only for operating costs. As in the case of economic rates,
with same one exception, the financial rates of return are high or satis-
factory. The financial rate shows even greater sensitivity to changes in
operating costs, because the financial operating costs are substantially larger
than the corresponding economic operating costs for all storage types. There
is no difference between the economic and the financial rate of return in the
case of the port silos.
