MALLI
FORESTRY PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Project: Background
1.01      Following the severe drought of the early 1970's, a conference was
held in 1976 on the possibilities for forestry development in the Sahelian
countries of West Africa. During this conference, each country submitted
a list of project ideas in the forestry sector. A Bank/Cooperative Program
mission visited Niger, Mali and Upper Volta in February/March 1977 and con-
cluded that a forestry project in each of these countries would be justified
if priority was given to:
(a)  increase fuelwood and building pole supplies, especially
for the main urban areas whiere demand for wood is rising
fast, through rainfed and/or irrigated plantations; and
(b)  improve management of natural forests and assist rural
forestry activities, which would counteract the gradual
destruction of the fragile natural forest cover due to
agrarian and grazing pressures.
1.02      A pilot and technical assistance forestry project in Niger was
subsequently prepared and appraised, and was approved by the Board on May 16,
1978. A forestry project in Upper Volta is presently under appraisal. For
Mali, a feasibility study was prepared by the Cooperative Program and was
submitted to the Bank in March 1978. The French bilateral aid agency (FAC)
and the "Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique" (CCCE) participated in
project appraisal in April/May 1978 to examine the possibilities for co-
financing.
B. The Sectoral Context
2
1.03      Mali has a total area of 1.24 million km  and a population of
6.3 million, growing at 2.7% per anntum, but with an urban growth rate of 7%.
About 90% of the population is engaged in agriculture or related pursuits, and
per capita income is only US$110 per year (1977) which classifies the country
as one of the 25 poorest in the world. For the 1973-1976 period which covers
the drought and post-drought years, real GDP growth averaged 3.7% per annum,
corresponding to an increase in GDP per capita of 1% annually; GDP growth in
1977 is likely to have been less, however, due to a return of drought con-
ditions over extensive areas.



- 2 -
1.04      Cotton and groundnuts are the country's main cash and export crops.
Main food crops are millet and sorghum, and paddy: in years of satisfactory
rainfall, output of these crops is estimated at 1 million tons and 250,000
tons re'-"ct-vely, at which levels no significant cereal imports ir' zcs-'
sary. Cattle is an important source of revenue, providing slightly less
than half of the value of agricultural output; exports of live cattle were
significant until the drought of the early 1970's but herds have not yet
fully recovered from losses during the drought years.
1.05      Less than 25% of the territory receives over 500 mm of rainfall in
normal years and is suitable for crop production; about 75% of the population
lives in this area. Yet, because of the size of the country and relatively
low population densities, the per capita endowment of land suitable for crop
production or pasture is still higher than in other countries (about 5 ha per
inhabitant). This is particularly true for land in the Sudano-Guinean zone
with rainfall over 800 mm annually (90% probability) and where two thirds of
the population lives: with 1 ha of arable land in this zone for each inhabit-
ant, Mali is about 50% better off than the Sahelian countries as a whole; and
100% with respect to grazing land. As a result, agrarian and grazing pres-
sures on the natural forest cover are significantly less than in other
Sahelian countries.
C. the Forestry Subsector
Resources
1.06      Mali's natural vegetation consists of:
(a) 6% Guinean Savannah (annual rainfall above 1,200 mm) in the
southern part of the country, characterized by bush vegetation
with Isoberlinia Doka, Uapaca Somon, Erythrophleun guineense,
and Lophira Alata and some dry but dense forests with Khaya
Senegalensis, Afzelia Africana, Pterocarpus Erinaceus,
Daniella Olivieri, and Cordyla Pinnata.
(b) 27% Soudanian Savannah characterized by: (1) Park savannah
(annual rainfall, 750-1,200 mm) with Butyrospermum Parkii,
Parkia Biglobosa, Acacia Albida, Tamarindus Indica, Adansonia
Digitata and Bombax Costatum and (2) Grass Savannah (annual
rainfall 500-750 mm) with bush species such as Combretum
species, Guiera Senegalensis, Zizyphus and Acacia.
(c) 16% Sahelian steppe (annual rainfall 200-500 mm) with charac-
teristic bushes of Acacia, Zizyphus, Calotropis Procera and
Hyphaena Thebaica.
(d) 21% Tropical subdesert steppe (annual rainfall 50-200 mm); and
(e) 30% Desert.



- 3 -
The forest and fauna reserves and parks cover some four million hectares and
represent about 3% of Mali's total area. Man-made forests only cover some
1,500 ha, planted mainly in Gmelina arborea, Teak, Neem (Azadarichta indica)
and Eucalyptus.
1.07      The forestry sector accounted only for about 1.9% _f GDP in 1976 and
5.2% of exports in 1975 (mainly sheanuts, sheanut butter and oil, and gum
arabic). However, official statistics on the value of forest output do not
adequately reflect the important role played by the natural forest savannah
and bush in providing fuelwood, building poles and minor forest products to
meet the population's basic needs.  I'he country's total fuelwood requirements
are estimated at about 1.7 million tcon per annum of which 17% are used by the
urban population - nearly 800,000 inhabitants - on the basis of a yearly
consumption of 360 kg per person in the urban areas and 270 kg per person in
the rural areas. About 10% of the total fuelwood production is consumed as
charcoal. Building poles represent some 10% of total consumption. Moreover
the natural forest provides fruits, tree fodder and dry weather grazing
reserves for livestock, protects the soil against erosion, and - as bush
fallow - regenerates soil fertility under the traditional shifting cultivation
system.
1.08      Due to the size of the country and relatively low population
densities (para. 1.05) the cutting of fuelwood in the rural areas has not
generally led to a decline in the forest cover with its inherent dangers
of ecological destruction, and fuelwood availability is still sufficient.
There are, however, two areas in MaliL where the situation is fundamentally
different.
1.09      Firstly, there is an accelerating decline in the natural forest
cover around the capital city of Bamako. Rapid population growth in this
city has led to an equally rapid growth in fuelwood consumption, now esti-
mated at 200,000 tons annually and expected to rise to 500,000 tons per year
by 1990. This compares with a theoretical wood yield of 250,000 tons per
year in the Bamako area but, due to distance and difficulty of access, only
about 50% of this is actually being exploited. As a result, distances are
getting longer, wood transport to the city is becoming more costly, and fuel-
wood prices have been rising by 15% each year on average over the past five
years.
1.10      Secondly, there is a noticeable decline in the natural forest cover
east of the Inner Delta of the Niger River; the decline is mostly concentrated
around the towns of Segou and Mopti and adjacent rural areas. Although urban
population levels are considerably lower here than in and around Bamako, urban
growth rates are about as rapid while fuelwood supplies are more precarious;
most of the Inner Delta is seasonally flooded and has only a sparse forest and
bush cover, and, in areas where the forest cover is still in existence, sus-
tained wood yields are small due to slow forest regrowth because of low
rainfall (700 mm annually at Segou, and 500 mm annually at Mopti). Moreover,
the traditional fish smoking industry in the Niger Delta area is an important
additional consumer of fuelwood. The supply situation is perhaps the most
preoccupying in Mopti: the distance between the town and its fuelwood sources



-4-
n-dw between 50 km and 100 km, and fuelwood prices are some 40% higher than
in BaTnako.
nstit lJt:nns
1.11      The Forestry Department under the Ministry of Rural Development has
overall responsibility for forest protection, forest products, inland fishing,
fauna conservation and wildlife management. It has three divisions at head-
quarters, concerned with forestry, fishing and wildlife, and is organized
into seven field districts each with its normal policing duties.  The Minis-
try has, however, delegated important functions in the forestry sector to
so-called Ope'rations de Developpement, institutions charged to carry out
specific projects, mostly assisted by foreign aid and enjoying a consider-
able amount of financial and mianagerial autonomy. Three such "operations"
presently exist in this sector: the Forestry Management and Production
Agency (OAPF) assisted by French bilateral aid (FAC), the Mopti Fisheries
Development Agency (OPM), assiSted by the European Development Fund (FED),
and the Baoule Park Wildlife Management Agency (OPNBB), assisted by Dutch
aid.
1.12      OAPF was established in 1972 with the task to create some 18,000 ha
of tree plantations over a 30-year period, mostly to satisfy the fuel and
construction wood requirements of the main urban centers. Since then, it
has rehabilitated some 300 ha of old plantations and has planted about 400
ha mostly with a relatively fast growing species of Gmelina, in two forest
reserves close to Bamako. Overall planting quality has been quite satisfac-
tory, and about 95% of all plantings have been successful. All forestry
operations have been carried out by local personnel (it has a permanent
staff of about 50 employees) and foreign technical assistance to date has
been minimal, limited to equipment maintenance and accounting. Present FAC
financing provides for another 900 ha of plantations to be established during
1979 and 1980.
1.13      OAPF is now entering into a phase of rapid expansion:  it is pre-
sently building a small saw mill in Bamako; it has obtained financing from
Swiss bilateral aid to establish two tree plantations and two saw mills, and
to manage natural forests in Southern Mali, and it would also be entrusted
with the execution of the proposed project. The additional activities would
require further strengthening of the organization, especially in the managerial
and administrative field (paras. 4.04-4.05).
1.14      Forestry education is provided by the "Katibougou Polytechnic
Institute", which delivers university trained graduates ("ingenieurs des
eaux et forets") and specialized undergraduates ("ingenieurs des travaux
forestiers"). The institute is the only forestry training school existing
in the Sahelian countries and, as a result, Mali has a large reservoir of
well trained forestry staff: in 1977 some 50 forestry specialists - mostly
trained at Katibougou - were working in Mali, compared to only four in
Senegal and six in Niger. Furthermore, forestry training for field agents
is provided at the OAPF-managed Tabacoro Training Center near Bamako. The
quality of training is on the whole sufficient especially in the technical



- 5 -
field. For key personnel in the forestry services, however, additional
training in administrative and financial management would be beneficial.
1.15      Forestry research is formally linked to the Rural Economic Insti-
tute (IER) but has its headquarters at Katibougou. Research is presently
limited to small scale trials and its most important component, tree growing
under irrigated conditions in the Niger delta area, has so far had unsatis-
factory results.
1.16      As a whole, Mali is institutionally well ahead in the foresty
field compared to other Sahelian countries. Its main asset is the presence of
trained Malian forestry staff with the capacity to be efficient in the field.
Another important advantage is the existence of a National Forestry Fund which
receives all revenue from logging, hunting and fishing permits and by law
allocates 50% of its revenue to the Forestry Department for investment and
protection purposes. Since the Fund's creation in 1967, it has channeled some
MF 500 million (US$1.1 million) to the Forestry Department. Nevertheless, all
forestry services suffer from severe budget constraints which make it impos-
sible for them to cover operating costs and thus effectively carry out their
assigned tasks. The only exception to this is OAPF which has its own revenue
from the sale of wood products from plantations and classified forests which
it manages: its wood sales, which exceeded MF 77 million (US$0.2 million) in
1977, are sufficient to cover its operating costs.
Objectives and Strategies
1.17      The immediate priority in Mali's forestry sector would be the
improvement of fuelwood and building pole supplies to the main urban centers
by establishing tree plantations. This would help (a) to contain the rapid
rise in fuelwood prices in the future, which would be directly beneficial
to the lower income urban groups who cannot afford other types of fuel; and
(b) to contain and, eventually, remedy the decline of the natural forest cover
around the towns, thus preventing further environmental destruction. Experi-
ence has proven that rainfall arouncl Bamako (averaging 1,100 mm annually) is
sufficient to provide satisfactory wzood yields for selected spesies under
rainfed conditions (Gmelina and Eucalyptus yielding about 9.5 m /ha/year) and
that there are sufficient grounds to start large scale rainfed tree planta-
tions in this area. No such experience, however, exists elsewhere in the
country; while rainfed plantations are still thought to be possible around
Segou, it is believed that around Mopti tree plantations would have to be
irrigated at least during the first years after planting. Pilot plantations
would therefore have to be started t:o obtain further data on these areas.
1.18      The next priority would be to devise appropriate actions in the
rural forestry field. Although the natural forest cover outside the urban
areas is not yet declining, it is expected that within ten to fifteen years,
with increased population pressures, a disequilibrium between demand and
natural supplies will arise in more regions than has hitherto been the case.
It is therefore imperative to start testing rural forestry actions, i.e.
aimed at increasing the supply of fuelwood and wood products close to



- 6 -
villages, and with the active participation of the rural population.
Activities carried out in this field in the past, notably the establish-
ment of village wood lots and t'he prevention of bush fires, have been largely
unsuccessful because of disinterest on the part of the local population.
Such actions have therefore to 'be reformulated with a view to provide suffi-
cient incentive to the population to participate.
1.19      A third priority is for the forest services to undertake the manage-
ment of natural forest reserves in the country. No modern management techni-
ques are presently applied in Maili's forest reserves, mainly because of lack
of funds.  Yet, the application of known techniques would have three distinct
advantages: it would substantially improve wood production while still main-
taining the forest cover; it woujld put the present trained forestry staff to
more effective work; and if properly managed it would produce revenue from
sale of wood and wood products at least equal to the management costs.
Priority areas to introduce these techniques would be near the urban centers,
where effective wood demand is greatest.
1.20      The proposed forestry project emphasizes improved wood production
near the urban centers and carri.es components dealing with all the above
objectives; it therefore corresponds to the Government's expressed strategy
for this subsector.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Introduction
2.01      The project's main comlponent, the creation of 3,400 ha of rainfed
tree plantations and 1,000 ha of natural forest management, both near Bamako,
would be carried out in two forest reserves, one of 14,500 ha located 20 km
from the city (Monts Mandingues) and one of 80,000 ha 50 km from the city (La
Faya). The Mopti and Segou pilot components and the establishment of rural
nurseries would be carried out at various locations in the region between
Bamako and Mopti in the northern part of the Soudanian-Savannah Zone (see para
1.06). Two maps are attached indicating the project's locations.
Climate, Topography and Soils
2.02      Both the Monts Mandingues and La Faya forest reserves are located
in the southern part of the Soudanian-Savannah Zone (para 1.06) alongside the
Niger River, as is the city of Bamako. The climate of the area is charac-
terized by a seven-month dry spell and a rainy season of five months (June-
October) with annual rainfall averaging 1,100 mm. Much of the countryside
around Bamako especially north of the Niger River is hilly and about half of
the soils are considered unsuitable for cropping or grazing: sizeable areas
are made up of eroded skeleton soils and are void of vegetation. Lands in the
two forest reserves, however, are relatively flat with soils of better quality,
easily accessible by all-weather roads. A survey of soils and vegetation
(including detailed mapping) in the two forest reserves, financed by FAC,



- 7 -
is being carried out and results are expected to be available by the end of
1978. Without prejudging the conclusions of the survey, it can be safely
estimated that at least 30% of these lands are of good to excellent quality
for tree planting, and that land availability problems are therefore unlikely
to arise.
Population and Wood Consumption
2
2.03      The Greater Bamako urban area covers about 300 km  and has a
population of some 550,000 inhabitants (of whom 430,000 live within the
city limits). Most of the urban population has migrated to town over the
last ten years and urban unemployment is high. A detailed survey on fuelwood
consumption and prices in Bamako, made in February 1978, has shown that
(a) consumption per inhabitant per year is 370 kg of wood (about 1 kg per day)
and 17 kg of charcoal; charcoal therefore only covers some 7% of consumption
in calory terms; (b) retail prices of wood average about 14 MF per kg and, at
these prices, the satisfaction of fuelwood needs requires between 20% and 30%
of an average urban family's income; and (c) most wood and charcoal are burnt
on open fires, and ovens are little used, thus accounting for important energy
losses.
Wood Trade and Processing
2.04      Practically all of the wood trade is in private hands and 75% of
wood supplies enter Bamako by motorized transport. OAPF, which presently
exploits two forest reserves, transports wood to Bamako for sale to private
wholesalers, to the two saw mills and the match factory, and at present covers
less than 4% of total consumption. Its share of fuelwood supplies would
however more than triple with the implementation of projects now being con-
sidered and the projected saw mills (para 1.13) would enable it to enter into
the expanding processed construction wood business.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Design Features
Project Description
3.01      The proposed project would be the first Bank Group-financed action
in Mali's forestry sector. It would be carried out over five years (1980
to 1984) according to the implementation schedule in para 3.10 and would
consist of five principal elements:
(a)  the establishment of 3,400 ha of rainfed tree plantations in
two forest reserves near Bamako;
(b)  the application of modern management techniques on a trial
basis over 1,000 ha of natural forest near Bamako, and 200 ha
of natural forest near Segou;
(c)  the establishment, on a trial basis, of 60 ha of rainfed tree
plantations near Segou and of 70 ha of partially irrigated
tree plantations near Mopti;
(d)  the establishment of three forestry nurseries at
Bamako, Segou and Mopti, and the rehabilitation of an
existing one at San to provide trees to villagers through
established extension services; and
(e)  the execution of studies to investigate more efficient wood
uses, to examine the set up of rural forestry activities
with a view to providing sufficient incentives for the
population to participate, and to examine the scope of a
possible follow-up project.
Detailed Features
3.02      Bamako Rainfed Tree Plantations (see Tables 4 and 16).  Of a total
of 3,400 ha to be planted mostly with Gmelina Arborea, 1,100 ha would be in
the Monts Mandingues forest and 2,300 ha in La Faya forest. Works, which
wuld be carried out on force account by OAPF with its own material and
material which would be provided by the project, would include the establish-
ment of three nurseries of 1.5 ha each, clear felling of the natural forest
followed by full destumping, harrowing and subsoil ripping to improve the
water holding capacity of the soil. The seedlings would subsequently be
planted, and for two years after planting, two weedings per year would be made
to avoid weed infestation among the young plants. Simultaneously, all planta-
tion tracks and firebreaks would be constructed and accommodations for workers
and supervisory staff built. Wood recovered from the low value natural forest
would be cut and sorted, and transported to Bamako for sale.
3.03      All plantation establishment works have to be done during the
rainy season and only six weeks per year are suitable for the planting of



- 9 -
seedlings.  Experience has showrn that most works have to be carried out
with machinery rather than manual la!bour because of (a) the very tight work
schedule; (b) the fact that during t.he rainy season few workers are available
for hire due to peak labour requirements for cropping; and (c) the lack of
manpower availability around plantation sites which would require costly
transport and accommodations.  It is estimated that in addition to the use of
equipment about 90 mandays of labor input would be required over three years
to establish 1 ha of rainfed tree plantation (see Table 11).
3.04      Natural Forest Management (See Tables 6, 7 and 17).  Natural forest
management would be undertaken in the La Faya forest reserve near Bamako and
in the Dioforongo forest reserve near Segou. Natural forest management would
lead to better natural regeneration and regrowth through protective measures
against encroachments and bushfires, intermediate and regeneration cuttings,
complementary seeding, harrowing and weeding. The application of these tech-
niques would be preceded by the setting up of a working plan including site
location, a forestry inventory, the marking of trees, and the construction of
roads, tracks and firebreaks. Promising results have been obtained with these
techniques in Nigeria, in areas of similar rainfall volume 3and intensity as
around Bamako, with sustained yields increasing from 0.5 m /ha/year to 1.0 m3/
ha/year. No experience yet exists in areas with lower rainfall, such as
around Segou, and provisions are made for a careful follow up on the results
of both trials. It is estimated that about 50 mandays of labor input would be
required over three years to manage 1 ha of natural forest (see Table 11).
3.05      Rainfed and Irrigated Plantation Trials (See Tables 5, 8 and 16).
For the 60 ha pilot rainfed plantation near Segou in the Diogorongo forest
reserve, the same clearing and planting techniques would be used as described
in para. 3.02. In view of the absence of planting experience and the more
marginal rainfall conditions in this area, however, three different species
would be tried: Gmelina arborea, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Azadarichta
indica (Neem), and each species would occupy about 20 ha. Estimated establish-
ment cost per ha, excluding contingencies, would amount to US$720 in Bamako
and US$560 in Segou without taking account of receipts from sales of salvage
wood.
3.06      The 70 ha tree plantation trials near Mopti would, in view of low
rainfall locally, be irrigated during the first two years after planting to
enable tree roots to reach the groundwater table. Trials would take place
at two different locations: (1) along the Niger River at Tongorongo, 40 ha
would be planted with Eucalyptus with water provided by pumping from the
river to test various irrigation techniques, and (2) at Sevare, 15 km inland
from Mopti, 30 ha would be planted also with Eucalyptus but with water
provided by tubewell. As the latter site necessitates a higher investment,
it would only be started in the thircl project year, when tree growth per-
formance on the first site is already known. Both sites, which already
belong to the Forestry Department, would be fenced and all-weather plantation
tracks and firebreaks would be constructed. A preliminary estimation of
establishment cost per ha, including fencing and excluding contingencies,
would amount to approximately US$1,000. There will be no competition for
water with rice cultivation practiced in the Mopti area.

3.07      Rural Forestry NurserLes (See Table 9).  One existing rural forestry
nursery (at San) would be rehabilitated and three new ones (at Bamako, Segou
and Mopti) would be established together with the project plantation nurseries.
Each would be designed for a capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 seedlings per year.
In order to avoid the poor results obtained in this field previously, the
nurseries would (a) as a first stage, only provide shade, fodder and fruit
tree seedlings in which villagers are more directly interested; (b) provide
seedlings only through established extension services so that advice can be
given and results can be followed up; and (c) promote plantings in family
compounds rather than in communal (village) woodlots. Meanwhile, a detailed
survey would be undertaken on rural forestry possibilities (para. 3.08) and
the results of this survey would be taken into account in project imple-
mentation as they become available. Field training would be provided for
extension workers on rural afforestation techniques and possible approaches
to encouraging the participation of rural people.
3.08      Studies and Surveys (See Table 10).  The project would execute three
studies in the forestry sector: (a) on better uses of wood, ways and means
would be sought to obtain more efficient wood usage such as through preserva-
tive treatment and the use of wood burning stoves and charcoal, and cost com-
parisons would be made between the various alternatives and present methods;
(b) on rural forestry possibilities, a survey would be made in a number of
villages on wood and wood product requirements, and on the villagers' motiva-
tion to participate in projects that would satisfy such need; this study
would make proposals regarding practical actions to be taken to promote rural
forestry schemes; and (c) a feasibility study would be made in 1983/84 to
examine the scope of a follow-up project from the data gathered by the OAPF
monitoring and evaluation system.
3.09      It is expected that 12 man-months of consultant services - at an
average cost of US$8,900 per month excluding contingencies (of which salary
and related benefits are US$6,300) - would be needed to implement the above
studies, and assurances were obtained during negotiations that such con-
sultants would be appointed on terms and conditions of employment, and with
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Association.
Implementation Schedule
3.10      Most of the equipment would be procured during the first two years
and studies would be started from the first year onwards with priority being
given to the rural forestry study. Implementation of the various physical
project components is scheduled as follows:

B. COST AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
Project Costs
3.11      Total project costs over the five-year development period (1980-
1984) are estimated at MF 4,150 million (US$9.4 million) of which the foreign
exchange component would be US$6.4 million or 68%. Project costs exclude
import duties and all clearly identifiable taxes since Government has indi-
cated its intention to waive them. Base cost estimates are based on prices
and quotes obtained during appraisal in 1978 and include physical contingen-
cies amounting to 10% of base cost estimates on all categories except per-
sonnel costs. The expected price increases applied as shown below are those
presently foreseen by the Bank.

Financing Arrangements
3.12      FAC and CCCE would participate in the financing of the proposed
project.  Of total project costs of US$9.4 million, IDA would contribute
US$4.5 million, FAC US$1.3 million and CCCE US$1.4 million, while the Govern-
ment of Mal, would cover the remaining cost of US$2.2 million.

3.13      Total external financing required would be equivalent to US$7.2
million or 77% of project cost. This amount would include US$0.8 million of
local costs. The standard term IDA credit of US$4.5 million would cover 48%
of project cost and would be equivalent to 70% of foreign exchange costs.
FAC would finance the services of expatriate personnel, at no cost to Govern-
ment. The CCE loan, the terms of which are to be defined between CCE and
Government, and the IDA credit would finance pari passu categories listed
under item 1 in the above summary. The IDA and CCCE funds would be added by
Government to the present OAPF capital to improve its financial base. A
financing agreement would be signed between Government and OAPF. Fulfillment
of conditions preceding initial disbursement of the CCCE loan, assignment of
expatriate personnel for the first two years of Project execution by FAC, and
the conclusion of a financing agreement satisfactory to IDA between Government
and OAPF would be conditions of effectiveness.
3.14      The Malian Government would contribute MF 980 million (US$2.2 mil-
lion) or 23% of project costs. Of this amount MF 180 million (US$0.4 million)
would be directly appropriated from the national budget to pay the salaries of



- 14 -
civil service staff seconded to OAPF and the remainder would come from revenue
accruing to OAPF from wood sales derived from the clearing of forest areas
under the Project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that OAPF
would deposit all such revenue into a separate account (para 3.20).
3.15      Expenditures to be financed in the first project year (1980) would
total some MF 825 million including contingencies (about US$1.9 million).
Assuming a lag of four months between the time the expenditure is incurred and
the time it is reimbursed, and taking into account that machinery and equip-
ment will probably be financed by direct payments to the supplier or by
letters of credit, the interim financing requirements would be MF 110 million
(US$0.25 million).  Experience with on-going projects indicates that cash
availability is a major factor limiting the pace of project implementation and
the rate of IDA disbursements. Therefore, an initial disbursement of US$0.25
million equivalent will be made jointly by IDA and CCCE into the special
project account (para. 3.20), wh,ich would serve as a revolving fund to finance
project expenditures. The procedure would be similar to that adopted for the
Drought Relief Fund (Credit 443-MLI). IDA and CCCE agreed at negotiations
that the respective contributions to the revolving fund will be 70% and 30%.
IDA would replenish its share of the fund upon receipt of satisfactory evi-
dence that expenditures made were eligible for financing out of the proceeds
of the Credit. Should, however, any disbursement out of the special account
fail to meet this condition, Government would be under obligation to deposit
the corresponding amount into thtat account. Assurances to that effect
were obtained at negotiations.
C. PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS, ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
Procurement
3.16      Contracts for machinery and vehicles (US$1.6 million excluding
contingencies) to be financed jointly by IDA and CCCE would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15% or the
level of import duties, whichever is lower.   Contracts for the construction
of houses, offices and workshops (US$0.6 million excluding contingencies)
would not be attractive to international contractors, and would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with local
procedures acceptable to IDA. For contracts of less than US$20,000 local
shopping on the basis of several quotations would be acceptable.
Disbursements
3.17      The IDA credit would be disbursed during 1980-1984 as follows, and
details are in Table 19.

4.   Unallocated                         0.5
4.5
3.18      Applications for credit withdrawal would be fully documented for
vehicles and equipment as well as for expatriate staff, consultants and
training, and certificates of expenditures would be required for Category 1
(other than vehicles and equipment).. In the latter case, works would be led
by the chief of the Fieldworks Division, accounts would be kept and controlled
by the Financial Director who would retain documentation supporting these
certificates of expenditure for inspection by supervision missions and external
audits.
Accounts and Audit
3.19      OAPF, as a state enterprise, is required each year: (1) to have its
accounts audited by the State Controller ("Commissaire aux Comptes"), and (2)
to prepare a balance sheet and profit and loss statement for approval by its
Board. However, while OAPF keeps its regular revenue and expenditure accounts
up to date, it does not prepare annual budgets and has not issued a balance
sheet or profit and loss statement since 1975, nor have its accounts been
audited since 1974. As a result the management has little knowledge of OAPF's
financial position through the year..
3.20      To remedy the situation, IAC has accepted a request from OAPF to
send two financial assistance missions which would help (1) to review OAPF's
accounting system; (2) to prepare a balance sheet and profit and loss statement
for the agency as of December 31, 1978; and (3) to prepare a budget for the
agency for FY 1979. The first miss:ion carried out in November 1978 produced a
preliminary report which shows that OAPF's financial situation would be sound.



- 16 -
The second mission, scheduled for February 1979, would produce a final report,
including the 1978 balance sheet, on the financial. position of OAPF. A
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be that this final
report, on the financial position of OAPF would be satisfactory to IDA and
approved by the Board of OAPF. Assurances were further obtained dnring
negotiations that (1) OAPF would open a special project account which would be
a condition of effectiveness of the Credit; (2) OAPF would maintain separate
project accounts; (3) the project accounts as well. as the accounts of OAPF as
a whole would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;
and (4) the audited statements would be submitted to IDA within six months
after the end of the financial year. The employment of independent auditors
would be initially financed out: of the proceeds of the IDA Credit and then by
Government (Table 10).

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Organization
4.01      The project would be implemented by OAPF under the technical and
administrative supervision of the Forestry Department, and the Director of
OAPF would be the Project Director. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that the Project Director would have qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Association.
4.02      The proposed project would be implemented by the existing organiza-
tional structure of OAPF at its Bamako headquarters, notably the four divi-
sions dealing with field works, equipment and input supplies, marketing, and
administration and finance. Each of these divisions would be strengthened and
the, field works division and equipment and supply division would be expanded
with field sections in the La Faya and Monts Mandingues forest reserves. The
pilot operations at Segou and Mopti would be managed by OAPF field agents
under the administrative supervision of the Forestry District Inspector of the
Forestry Department at Segou and Mopti. The design and technical supervision
of the pilot operations would however be carried out in association with the
consultants (para. 4.07). Similarly, the rural forestry nurseries at Segou,
San and Mopti would be managed by OAPF field agents and supervised by the
Forestry District Inspector in these towns, while the nursery near Bamako
would be fully under OAPF authority. An OAPF organization chart is presented
in Table 18.
4.03      The Project Director would be responsible for introducing a project
monitoring and reporting system with the assistance of consultants (para
4.07). Assurances were obtained during negotiations to this effect. A
further assurance was obtained that Government would, by the completion
date, prepare a project completion report.
4.04      While a reorganization of OAPF for purposes of the proposed project
would thus not be necessary, it is likely that, in view of the other activities
in which OAPF is about to engage (para. 1.13), additional field divisions
would be created which would add to the workload at headquarters, notably of
the marketing and the administration and finance divisions. Assurances
therefore were obtained during negotiations that, before implementing any
organizational reforms during the project implementation period, an organiza-
tion plan together with the proposed staffing would be submitted to the
Association for approval.
Staffing (See Table 12)
4.05      To implement the project, it is estimated that ten additional
forestry engineers, graduates from the Katibougou Polytechnic Institute, would
be recruited by OAPF, most of which would fill the positions of field sector
and subsector chiefs in the La Faya and Monts Mandingues forest reserves.
Given the large availability of Katibougou graduates in the country, no diffi-
culties are foreseen for their recruitment.



- 18 -
4.06      The post of Financial Director would be created: (a) to provide the
OAPF director with financial management and accounting information; and b) to
strengthen the administration and finance division, and provide in-service
training to its members. In addlition, two mechanics would be required to
manage the central OAPF workshop at Bamako and the two equipment maintenance
umits that would be established in the field. As persons with the desired
qualifications for these three positions are not available in the country, it
is expected that they would be recruited internationally and serve over the
full five years of the implementation period at a total cost, excluding con-
tingencies, of US$9,500 per working month for the Financial Director (of which
salary and related benefits are 'US $,700) and US$7,700 for the mechanics (of
which salary and related benefits are US$4,400).  Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that these posts would be filled by persons on terms and
conditions, and with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Associa-
tion.
Consultant Services
4.07      In addition to the 12 man-months of consultant services needed to
implement the complementary studies (para 3.09), provision has been made under
the project for 27 man-months of- consultant services at an average cost of
US$8,900 per month excluding contingencies (of which salary and related
benefits are US$6,300) to implement the different components of the project.
Of these 27 man-months, 12 man-months, ranging from two to four man-months per
year over four years, are necessary to design and supervise the irrigated
pilot plantation at Mopti; the supervision would include in the last project
year (1984) an in-depth analysis of the results obtained. The remaining
fifteen man-months have been retained: (1) to monitor the tree plantation and
natural forest management techn:iques that will be applied in the forest
reserves close to Bamako and Segou; (2) to examine the feasibility of using
different tree species for planlting; and (3) to set up a monitoring and
evaluation program and supervise its initial implementation by the field works
division of OAPF. Draft terms of reference for the services of consultants
have been made and assurances were obtained during negotiations that consult-
ants would be appointed on terms and conditions, and with qualifications and
experience acceptable to the Association.
Training
4.08      As specialized training in forestry techniques is already provided
at Katibougou, and the Swiss Aid project includes a large component for the
training of forestry field agents at the Tabacoro Center, training under
the proposed project would be limited to practical in-service training by the
OAPF expatriate staff in equipment maintenance and financial management, and
by consultants in tree plantation techniques and natural forest management.
Furthermore, US$57,000, excluding contingencies, has been included in the
project to provide scholarships for OAPF key personnel (visits to African
forestry research centers and projects, participation in forestry seminars
and workshops).

V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRICES AND INCOME
Production
5.01      Bamako Rainfed Plantations.  Gmelina, the main species to be planted
over 3,400 ha near Bamako, is a tropical hardwood that can be used both as
fuel and for construction purposes. The plantation production program is
based on the first results of the ongoing rainfed plantations and the follow-
ing assumptions:
(a) a distinction of three soil types in descending order
of soil quality, whereby onl Type III soils (estimated to
occupy 70% of the area) the quality of produce would only
permit its use as fuelwood and building poles;
(b)  a plantation life of 24 years, after which trees would be
cut and the land cleared for replanting;
(c)  a thinning cycle to harvest fuelwood, starting the sixth
year after planting and ranging from once every six years
to once every two years depending on soil quality; and
(d) a cutting cycle to harvest timber starting the eleventh
year after planting and repeated once every two to five
years depending on soil quclity.
5.02      On the basis of these assumaptions, one average3ha of planted Gmelina
would produce a mean annual in5remenl  (m.a.i.) of 8.17 m  of fuelwood includ-
ing building poles, and 1.42 m of timber, or a total m.a.i. of 9.59 m which
is in line with wood yields from the existing plantations. Following the im-
plementation schedule as outlined in para. 3.10, total production from the
Bamako rainfed plantations would be as summarized below. Detailed production
data are presented in Table 14.

5.03      Plantation and Forest Management Trials.  Given the experimental
nature of the small tree plantations at Segou and Mopti and the forest manage-
ment zones at Bamako and Segou, it would not be feasible to make well-founded
production estimates at this stage.  However, if managed correctly, a tent.-I4--
m.a.i. estimate of the Segou rainfed plantation would be between 3 and 4 m-
per Va, while for the Mopti irrigated plantation it would vary between 6 and
15 m per ha. Management of She natural forest is expected to double present
yields; thus, a m.a.i. of 1 m per ha could be reached around Bamako, and 0.7
m per ha around Segou.
Markets
5.04      Wood produced by the project is all expected to be absorbed by the
domestic market. In view of the growing fuelwood shortage in Bamako, no mar-
keting difficulties are foreseen; due to the dearth of regular truck transport
facilities, however, OAPF itself would have to transport the wood to Bamako
for sale to wholesalers. With the project, OAPF would about double its fuel-
wood supplies to Bamako, bringing up its share of the market from 4% to almost
8% on the basis of present (1978) consumption.
5.05      The sale of timber would enable OAPF to become a supplier tg the
construction business. The small but growing timber market (20,000 m ) is
at present supplied partially through imports from the Ivory Coast; supplies
from Southern Mali will become available when the Swiss bilateral aid project
has been completed (para 1.13). As transport distances from these two sources
of supply to Bamako are longer and transport costs higher than from the
project plantation sites, no problems are expected in marketing project
produce.
Prices
5.06      OAPF presently sells fuelwood to wholesalers at an average price of
2,800 MF per stere of 350 kg, which is equivalent to 8 MF per kg. One stere,
as it is cut in the forest, contains about 10% of wood long and straight
enough to be used as building poles, which are sold at 450 MF (US$1.02) per
pole at wholesale level. Assuming that on average thirteen poles weigh one
stere, the actual weighted price of a stere of fuelwood is 3,105 MF (US$7.05).
For Gmelina lgs to be used as timber, the actual price is about 25,000 FM
(US$57) per m  delivered at Bamako mills.
5.07      Average annual fuelwood output from the project, estimated at
about 44,500 steres, would not be sufficient to cover annual increases in
consumption due to urban population growth (about 51,000 steres). It there-
fore cannot be expected that project output would succeed in containing price
increases in real terms.  Fuelwood prices would continue to rise as a con-
sequence of increased fuelwood scarcity so that charcoal and, eventually,



-- 21 -
kerosene would have to be used as a source of energy. The economic value of
fuelwood would thus continue to rise! until it equals the value of imported
kerosene in terms of energy equivale!nt; based on IBRD projections of oil
prices, this would be the case from 1990 onwards when one stere of fuelwood
would be worth 5,600 MF in constant terms.
5.08      Prices for tropical hardwood logs in constant dollar terms, follow-
ing IBRD projections, are expected to be between 20 and 30% higher in 1985
than in 1978, depending on the species.  Gmelina logs produced on plantations,
although not of primary hardwood quality, would be of good construction quality
and able to compete with Samba wood presently imported from the Ivory Coast
at a jog price equivalent to between 30,000 and 35,000 MF (US$68 to US$80)
per m at the Bamako sawmill. Taking into account that the first Gmelina
logs would be produced only in the eleventh year after planting (1991), an
average conservative price rise of 25% in constant terms has been assumed to
value Gmelina timber output at that time.
Income
5.09      The project would generate revenue through the sale of wood from
plantations and from managed natural forests. Revenue from tree plantations,
which would constitute 85% of project-generated revenue, would materialize
slowly, as the first fuelwood cuttings would only take place in the sixth
year after planting and the first log cuttings from the eleventh year after
planting onwards. However, wood from the low value natural forest, cut in
order to establish the tree plantations, would be sold and produce revenue
during the first five project years, estimated to total about MF 1,080 million
(US$2.5 million). Revenue expected to be generated over the life of the
plantations would be as follows:
Period                 MF Million               US$ Million
1981-85                   1,080                     2.5
1986-90                   1,070                     2.4
1991-95                   1,310                     3.0
1996-2000                  1,225                    2.8
2001-05                   2,560                     5.8
2006-07                   2,545                     5.8
5.10      All revenue would accrue to OAPF.  The project cash flow forecast
(Table 20) shows that the above revenue would be sufficient to cover OAPF's
contribution to the financing of the project as well as maintenance expendi-
tures and operating costs on plantations and managed forests from the sixth
project year onwards. Assurances were obtained, at negotiations, that OAPF
would continue to operate and maintaiLn the project's plantations and managed
natural forests after the end of the project period out of this cash-flow.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
6.01      The project would generate direct benefits through increased
plantation wood production.  It would also lay the groundwork for future
investment decisions in the forestry sector as it would: (1) provide informa-
tion on sustained wood yields and introducing irrigation trials as a means to
accelerate tree growth in dryer areas; (2) provide tree plants to villagers
and carry out studies that should lead to appropriate actions in the rural
forestry field; and (3) introduce natural forest management techniques which
if applied successfully would increase wood yields from the natural forest
and, at the same time, provide much needed revenue for the Forestry Department.
6.02      Environmental Impact.  The impact of the project on the environment
would be substantial. Calculations show that fuelwood production from the
3,400 ha of plantations would be sufficient to forego the cutting of large
areas of bush fallow -- some 10,000 ha at the beginning of production to some
30,000 ha in later years when population pressure would have obliged farmers
to cultivate all the available land in the Bamako area. This would (a) help
to prevent soil erosion and (b) lengthen the time that land would remain under
bush fallow, thus increasing fertility generation. Under the traditional
shifting cultivation system still common in Mali, which depends heavily on
natural fertility generation through long fallow periods rather than fertil-
izer applications, longer bush fallows represent an important benefit.
B. Economic Analysis
6.03      In calculating the economic rates of return, the following assump-
tions were made:
(a) calculations were made only on the Bamako tree plantation
component in view of the experimental nature of the other
project components. For the Bamako tree plantation component,
both the direct benefits from increased wood production and
the benefits derived from longer bush fallow periods in
the form of higher crop yields (increase of 100 kg/ha of
millet production), have been calculated;
(b)  project life has been based on the average life of a Gmelina
plantation block of 24 years;
(c)  a standard conversion factor of 0.88 was used for all local
costs to express them in terms of border prices;



-- 23 -
(d)  the market wage rate of 545 MF (US$1.24) per manday has been
used for project laborers;, this is about 10% above their
average opportunity cost and reflects the general scarcity
of labor during the tree planting season; and
(e)  wood output has been valued at import substitution prices.
For fuelwood a time lag has been assumed in reaching such
prices, expressing the tinle it would take for fuelwood to
become so scarce that its price would equate import prices
in terms of energy equivalent. For timber, value assumptions
are based on actual 1978 prices of comparable hardwoods
presently imported and have been adjusted according to IBRD
price projections for 1985.
6.04      Based on the above assumptions, the estimated internal economic
rate of return on the Bamako tree plantation component is about 11%. Ex-
cluding the benefits due to longer bushfallow periods, the estimated eco-
nomic rate of return is about 9%. This, however, does not fully express
the project's importance to Mali's forestry sector: it excludes probable
values to be derived from the trials and experiments; it does not reflect
the strengthening of OAPF that would result from the project through better
financial management and increased revenues; nor does it account fully for
the environmental impact the projeclt would have, notably the prevention of
soil erosion which in the area around Bamako is shown to have strong deser-
tification effects.
6.05      Sensitivity Analysis.  Several tests were made to determine the
sensitivity of the rate of return to various alternative assumptions. With
a 10% increase in cost, the estimated rate of return would fall to 9.5%. A
delay in plantation establishment of one year without any changes in costs
would reduce the rate of return to 9.0%. Slower tree growth reducing the
benefits by 10% would reduce the rate of return to 9.3%. If benefits would
increase by 10% without any increases in costs, the rate of return would
increase to 12.2%.
6.06      Risks.  There are no known abnormal technical risks for the Bamako
tree plantation component as the Gmelina species has proved itself to be well
adapted to local conditions and to give satisfactory yields.  The results of
the pilot plantations are inherently uncertain, given the experimental nature
of these plantations.

VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances from Govern-
ment that:
(a)  consultants would be appointed on terms and conditions
and with qualifications and experiences acceptable to
the Association (paras 3.09 and 4.07);
(b)  OAPF would deposit all revenue from wood sales derived from
clearing of forest areas under the Project into a separate
account (para. 3.14);
(c) should any disbursement out of the special account fail
to meet the conditions for financing out of the proceeds
of the Credit, Government would deposit the correspond-
ing amount into that account (para 3.15);
(d)  OAPF would maintain separate accounting of the project
funds (para 3.20);
(e) the project accounts as well as the accounts of OAPF as a
whole would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA and the audited statements would be
submitted to IDA within six months after the end of the
financial year (para 3.20);
(f) the Project Director would have qualifications and
experiences acceptable to the Association (para 4.01);
(g) the Project Director would introduce a project reporting
and monitoring system (para 4.03);
(h) Government would, by the closing date, prepare a project
completion report (para 4.03);
(i) before implementing any organizational reforms during the
project implementation period, an organizational plan
together with the proposed staffing would be submitted
to the Association for approval (para 4.04);
(j) the post of Financial Director and the two posts for
Mechanics would be filled by persons with qualifications
and experiences and employed under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association (para 4.06); and
(k)  OAPF would continue to operate the project's plantations
and managed natural forests after the end of the project
period (para 5.10).



- 25 -
7.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be:
(a) a special project account: has been opened by Government
(para 3.20);
(b) the Association has been informed that all conditions
precedent to the assignment of expatriate personnel
for the first two years of the Project have been met
(para 3.13);
(c) the Association has been informed that all conditions
precedent to the disbursement to Government of the CCCE
loan have been met (para 3.13);
(d) the financing agreement between OAPF and Government
has been signed (para 3.13); and
(e) a report satisfactory to IDA on the 1978 financial
position of OAPF has been approved by the Board
of OAPF (para 3.20).
7.03      With the indicated assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.,5 million to the Government of Mali.
