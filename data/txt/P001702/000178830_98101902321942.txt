FORESTRY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:      Republic of Mali
Beneficiary:   Operation Amenagement et Productions Forestieres (OAPF)
Amount:        US$4.5 million
Terms:          Standard
Project        The project would support a five-year program aimed at increas-
Description:  ing fuelwood and building pole supplies especially for urban
areas, and at strengthening the Forestry Department of the
Ministry of Rural Development. The project would (a) establish
3,400 ha of industrial rainfed tree plantations near Bamako;
(b) establish on a trial basis 60 ha of rainfed tree planta-
tions near Segou and 70 ha of partially irrigated tree planta-
tions near Mopti; (c) apply modern forest management techniques
on a trial basis; (d) establish three rural forestry nurseries
and rehabilitate an existing one; and (e) execute studies to
investigate more efficient wood uses, to examine possibilities
to set up rural forestry activities that would generate partici-
pation by the local population and to examine the scope of a
follow-up project.
There are no apparent technical risks of an exceptional
character in the tree plantation component. The results of the
pilot plantations are inherently uncertain, given their experi-
mental nature.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A FORESTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit for the equivalent of US$4.5 million on standard IDA terms to the
Republic of Mali to help finance a proposed Forestry project. The Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC) will participate in the financing of the proposed project
with US$1.4 million and US$1.3 million, respectively. The proceeds of the
Credit and the CCCE loan would be passed on to Operation Amenagement et
Productions Forestieres (OAPF) as contributions to its capital. The terms of
the CCCE loan are to be defined in agreement with Government.   FAC would
finance the salaries of expatriate personnel at no cost to Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled an "Economic Memorandum on Mali" (1134a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 5, 1978. Its conclusions
are reflected in the following paragraphs. Country data are contained in
Annex I.
3.        With a population of about 6.3 million and a per capita GNP of
US$103 in 1976 Mali is one of the poorest countries of Africa and among the 29
least developed countries identified by the United Nations. It is handicapped
by serious obstacles to development. The extreme variability of rainfall
causes sharp fluctuations in crop and livestock production. Access to foreign
markets is made difficult by its landlocked position and the long distances -
more than 1000 km - to the nearest seaports, Abidjan and Dakar. Development
is also constrained by the substantial internal distances (the country covers
an area oi 1.24 million km2) and by the shortage of skilled manpower and the
narrow doraestic market for industrial products. About 90 percent of the popu-
lation depends for a livelihood on crop farming, animal husbandry, forestry
and fishing. Exports consist almost entirely of agricultural commodities and
livestock. The relative contribution of the primary sector to GDP declined
from 43 percent in 1972 to 37 percent in 1977.
4.        Over the fifteen years following independence economic growth has
barely kept ahead of the growth of population. During the 1960s GDP in real
terms, increased at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. During the drought
of the early seventies, GDP declined and Mali's problems were further aggra-
vated by international inflation, excessive credit expansion and growing
1/   Substantially unchanged from the President's Report for the Office du
Niger Technical Assistance/Engineering Project (Report No. P-2387-MLI).



- 2 -
budget and balance of payments deficits. The Government has initiated action
to redress major financial imbalances through credit restraint, through some
reduction of the subsidy element in the prices of essential consumer goods,
fertilizers and agricultural equipment, and through improved tax collection.
Good crop seasons in 1975, 1976 and 1977 facilitated the implementation of
these measures. However, these efforts were upset by a poor harvest in
1977/78, brought about by another drought.
The Drought Years: 1972-1974
5.        All economic sectors were in varying degrees affected by the drought
of 1972-1974, and the recovery of these sectors is following different pat-
terns. The full extent of loss of human life resulting from the drought
is not known but it was particularly severe among nomadic groups and espe-
cially the young and elderly. With respect to the cattle herd, estimated 5.5
million head in 1971, it was reduced by 15 to 20 percent.
6.        In an effort to keep essential supplies at a sufficient level
and retail prices for basic goods low, especially in urban centers, the
government resorted to large imports of cereals, only partly financed by
external aid, and to consumption subsidies. Thus cereal imports shot up from
64,000 tons in 1972 to 235,000 tons in 1974, and the resource gap widened to
nearly one-third of GDP in 1974. To finance losses incurred by state enter-
prises in charge of imports and sales of subsidized goods, growing amounts of
bank credit were used. The GDP deflator, reflecting subsidization through
officially controlled prices, increased at an annual rate of only around
5-6 percent between 1970 and 1974, although prices in the open market had
risen more steeply after the onset of the drought. Because supplies of
exports were affected by the drought, export receipts did not increse as much
as the favorable world prices would have permitted and the policy of price
containment and subsidization translated into very large external deficits.
These years, apart from imposing appalling human suffering on important
segments of the Malian population, left an unfortunate legacy on Mali's
public finances.
Uneven Recovery: 1975-1977
7.        Normal rainfall resumed in 1975 and primary production--cereals,
as well as cotton and groundnuts--increased by more than 22 percent and total
real GDP by an estimated 12.7 percent. Recovery of physical production,
however, was accompanied by a sharp rise in the GDP deflator of about 18
percent in 1975 owing to a substantial reduction in Government subsidies and
increases in the official producer prices of the major crops - ranging from 33
to 60 percent. While the resource gap was reduced it remained high, repre-
senting about 20 percent of GDP and foreign assets declined further to minus
MF 88 billion (US$184 million). Public dissaving continued to increase as
growth of revenues lagged behind rapidly rising expenditures, particularly
expenditure on personnel. The wage bill increased rapidly because of cost of



living adjustments and the policy of government to serve as employer of last
resort of nationals who complete secondary or higher education. Current
revenues did increase significantly as a result of efforts to improve tax
collection, but not enough to keep pace with rapidly growing expenditures.
The current budget deficit widened from 5.1 billion MF in 1972 to 10.5 billion
MF in 1975, or about 36 percent of total current revenues.
8.        In 1976, real growth of GDP was 5 percent.  In 1977 the situation
continued to improve, largely as a result of a good harvest, and because of
continued growth in the secondary sector (particularly on the Selingue dam),
so that GDP grew by about 7 percent in that year. However, a drought-induced
downturn in agricultural production in 1978 may mean a zero or negative growth
rate in that year.
9.        Credit expansion was reduced sharply from 1975 levels, with an
overall increase in outstanding indebtedness of the economy to deposit banks
amounting to about 20 percent in 1976, as compared with 47 percent growth rate
in 1975. However, it must be recognized that much of what is included under
"credit to the economy" in effect finances operating losses of public enter-
prises. (Whlen substantial improvements in indebtedness have taken place, such
as in 1976/77, they have largely been attributable to the export earnings of
SOMIEX, the state export monopoly.) At the beginning of 1975 the Central
Bank discount rate was raised from 3.5 to 6.0 percent with corresponding
increases in the whole set of borrowing and lending rates of deposit banks.
And a new banking law, providing for legal minimum cash reserve and liquidity
ratios has recently been promulgated. This took place within the framework of
a new monetary agreement with France in mid-1977. This agreement aims at
bringing about the conditions requisite for Mali's membership in the West
Africa Moneitary Union by 1981, imposing a very restrictive credit policy on
the operations of the Central Bank, notably in establishing more stringent
conditions on rediscount facilities, thereby precluding the financing of
operating losses of state enterprises, one of the most persistent drains on
Mali's economy.
10.       T'he balance of payments deficit in 1976 is provisionally estimated
to have declined by US$21 million to US$33.6 million. As in the past much
of the deficit was largely financed through drawings on the "operations
account" with the French Treasury. The improvement in the balance of payments
is attributable essentially to higher volume and prices of cash crop exports,
exports of foodgrains, some debt rescheduling and larger capital inflows
and higher transfer receipts. Despite this, Mali's net foreign assets have
somewhat further decreased, and at the end of 1976 were minus MF 98 billion
(US$205 million). The overall budget deficit for 1976 and 1977 was still
uncomfortably large (MF 10 billion in 1976, MF 9 billion in 1977); for 1978 a
MF 5 billion is aimed at by the Government. Given particularly that export
earnings were likely to fall during 1978, this improvement does not appear
likely.



-4-
Foreign capital and debt
11.       Public investment is mainly financed by foreign aid.  During most
of the sixties the USSR and the People's Republic of China were the most
important aid donors. At the end of 1975, they held in roughly equal propor-
tions nearly 57 percent of Mali's external public debt disbursed and out-
standing. Gross disbursements (grants and loans) from DAC sources increased
from US$24 million in 1969 to US$108 million in 1974. Roughly 60 percent came
from bilateral sources (mainly France, United States, Germany and Canada).
Since the early seventies the amount of public aid received by Mali has
increased very rapidly and grants account for most of the increase. The
average annual gross inflow of aid was less than US$20 million in early
1970-71, reached US$50 million during the first years of the drought (1972-
73), peaked at US$112 million in 1974 and has decreased only marginally since
then. Four-fifths of total aids since 1970 has been in the form of grants.
12.       Mali's external public debt outstanding at the end of 1975 (exclud-
ing drawings on the operations account with the French treasury) was US$471.0
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$144.0 million. IDA's share in
the total amount disbursed and outstanding was 18.6 percent. Repayments of
principal and interest due in 1975 would have claimed more than a quarter of
foreign exchange earnings, but actual debt service payments have been small
(2.8 percent in 1974, 3.1 percent in 1975) owing to the rescheduling since
1970 of Chinese, Russian and some other debts. However, projections indicate
that the actual debt service ratio may go up to about 19 percent by 1980
unless some further rescheduling of debt takes place. Mali received five
stand-by credits from the IMF between 1964 and 1971 which have been repaid.
Apart from the stand-by credits Mali drew SDR 5.0 million under the 1974 oil
facility and obtained another credit of SDR 3.99 million (in March 1976) under
the 1975 oil facility. In addition, Mali borrowed US$4.6 million from the IMF
trust fund facility in January 1978.
Development prospects
13.       The return of more normal weather conditions in 1975 strengthened
the economy's short run position, at least through 1977. However, the poor
harvest of 1977/78 may represent a set-back in Mali's development prospects
(especially if the drought continues during the current year) and may retard
necessary improvements in Mali's economic management. In particular, over
the medium and long term, the government must address two sets of interrelated
objectives. The first is to correct the profound financial imbalances that
have developed over the years, especially since the early seventies; the
second is to accelerate the pace of economic growth against a background
of minimal improvement in per capita income since 1960.
14.       The Government began in 1975 to tackle some of its financial prob-
lems and has been relatively successful in readjusting some key prices to
more realistic levels. Thus, incentives to agricultural production are
stronger, consumer prices more closely reflect economic costs, the burden
of subsidies has been somewhat alleviated and credit expansion has slowed



- 5 -
since official prices to producers and consumers have failed to keep pace
with rising costs. Reform of public enterprises is being undertaken but
is unavoidably a very gradual task and much remains to be done, particularly
in the area of cereals marketing. The budget is still basically unbalanced
but the government is now seriously reconsidering its employment policy with
a view to make it more selective so as to check the growth of current expendi-
ture; yet this is clearly a longer-term project. Any reconstitution of
external reserves will take some time, and in the process the Government
should progressively wean itself from using the French-financed operations
account to finance current deficits.
15.       E'rospects for real long-term growth are probably better than in
most other Sahelian countries. Agriculture has considerable potential for
expansion both in the South where rainfed agriculture meets relatively favor-
able conditions and in the vast inland delta of the Niger river. T'he river
also offers much potential for power development, particularly for industry.
Planned investment in new capacity for cotton seed oil extraction, cotton
textiles for export, and in sugar production, together with increasing crop
and livestock production, will eventually strengthen the balance of' payments.
Mineral resources (iron ore, phosphates) remain at present unexploited but may
offer interesting longer term development possibilities.
16.       'Che Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan (1974-1978)
gave high lpriority to agriculture, water and power development, industries
processing agricultural materials, and road transport. The pattern of invest-
ment was well conceived, but the overall size of the investment program,
most lately estimated at HF 826 billion (about US$1.8 billion), is proving to
be over-am'bitious. Although MF 427 billion of this total was expected to
be realized during the plan period, at the end of 1976, total investments
realized amnounted to only MF 122 billion. The problem is more one of imple-
mentation than financing; with continuing delays being encountered in project
preparation and execution, particularly in the beginning. Thus it is likely
that the overall implementation of the plan will be delayed for several
years, although no new terminal date has been set by the Mali government.
Project financing, on the other hand, is reasonably well advanced, with MF 359
billion having been received or firmly committed, and with preliminary agree-
ments obtained on another MF 100 billion. With regard to investments being
undertaken under the revised plan (revisions having been made in 1976 and
1977), priority is currently being given to food crops, while in the longer
run, greater emphasis is expected to be placed on export crops, animal hus-
bandry, minor irrigation works and more efficient manufacturing activities.
17.       The prospects for the Malian economy have improved following the
substantial increase in output over 1975-1977 and the stabilization measures
taken by the Government.  Nevertheless, sustained and viable growth in the
longer run depends crucially on investments and policy measures that will
strengthen the economy's export base, particularly in cash crops. Mali's
capacity to finance new investment, however, is severely constrained by the
limited savings potential resulting from the extremely low per capita income

level, a situation reflected in the government's budget and further compli-
cated by serious financial difficulties particularly in the public enterprise
sector. Borrowing on conventional terms would add considerably to the burden
of servicing an already sizeable external debt. External aid, accordingly,
should be on soft terms and should finance, besides foreign exchange outlays,
a significant proportion of local currency costs.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
18.       The proposed credit would be the Association's seventeenth operation
in Mali, which would bring total commitments of IDA funds to US$153.2 million.
US$78.9 million had been disbursed as of December 31, 1978. Of the sixteen
credits already approved, six have been for transport, seven for agriculture,
two for education and one for telecommunications. Agriculture represents the
largest share (46 percent) of past commitments followed by transportation (42
percent). Experience with ongoing operations has in general been satisfactory.
Notes on the execution of ongoing projects are set out in Annex II.
19.       The main objectives of Bank Group lending in Mali are:  (a) to promote
agricultural and rural development; (b) to strengthen infrastructure facili-
ties; and (c) to mobilize resources from other donors through co-financing.
These overall objectives are in line with the priorities established in the
Government's Five-Year Development Plan. The Bank Group will also continue
the ongoing dialogue with Government on economic policy issues and options in
the framework of economic and sector work. In this context Government has
recently asked that the Bank study the activities of the Office of Price
Stabilization and to provide assistance in formulating policies for employment
generation.
20.       Major agricultural and rural development projects that the Bank
Group has undertaken cover most of the country's cultivable area and benefit
the majority of farm families, who constitute 90 percent of Mali's population.
Long-term objectives aim at increasing cash crop and livestock production,
particularly for export, at increasing and stabilizing food crop production,
at achieving a redistribution of income in favor of agricultural producers, at
helping the country attain some degree of food self-sufficiency as well as
generate adequate supplies of agricultural materials for processing industries
and exports. Operations in the sector have assisted Mali in developing rice
production on the Niger flood plains for domestic consumption, groundnuts,
cotton, kenaf, rainfed cereals and livestock production. Integrated with the
agricultural aims are improvements in human health conditions, farmers'
education and training of young farmers and rural artisans. In addition,
three of the six projects financed in the transportation sector are directly
related to the rural sector.



PART III - THE FORESTRY SUBSECTOR
Resources
21.       Mali's natural vegetation consists of 6 percent Guinean savannah,
27 percent Soudanian savannah, 16 percent Sahelian steppe, 21 percent tropical
sub-desert steppe and 30 percent desert.  The forest and fauna reserves and
parks cover some four million hectares and represent about 3 percent of Mali's
total area. Man-made forests cover some 1,500 ha, planted mainly in Gmnelina
arborea, Teak, Neem (Azadarichta indica) and Eucalyptus.
22.       The forestry sub-sector accounted for only 1.9 percent of GDP in
1976 and 5.2 percent of exports in 1975 (mainly sheanuts, sheanut butter and
oil, and gumt arabic). However, natural forest savannah and bush also play an
important economic role in providing fuelwood, building poles and minor forest
products. Total fuelwood requirements are estimated at 1.7 million tons per
annum of which 17 percent are used by the urban population - nearly 80(),000
inhabitants. Building poles represent some 10 percent of total consumption.
Moreover the natural forest provides fruits, tree fodder and dry weather
grazing reserves for livestock, protects the soil against erosion, and
- as bush fallow - regenerates soil fertility under the traditional shi.fting
cultivation system.
23.       Due to the size of the country and relatively low population
densities, the cutting of fuelwood in rural areas has not generally led to
a decline in the forest cover and fuelwood is still sufficient. There are,
however, two areas in Mali where the situation is fundamentally different.
24.       First, there is an accelerating decline in the natural forest
cover around the capital city of Bamako. Rapid population growth has 'Led to
a similar growth in fuelwood consumption, at present estimated at 200,0)00 tons
annually and expected to rise to 500,000 tons by 1990. This compares with a
theoretical wood yield of 250,000 tons per year in the Bamako area but, due to
distance and difficulty of access, only about 50 percent of this is actually
being exploited. As a result, distances are getting longer, wood transport to
the city is becoming more costly, and fuelwood prices have been rising by 15%
each year on average over the past five years.
25.       Seccind, there is a noticeable decline in the natural forest
*      cover east of the Inner Delta of the Niger River; the decline is mostly
concentrated aLround the towns of Segou and Mopti and adjacent rural areas.
Although urban population levels are considerably lower here than in and
around Bamako, urban growth rates are about as rapid while fuelwood supplies
are more precarious; most of the Inner Delta is seasonally flooded and has
only a sparse forest and bush cover, and, in areas where the forest cover
is still in ex;istence, sustained wood yields are small due to slow forest
regrowth because of low rainfall (700 mm annually at Segou, and 500 mm
annually at Mopti). Moreover, the traditional fish smoking industry in the
Niger Delta area is an important additional consumer of fuelwood.

Institutions
26.       The Forestry Department under the Ministry of Rural Development
has overall responsibility for forest protection, forest products, inland
fishing, fauna conservation and wildlife management. The Ministry has,
however, delegated important functions in the forestry sector to so-called
Operations de Developpement, institutions charged to carry out specific
projects, mostly assisted by foreign aid and enjoying a considerable amount
of financial and managerial autonomy. Three such "operations" presently exist
in this sub-sector: the Forestry Management and Production Agency (OAPF), the
Mopti Fisheries Development Agency (OPM), and the Baoule Park Wildlife Manage-
ment Agency (OPNBB).
27.       OAPF was established in 1972 to set up some 18,000 ha of tree
plantations over a 30-year period to satisfy the fuel and construction wood
requirements of the main urban centers. Since then, it has rehabilitated some
300 ha of old plantations and has planted about 400 ha, mostly with a fast
growing species of Gmelina, in two forest reserves close to Bamako. Another
900 ha will be established during 1979 and 1980. Overall planting quality has
been satisfactory, and about 95 percent of all plantings have been successful.
All forest operations have been carried out by local personnel (it has a
permanent staff of about 50 employees); foreign technical assistance to date
has been minimal, limited to equipment maintenance and accounting.
28.       OAPF is at present entering a phase of rapid expansion:  it is
building a small sawmill in Bamako; it has obtained financing from Swiss
bilateral aid to establish two tree plantations and two further sawmills,
and to manage natural forests in Southern Mali; and it would be entrusted
with the execution of the proposed project. The additional activities would
require strengthening of the organization, especially in management and
administration (see para. 44).
29.       Forestry education is provided by the Katibougou Polytechnic
Institute, which delivers university trained graduates ("ingenieurs des
eaux et forets") and specialized undergraduates ("ingenieurs des travaux
forestiers"). The institute is the only forestry training school in the
Sahelian countries and, as a result, Mali has a large reservoir of well
trained forestry staff. Forestry training for field agents is provided at the
OAPF-managed Tabacoro Training Center near Bamako. The quality of training is
on the whole sufficient especially in the technical field. For key personnel
in the forestry services, however, additional training in administrative and
financial management would be beneficial.
30.       Forestry research is formally linked to the Rural Economic Institute
(IER) but has its headquarters at Katibougou. Research is presently limited
to small scale trials and its most important component, tree growing under
irrigated conditions in the inner Niger delta, has so far had unsatisfactory
results.



-9-
Objectives and Strategies
31.       The immediate priority in Mali's forestry sector is to increase the
supply of ftLelwood and building poles with regard to the main urban centers by
establishing tree plantations. This should help (a) to contain the rapid rise
in fuelwood prices, which would directly benefit lower income urban groups;
and (b) to contain and, eventually, remedy the decline of the natural forest
cover around the towns, thus preventing further environmental destruction.
Experience indicates that rainfall around Bamako (averaging 1,100 mri annually)
is sufficient to provide satisfactory wood yields for selected species under
rainfed conditions (Gmelina and Eucalyptus yielding about 9.5 m3/ha/year).  No
such experience, however, exists elsewhere in the country; while rainfed
plantations are still thought to be possible around Segou, it is believed that
around Mopti tree plantations would have to be irrigated at least dturing the
first years after planting. Pilot plantations would therefore have to be
started to obtain further data on these areas.
32.       A second priority is to devise appropriate actions in the rural
forestry field. Although the natural forest cover outside the urban areas is
not yet dec:Lining, it is expected that within ten to fifteen years, with
increased population pressures, a disequilibrium between demand and natural
supplies wi:Ll arise in more regions than has hitherto been the case., It is
therefore imperative to start testing rural forestry actions aimed at increas-
ing the supply of fuelwood and wood products close to villages, and this
with the active participation of the rural population. Activities carried out
in this fie:Ld in the past, notably the establishment of village woocl lots and
the prevention of bush fires, have been largely unsuccessful because of
disinterest on the part of the local population. Therefore such act:ions would
have to be reformulated with a view to provide sufficient incentive to the
population to participate.
33.       A third priority is the introduction of modern management techniques
in the forest reserves. The application of known techniques would have three
distinct advantages: it would substantially improve wood production while
still maintaining the forest cover; it would increase the efficiency' of for-
estry staff; and it could be expected to produce revenue from sale of wood and
wood products at least equal to the management costs.
34.       The proposed project includes components dealing with all three of
the above objectives and, in particular, emphasizes improved wood production
near the urban centers.
PART IV. THE PROJECT
35.       Following a request by Government, a Bank/FAO Cooperative Program
mission identified the project in February 1977 and a feasibility st:udy was
submitted to the Bank in March 1978. A joint IDA/CCCE mission appraised the



- 10 -
project in liaison with FAC in April-May 1978. Negotiations were held in
January 1979. The Malian delegation was led by the Minister of Rural Develop-
ment, N'Fagnanama Kone. Annex III contains supplementary project data. A
Staff Appraisal Report, "Mali Forestry Project" (No. 2148a-MLI) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Objectives
36.       The proposed project, which would be the first Bank Group financed
action in Mali's forestry subsector, would help Government to meet its main
forestry objectives: (a) improve the supply of fuelwood and building poles
to urban areas by establishing tree plantations (see para. 31); (b) promotion
of forestry techniques among the rural population (see para. 32); and (c)
management of natural forest reserves (see para. 33).
Project Description
37.       The project would be carried out over five years (1980 to 1984).
It would consist of five principal elements:
(a) the establishment of 3,400 ha of rainfed tree plantations in
two forest reserves near Bamako;
(b) the application of modern management techniques on a trial basis
over 1,000 ha of natural forest near Bamako, and 200 ha of natural
forest near Segou;
(c) the establishment, on a trial basis, of 60 ha of rainfed tree planta-
tions near Segou and of 70 ha of partially irrigated tree planta-
tions near Mopti;
(d) the establishment of three forestry nurseries at Bamako, Segou and
Mopti, and the rehabilitation of an existing one at San to provide
trees to villagers through established extension services; and
(e) the execution of studies to investigate more efficient wood uses,
to examine the set up of rural forestry activities that would
provide sufficient incentives for the population to participate
and a study to examine the scope of a possible follow-up project.
Detailed Features
38.       Bamako Rainfed Tree Plantations.  A total of 3,400 ha would be
planted mostly with Gmelina Arborea, a tropical hardwood that can be used both
for fuel and construction purposes. Works, which would be carried out on
force account by OAPF with its own equipment as well as equipment provided
under the project, include the establishment of three nurseries of 1.5 ha
each, clear felling of the natural forest followed by full destumping,
harrowing and subsoil ripping to improve the water holding capacity of the



- 11 -
soil. According to the plantation production program, one average ha of
planted Gmelina would produce a mean annual increment (m.a.i.) of 9.6 m of
wood (fuelwood and timber), which is in line with wood yields from existing
plantations. Total production 3from the Bamako rainfed plantations would
range from a total oi 90,000 m of wood for the 1981-85 period to a
maximum of 180,000 m for the period 2001-05.
39.       Natural Forest Management.  Natural forest management would be
undertaken near Bamako and Segou. It would consist of protective measures
against encroachments and bushfires, intermediate and regeneration cuttings,
complementary seeding, harrowing and weeding. Promising results have been
obtained with these techniques in Nigeria, in areas of similar rainfall
volum5 and intensity as3around Bamako, with sustained yields increasing from
0.5 m /ha/year to 1.0 m /ha/year; similar results could thus be reached
around BamaLko. No experience exists yet in areas with lower rainfall, such
as Segou, a,nd provisions are made for a careful follow up on the results 3of
both trials. However, tentative estimates would give an m.a.i. of 0.7 m per
ha around Segou.
40.       Rainfed and Irrigated Plantation Trials.  For the 60 ha pilot
rainfed pleLntation near Segou, the same techniques would be used as described
in para. 3E8. In view of the absence of planting experience and marginal
rainfall conditions in this area, three different species would be tried:
Gmelina Arborea, Eucalyptus Camaldulensis and Azadarichta Indica (Neem). Each
species would occupy about 20 ha. if managed correctly, a tentative m.a.i.
estimate could be between 3 and 4 m per ha. The 70 ha tree plantation trials
near Mopti would draw upon previous experience in the inner Niger delta. In
view of low rainfall locally, plantings would be irrigated during the first two
years to enable tree roots to reach the groundwater table.  Again, only tentative
production estimates can be made, and the m.a.i. would vary between 6 and 15 m
per ha.
41.       Rural Forestry Nurseries.  One existing rural forestry nursery (at
San) would be rehabilitated and three new ones (at Bamako, Segou and Mopti)
would be established together with the project plantation nurseries. Each
would be designed for a capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 seedlings per year.
A detailed survey would be undertaken on rural forestry possibilities (para.
42) and the results of this survey would be taken into account in project
implementation. Field training would be provided for extension workers on
rural afforestation techniques and possible approaches to encouraging the
participation of rural people.
42.       Studies and Surveys.  The project includes three studies:  (a) on
better uses of wood through preservative treatment and the use of wood burning
stoves and charcoal, and cost comparisons would be made between the various
alternatives and present methods; (b) on rural forestry possibilities: a
survey would be made in a number of villages on wood and wood product require-
ments, and on the villagers' motivation to participate in projects that would



- 12 -
satisfy such need; this studv would make proposals regarding practical actions
to be taken to promote rural forestry schemes; and (c) a feasibility study
would be made in 1983 tG examine the scope of a follow-up project from the
data gathered by a OAPF monitoring and evaluation system which would be in-
troduced under the project. It is expected that 12 man-months of consultant
services at an average cost of US$8,900 per month including contingencies (of
which salary and related benefits total US$6,300) would be needed to implement
the above studies.
Implementation
43.       The project would be implemented by OAPF under the supervision of
the Forestry Department, and the Director of OAPF would be Project Director
(Section 3.01 and 4.05 of the Credit Agreement). Ten additional forestry
engineers, graduates from the Katibougou Polytechnic Institute, would be
recruited by OAPF, most of whom would fill the positions of field sector and
subsector chiefs. Given the availability of Katibougou graduates in the
country, no difficulties are foreseen for their recruitment. The pilot opera-
tions at Segou and Mopti would be managed by OAPF field agents under the
administrative supervision of the Forestry District Inspector of the Forestry
Department at Segou and Mopti. The design and technical supervision of the
pilot operations would however be carried out with the help of consultants
(para. 46). Similarly, the rural forestry nurseries at Segou, San and Mopti
would be managed by OAPF field agents and supervised by the Forestry District
Inspector in these towns, while the nursery near Bamako would be fully under
OAPF authority.
44.       The Project Director would be responsible for introducing a project
monitoring and reporting system with the assistance of consultants. Govern-
ment would prepare a completion report promptly after the project completion
date. Any organizational changes in OAPF during project implementation should
be submitted to the Association for approval (Sections 3.04(b) and (c), and
4.06 of the Credit Agreement.)
Expatriate Staff
45.       A Financial Director for OAPF would be appointed to provide OAPF
with financial management and accounting information and to strengthen the
administration and finance division as well as provide in-service training
to its members. Two mechanics would be employed to manage the central OAPF
workshop at Bamako and two equipment maintenance units that would be estab-
lished in the field. As persons with the desired qualifications for these
three positions are not available in the country, they would be recruited
internationally and serve over the full five years of the implementation
period at a total cost, excluding contingencies, of US$9,500 per working month
for the Financial Director (of which salary and related benefits are US$5,700)
and US$7,700 for the mechanics (of which salary and related benefits are
US$4,000).



- 13 -
Consultant Services
46.       In addition to the 12 man-months of consultant services needed to
implement the studies indicated in para. 42, provisions have been. made under
the project for 27 man-months of consultant services at an average cost of
US$8,900 per month excluding contingencies to implement other components of
the project   (salary and related benefits are US$6,300).  Of these 27 man-
months, 12 man-months, ranging from two to four man-months per year over four
years, are necessary to design and supervise the irrigated pilot plantation
at Mopti; the supervision would include in the last project year (1984) an
in-depth analysis of the results obtained.  The remaining fifteen man-months
have been retained (1) to monitor the tree plantation and natural forest
management techniques that will be applied in the forest reserves close
to Bamako and Segou; (2) to examine the feasibility of using different tree
species for planting; and (3) to set up a monitoring and evaluation program
and supervise its initial implementation by the field works division of OAPF.
(Section 3.02 of the Credit Agreement.)
Training
47.       As specialized training in forestry techniques is already provided
at Katibougou, and a Swiss aid project includes a large component for training
forestry field agents at the Tabacoro Center, training under the proposed
project would be limited to practical in-service training by the OAPF expa-
triate staff in equipment maintenance and financial management, and by
consultants in tree plantation techniques and natural forest management.
Furthermore, US$57,000, excluding contingencies, has been included in the
project to provide complementary training for OAPF key personnel.
Cost Estimates
48.       Total project costs over the five-year period are estimated at
US$9.4 million net of taxes, of which the foreign exchange component would be
US$6.4 million or 68 percent. Government has decided to waive any identi-
fiable taxes and duties. Cost estimates are based on prices and quotes
obtained during appraisal and include physical contingencies amounting to 10
percent of base cost estimates on all categories except personnel costs.
Expected price increases which are being applied range from 6 percent to 7.5
percent p.a. per category over the project implementation period. Project
costs are summarized in the Credit and Project Summary, page (ii) above.
Financing. Plan
49.       The proposed IDA credit of US$4.5 million would cover 48 percent of
total project cost. FAC and CCCE have indicated their agreement l:o partici-
pate in the financing of the proposed project. FAC would contribute US$1.3
million and CCCE US$1.4 million, while the Government of Mali would cover the
remaining cost of US$2.2 million. Of this amount MF 180 million (US$0.4 mil-
lion) would be directly appropriated from the national budget to pay the



- 14 -
salaries of civil service staff seconded to OAPF and the remainder would
come from revenue accruing to OAPF from wood sales, which derive from the
clearing of forest areas in preparation of plantation establishment. OAPF
would deposit all such revenues into a separate account. FAC would finance
the salaries of expatriate personnel at no cost to Government. The CCCE
loan, the terms of which are to be defined between Government and CCCE, and
the IDA credit would be added by Government to the present OAPF capital.
Fulfillment of conditions preceding initial disbursement of the CCCE loan and
assignment of expatriate personnel for the first two years of project exe-
cution by FAC, and the conclusion of a financial agreement satisfactory to the
Association between Government and OAPF would be conditions of effectiveness.
(Sections 4.04 and 6.01(b)-(d) of the Credit Agreement.)
Establishment of a revolving fund
50.       Expenditures to be financed in the first project year (1980) would
total some MF 825 million (about US$1.9 million) including contingencies.
Assuming a lag of four months between the time the expenditure is incurred
and the time it is reimbursed, and taking into account that machinery and
equipment will probably be financed by direct payments to the supplier or by
letters of credit, the interim financing requirements would be MF 110 million
(US$0.25 million). OAPF and Government would be unable to provide such
timely advance financing. Therefore, the Association and CCCE will make a
joint initial disbursement of US$0.25 million immediately after effectiveness
of the respective credit and loan agreements into the special account. The
opening of the special account would be a condition of effectiveness of the
Credit. The advance would serve to set up a revolving fund which would
finance project expenditures and would be replenished upon satisfactory
evidence that such expenditures were eligible for financing out of the pro-
ceeds of the credit. The respective contributions of IDA and CCCE to the
revolving fund would be 70 percent and 30 percent. (Sections 2.02(b) and (c),
and 6.01(a) of the Credit Agreement.)
Accounts and Audit
51.       Although OAPF keeps its regular revenue and expenditure accounts
up to date, management has little knowledge of its financial position through
the year. To remedy the situation, FAC has agreed to a request from OAPF to
send two financial assistance missions which would help (1) to review OAPF's
accounting system; (2) to prepare a balance sheet and profit and loss state-
ment for the agency as of December 31, 1978; and (3) to prepare a budget for
the agency for 1979. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit that the final report is satisfactory to the Association, and that it
has been approved by the Board of OAPF. OAPF would maintain separate project
accounts; project accounts as well as the accounts of OAPF as a whole would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association; and
the audited statements would be submitted to the Association within six months
after the end of the financial year. The employment of independent auditors
would be financed out of the proceeds of the IDA Credit. (Sections 4.01,
4.02(a) and (b), 6.01(e) of the Credit Agreement).



- 15 -
52.        Contracts for machinery and vehicles (US$1.6 million excluding
contingencies), to be financed jointly by the Association and CCCE would be
awarded oni the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the AssociLation guidelines. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed
a preference of 15 percent or the level of import duties, whichevetr is lower.
Contracts for the construction of houses, offices and workshops (ULS$0.6
million exccluding contingencies) would not be attractive to interrLational
contractors, and would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding adver-
tised locially in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Associa-
tion.  For contracts of less than US$20,000, local shopping on the basis of
several quotations would be acceptable.
Disbursements
53.        The IDA credit would be disbursed during 1980-1984 as follows:
(a) 60 percent of total costs of plantation establishment, forest management
and rural nurseries (US$3.0 million); (b) 100 percent of total costs of
consultant services, expert services (except salaries), audits andl training
(US$0.8 million); and (c) an initial disbursement of US$0.2 million and an
unallocatied sum of US$0.5 million.
Benefits and Risks
54.        Applications for credit withdrawal would be fully documented for
vehicles and equipment as well as for expatriate staff, consultants and
training, and certificates of expenditures would be required for other expendi-
tures related to plantation establishment, forest management and rural nur-
series. In the latter case, accounts would be kept and controlled by the
Financial Director who would retain documentation supporting these certificates
of expenditure for inspection by supervision missions and externa:L audits.
55.        The project would generate direct benefits through increased planta-
tion wood production. It would also lay the groundwork for future investment
decisions in the forestry sector as it would: (1) provide information on sus-
tained wood yields and introducing irrigation trials as a means to accelerate
tree growth in dryer areas; (2) provide tree plants to villagers and carry out
studies that should lead to appropriate actions in the rural forestry field;
and (3) introduce natural forest management techniques which if applied
successfully would increase wood yields from the natural forest and, at the
same time, provide much needed revenue for the Forestry Department.
56.        The impact of the project on the environment would be substantial.
It is expected that fuelwood production from the 3,400 ha of Bamako rainfed
*            tree plantations would be sufficient to forego the cutting of some 10,000
ha of bush fallow at the beginning of production to some 30,000 ha in later
years. This would (a) help to prevent soil erosion and (b) lengtlhen the time
that land would remain under bush fallow, thus increasing fertility regenera-
tion. Under the traditional shifting cutlivation system still common in Mali,
which depends heavily on natural fertility generation through long fallow
period rather than fertilizer applications, longer bush fallows represent an
important benefit to farmers.



- 16 -
57.       The estimated economic rate of return of the Bamako rainfed tree
plantation component (85 percent of total project costs) is 11 percent
including benefits due to longer bush fallow periods and 9 percent excluding
these benefits. Calculations were made only on this component in view of the
experimental nature of the other project components. The figure does not,
however, fully reflect the project's importance to Mali's forestry sector; it
excludes value to be derived from the trials and experiments; it does not
reflect the strengthening of OAPF through better financial management and
increased revenues; nor does it account fully for the environmental impact the
project would have, notably the prevention of soil erosion which in the area
around Bamako is shown to have strong desertification effects.
58.       There are no known exceptional technical risks for the Bamako
plantations component as the Gmelina species has proved itself to be well
adapted to local conditions and to give satisfactory yields. The results of
the pilot plantations are uncertain, given their experimental nature.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Mali and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
60.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) the opening of a special account (Section 6.01(a) of
the Credit Agreement and para. 50 above);
(b) fulfillment of conditions preceding disbursement of the
CCCE loan and assignment of expatriate personnel for the
first two years of the project by FAC, and signing of
the financing agreement between OAPF and Government
(Section 6.01(b), (c) and (d) of the Credit Agreement
and para. 49 above); and
(c) a report, satisfactory to the Association, on the financial
position of OAPF as at December 31, 1978, has been approved
by the Board of Directors of OAPF (Section 6.01 (e) of the
Credit Agreement and para. 51 above).
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

Credit 277-MLI       Mopti Rice Development Project.  US$9.5 million Credit of
January 6, 1972 (as amended on April 11, 1975); Effective
Date: June 26, 1972; Closing Date: May 31, 1978 extended
to September 30, 1979.
Development in the first two years was hampered by the droughts of
1972/73 and 1973/74 which brough very low flood levels. In the following three
years development of irrigable areas, of yields, total production and marketed
production followed revised appraisal estimates fairly closely, but the project
experienced another year of exceptionally low flood levels and deficient rains
in 1977/78. On December 31, 1978, 98 percent of the Credit have been disbursed.
Arrangements have been made for a smooth transition to the Second Mopti Rice
Project.
Credit 321-MLI       Telecommunications Project.  US$3.6 million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: April 4, 1973; Closing
Date: July 1, 1976 extended to June 30, 1979.
Following substantial cost overruns and lack of financial resources
in the country, the Credit Agreement was amended in 1976 to execute the
project in two phases. The first phase is progressing satisfactorily and the
main project components are nearing completion. The second phase could be
part of a future investment program. A new General Manager has the situation
well in hand and the new trend is encouraging for the fulfillment of the
institution-building objectives of the project. Financial performance
is expected to improve as capacity increases on commissioning of IDA and
Algerian-financed investments.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 383--MLI      Second Highway Project.  US$17.8 million Credi: of
May 23, 1973 (as amended on June 12, 1975); Effective
Date: September 12, 1973; Closing Date: July 15, 1977
extended to July 15, 1979.
The Project consists of (a) reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou
(222 km) and Bamako-Bougouni (167 km) roads; (b) procurement of highway
equipment; (c) technical assistance to DPW; (d) preinvestment studies for
the Bamako-Kolokani road; and (e) a study of the trucking industry. Recon-
struction of the Bamako-Bougouni road, which was to be financed by USAID,
was limited to reconstruction of a bridge and access roads because the bids
were too high. Available USAID funds were used to procure additional highway
equipment and spare parts. All project components, except for reconstruction
of the Faladie-Segou road which is expected to be completed by June 1979,
have been completed.
Credit 420-MLI       First Education Project.  US$5.0 million Credit of
July 11, 1973; Effective Date: November 15, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The physical implementation of the project is about 14 months behind
schedule, mainly due to slow progress by contractors. Construction of the
Technical/Vocational Institute and three of the science blocks was completed
in December 1978; the remaining science blocks are expected to be completed by
March 1979. The programs of the Technical/Vocational Institute, designed to
meet local manpower needs, are being prepared with technical assistance
financed under the project and should be ready for the next academic year.
the project is well managed and is expected to be completed by the end
of 1979, about one year behind the appraisal estimate.
Credit 538-MLI       Livestock Project.  US$3.3 million Credit of
April 11, 1975; Effective Date: July 24, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project is a broad-based effort to improve livestock production
in Mali's fifth region and includes the management of a grazing scheme,
reinforcement of animal health services, development of stock watering facili-
ties, livestock markets, an abattoir and a trial station as well as a training
and functional literacy program and the preparation of a follow-up project.
Overall progress in project implementation has been disappointing. The grazing
scheme has not yet been inaugurated, the veterinary service has been neglected
and cost overruns have created doubt as to whether the objectives of the
project can be fully met. Actions are however being proposed to improve
management, which if successful could still redress the present situation.
Credit 599-MLI       Third Highway Project.  US$10.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project comprises (a) improvement of feeder roads; (b) execution
of backlog maintenance on paved roads; (c) procurement of spare parts and

equipment for workshops and the training center; and (d) technical assistance
and consulting services for (i) the training center, (ii) a transport plan
study, and (iii) the detailed engineering for the Bamako-Bougouni road (167
km). Construction of feeder roads and the backlog maintenance program is
underway. All spare parts and equipment for the workshops and the training
center have been delivered. Courses at the training center are proceeding
regularly. The transport plan study began in April 1977 with the participa-
tion of Malian specialists.
Credit 669-MLI       Mali-Sud Agricultural Project.  US$15.5 million Credit
of December 23, 1976; Effective Date: September 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project was signed year-end 1976, but administrative reasons
delayed effectiveness until September 1977. For this reason capital invest-
ments and a number of specific project activities were delayed. However, the
project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit 713-MLI       Third Railway Project.  US$10.5 million Credit of
June 10, 1977; Effective Date: November 22, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Though a three month delay in effectiveness caused some slippage
in the start up of the Project, Government and the Railway are doing their
making up for the lost time. The efficiency shown by the Railway in imple-
mentation leads us to believe that the Project will be implemented smoothly.
Contracts already signed and quotations received remain within appraisal
estimates. Thanks to strict financial control, the Railway is achieving a
better than expected financial performance.
Credit 733-MLI       Second Education Project.  US$10.0 million Credit of
September 30, 1977; Effective Date: January 30, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The physical implementation of the project is about ten months
behind schedule, for the following reasons: the site for the National Manage-
ment Institute is not yet decided, and the programs for the rural education
centers and the livestock technician training center are not yet completed.
These programs will determine the type of construction needed. Implementation
of the educational components is progressing satisfactorily. Project manage-
ment continues to be satisfactory.
Credit 753-MLI       Mopti Rice II Project.  US$15.0 million Credit of
December 8, 1977; Effective Date: May 15, 1978;
Closing Date: November 30, 1983.
The project aims at the consolidation of the first project and
at moderate expansion in the area. Transition has been smooth and preparation
of works is proceeding on schedule. All contracts for works and services have
been concluded and technical assistance is being recruited.

Project: US$4.0 million Credit of October 30,
1978; Effective Date: March 30, 1979; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982.
The project comprises a three-year program of technical assistance
and a pilot program of rehabilitation works.  Other project components include
support for agricultural research and trial programs, an aerial photographic
survey, a socio-economic study of the settler population, an audit of the
Office du Niger accounts, and training scholarships for Malian engineers. So
far, all actions have been taken to implement the project on schedule.
