PAPUA NEW GUINEA
THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Independent State of Papua New Guinea
Beneficiary:      Agriculture Bank of Papua New Guinea (ABPNG)
Loan Amount:      US$18.8 million equivalent
Terms:            Repayment in 16 years including 7 years of grace at the
standard variable rate.
Relending
Terms:          The Government of Papua New Guinea (GOPNG) would relend the
proceeds of the proposed loan to ABPNG at a fixed interest
rate of 3% p.a. for a period of 16 years including seven
years of grace, and bear the foreign exchange and interest
rate risks. ABPNG would onlend the loan proceeds to its
subborrowers at interest rates ranging from 5% to 20% p.a.
with variable repayment terms depending on the activities
being financed.
Project
Description:   The project aims at increasing and broadening the agricul-
tural exports of Papua New Guinea (PNG), providing a better
livelihood for rural families, and gradually strengthening
ABPNG as a development finance institution. The project
would: (a) provide funds to ABPNG to onlend for tree crop
development, new crops and other agricultural activities,
livestock, and agro-processing facilities and agricultural
equipment and vehicles; and (b) strengthen ABPNG by pro-
viding data processing facilities, vehicles, funds for staff
training, fellowships, studies, and technical assistance for
improving its management and financial performance. The
project's benefits include an increase in PNG's annual
exports of tree crops by about US$21.5 million, improvement
in the standard of living of about 3,400 smallholder
families and gradual expansion of ABPNG's lending
capability. The primary project risk is ABPNG's capability
to implement the project adequately in view of its
organizational problems (e.g., shortage of qualified staff,
lack of planning and inadequate financial control). To
minimize this risks, the project stresses the institutional
development of ABPNG through an Action Program and Financial
Strategy, technical assistance and staff training. With
these safeguards, the risk is acceptable.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      Introduction. The Government of Papua New Guinea (GOPNG) has
requested Bank assistance for a project to expand and improve the supply of
term credit to smallholders available through the Agriculture Bank of Papua
New Guinea (ABPNG). The project, a follow-on to the Second Agricultural
Credit Project (Cr. 1149-PNG), was identified by the Government in May 1982
and prepared by the Government with Bank assistance. The project was
appraised in May 1983 but processing was suspended following a GOPNG decision
to restructure the implementing agency and its interest rate policy. As a
result of intensive policy discussions between the Government and the Bank,
and significant improvement in ABPNG's performance, the project was
reappraised in February/March 1985. The proposed project would help establish
an appropriate policy framework for deveLopment of a financially sound rural
credit market in the country and strengthen ABPNG as a development finance
institution.
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.02      Agriculture plays a dominant role in the economy of Papua New Guinea
(PNG) as employer and provider of food and income to the great majority (about
85%) of PNG's population. The sector, including forestry, fisheries and
livestock, accounted for more than 40% of PNG's K 687 million of exports in
1983 and about a third of its GDP. PNG has a humid tropical climate which is
conducive to agricultural production, especially of tree crops. The land area
of 461,700 km' is sparsely populated (an average of 7 persons per k2) and
nearly 150,000 km2 (30Z) is topographically, geologically and climatically
suited to agriculture. With only about half of this suitable land currently
used for agriculture, there is considerable scope for increased utilization.
1.03      Agriculture in PNG follows three modes of production:  (a) small-
holder subsistence farming based mainly on root crops and vegetables for
farmers' own consunption; (b) estates which hire labor and produce mainly tree
crops for export; and (c) smallholders growing cash crops, mainly tree crops
for export, in addition to some food crops. Estimates of subsistence output
are weak, although such output is believed to comprise about 40Z of total
agricultural production. Subsistence agriculture is suited to remote areas
where poor infrastructure hinders trading activity; its importance is expected
to decline gradually as infrastructural improvements permit trading at lower
cost, and thereby encourage greater cultivation of tree crops. Tree crop
products already account for about 40X of agricultural production, and over
77Z of agricultural exports.

The Tree Crop Subsector
1.04      Tree crops cover about 476,000 ha (1Z) of land in PNG, __! which
about 55Z is under coconut; 27Z, cocoa; and 182, other tree crops. About 652
of the area is managed by smallholders, and 352 by estates. Production from
major tree crops during 1983 is_shown below:

1.05      Between 1978 and 1983, the volume of tree crop production increased
by 4% p.a., mainly due to increases in oil palm and coffee. Most other tree
crops have shown a declining trend. Slow growth coupled with reduction in
commodity prices since 1978 has resulted in stagnation of export values (Table
1.2). The performance and prospects of major tree crops in PNC are discussed
below.

1.06      Coffee.  Coffee is the most important tree crop, accounting for
almost half of PNG's tree crop export value. About 86X of the 47,000 ha
coffee area is cultivated by smallholders. Most of the coffee (95Z) is grown
in the Highlands area which is the most densely populated and economically
depressed area in PNG. PNG is a member of the International Coffee Agreement
(ICA), and in the past its ezport quota under the ICA has been below 70 of
its production. Since local consumption is low (5Z), a substantial proportion
of production (over 25Z) had to be ezported to non-ICA cbuntries at discounted
prices. More recently, however, a reduction in 1984 production to about
45,000 tons compared with 1983 production of about 52,500 tons and a policy
change in favor of higher buffer stocks have eliminated non-quota sales in
1985. Production forecasts based on current plantings show a decline due to
early plant senility and associated disease susceptibility. About 2Z of PNG's
total coffee area needs to be replanted/rehabilitated per year in order to
maintain its current average production level of about 50,000 tons.
1.07      Cocoa.  The cocoa area at 128,000 ha is more extensive than that of
coffee, but production volume and value are lower so that cocoa accounts for
only about 19Z of the value of tree crop exports. While the majority (57Z) of
the cocoa area is cultivated by smallholders, plantations also cover a sub-
stantial area (some 55,000 ha). Cocoa production has declined by about 20%
since its peak production of about 35,000 tons in 1974/75 due to tree
Senility, pests and diseases, and current low average yields of about 0.3
tons/ha. However, locally selected disease-resistant varieties are now
available and, given good management, the prospects for increasing cocoa
yields are excellent.
1.08      Coconut.  Copra production is PNG's longest established industry but
now accounts for only 15X of tree crop exports. About 64Z of the 263,000 ha
coconut area is under smallholder management. Copra yields are variable but
average about 0.7 tons per ha. Increased yields are now possible through the
utilization of hybrid planting material.
1.09      Oil Palm.  Oil palm is grown and processed on a commercial scale at
Cape Hoskins (13,200 ha) and Biala (6,100 ha) in West New Britain Province,
and at Popondetta (9,400 ha) in Oro Province. Of the total 28,700 ha of oil
palm, about 58Z is managed by smallholders. Production and export of palm
products have grown at an average annual rate of more than 20Z from 32,600
tons in 1978 to 87,000 tons in 1983 giving oil palm the highest growth rate
relative to other crops in PNG. This is due to its higher profitability, a
result of high yields and good market demand.
1.10      Tea and Rubber.  PNG also has small areas of rubber (6,500 hAm' and
tea (2,800 ha). Low annual rubber yields (0.6 ton per ha) from aging trees,
high labor costs and recent depressed prices have led te declines in the
rubber area and production. The tea industry in PNG is also small and
declining. Tea is even more labor-intensive than rubber, requiring very
careful harvesting techniques. Declining real prices coupled with high labor
costs make tea production less attractive than other tree crops. While
production increases from existing tea areas are possible, it is unlikely that
any new project will be started.



-4-
Piggery and Poultry
1.11      Pigs and chickens have traditionally been part of the subsistence
farming systems of PNG smallholders and are gaining increasing importance in
the commercial sector as well. It is estimated that the non-indigenous
livestock resource consists of 1.5 million pigs and 1.5 million poultry
dispersed widely throughout the country. About 99Z of pigs and 75% of poultry
are reared by smallhoLders. Recent growth performance of these industries has
been strong as indicated by a 25% annual growth rate for poultry and 13% for
pigs over the last five years. Future growth will be Limited to expansion of
local consumption which is expected to be about 82 per year.
B. Agricultural Development Objectives and Strategy
1.12      The main goals of the Cover-Lment's agricultural development policies
are: to improve the livelihood of rural families, to increase and broaden
agricultural exports, and to reduce food imports. During the last decade, the
Government's agricultural and rural development strategy has focused on:
(a) an open economy with emphasis on a strong private sector supported by
agricultural credit and export crop stabilization funds; (b) the support of
clans and other traditional groups as recognized legal entities while acknow-
ledging individual land rights in clan lands as a basis for long-term farm
improvements; (c) the delegation of major development responsibilities to the
provincial level; (d) financial and management assistance to nationals to
enable them -o assume responsibility for plantations formerly owned and man-
aged by expatriates; and (e) expansion of specialized agricultural training
and improvements in the remuneration and working conditions of agricultural
support staff.
1.13      Recently, the Government has shorn renewed awareness that agricul-
ture will remain the mainstay of PNG's economy for many years. This recogni-
tion is manifested in the greater flexibility of Government regarding expatri-
ate ownership and management of plantations, in the formulation of a medium-
term development strategy, and in its efforts to improve agricultural services
such as research, extension and credit.
C. World Bank Experience with Past Lending
1.14      Since the country's independence in 1975, the World Bank has suppor-
ted agricultural development in PNG through six projects: (a) the Popondetta
Smallholder Oil Palm Development Project (Ln. 1333-PNG); (b) Southern High-
lands Rural Development (Cr. 841-PNG); (c) Enga Provincial Development
(Ln. 2125/Cr. 1227-FNG); (d) West Sepik Provincial Development
(Ln. 2475-0-PNG); (e) Agricultural Support Services Project (Ln. 2276-PNG);
(f) Second Agricultural Credit Project (Cr. 1149-PNG) and (g) Nucleus Estate
and Smallholder I Project (Ln. 2608-PNG). In addition, Agriculture Credit I
(Cr. 348) provided assistance for the development of smallholder beef, pig and
poultry enterprises through loans by the Papua New Guinea Development Bank
(PNGDB) (now ABPNG) prior to PNG's independence.



1.15      The Popondetta project assists in the development of 4-ha oil palm
blocks for 1,400 smallholders, together with investments in infrastructure,
extension and inspection services and a transport company for the smallholder
production. The Southern Highlands, Enga, and West Sepik Projects assist
integrated rural development efforts in three of PNG's least developed pro-
vinces. The Agricultural Support Services Project aims to strengthen PNG's
agricultural support services in the areas of research, education and train-
ing, extension services, sector planning, agricultural project development,
and regulatory services. The Nucleus Estate and Smallholder I Project would
develop oil palm and cocoa in Milne Bay Province. A PPAR (Report No. 3997) of
June 23, 1982 on Agriculture Credit I emphasized the need for: (a) expert
technical and financial management; (b) the concentration of pig and poultry
production in integrated firms; and (c) the clarification of the roles of the
Department of Primary Industry (DPI) and PNCDB.
1.16      The Second Agricultural Credit Project (SDR 12.3 million), which
financed a share of ABPNG's lending for tree crop development and other
agricultural subprojects, was completed on December 30, 1984, and the funds
have been fully disbursed. In the course of project implementation, three
main lessons were learned:
(a) ABPNG's supervision of the private management agencies which assist
smallholders to carry out subpro,ect activities should be
strengthened to ensure successful subproject implementation.
(b)  Budgeting and programming of loan and investment operations at ABPNG
need to be improved so that loan approvals and disbursements are in
line with available funds, and subloan disbursements are not
delayed.
(c) A systematic arrears management program for A3UNG is required to
identify problem areas, define a necessary course of action for
dealing with the arrears, and improve collection and financial
performance.
These lessons are reflected in the design of the proposed project.
II. AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND THE AGRICULTURE BANK OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
A. Financial Sector Overview
2.01      PNG's financial sector is young and underdeveloped with a clientele
who are relatively new entrants to the cash economy and the credit market. It
operates within a physical environment which is geographically fragmented
giving rise to numerous isolated communities which are separated from one
another by physical, linguistic and cultural barriers. This natural and human
diversity poses considerable problems for administration in general, and for
specific functions such as agricultural credit and extension.

2.02      Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG).  BPNC is the country's central
bank. It is the sole issuer of legal currency in PNG, acts as a banker to
Government and the commercial banks, and administers the nation's interna-
tional reserves and foreign exchange rules and regulations. It regulates the
country's six commercial banks, 114 savings and loan societies (only 39 of
which are active), four finance companies and one merchant bank. BPNG con-
trols interest rates of the commercial banks and influences the volume of
credit and investment through its normal rediscounting facilities and by
stipulating the liquid asset requirements that commercial banks must observe,
currently set at 18Z. BPNG acts as a lender-of-last-resort if the banks have
a shortage of liquidity, and operates special rediscount facilities to
encourage investment in specific areas. In agriculture, for example, BPNG
established an Agricultural Export Development Facility on December 2, 1981,
under which BPNG lent a total of K 15 million to the commercial banks at a
rate of 8X p.a. The banks then onlent to appropriate (large-scale) borrowers
at a rate of 11 p.a. for redevelopment of plantations producing export
crops. The entire K 15 million was committed during 1982 and drawdowns
amounted to K 7.6 million as of August. 30, 1984. This scheme was succeeded in
1983 by the Agricultural Export Development Scheme which was aiso aimed at
plantation redevelopment. The commercial banks lend their own funds (rather
than funds advanced by BPNG) up to a maximum of [ 15 million at rates approved
by the Department of Finance. The banks then receive a 3% interest rate sub-
sidy from the Government on approved loans. The subsidy allows the borrower
to obtain funds at 3Z less than he otherwise would pay. About K 6.0 million
in loans were approved in the first 21 months after the scheme's introduction,
with interest rates at the prime lending rate, maturity of 7-8 years, and no
grace period. The current prime lending-rate in PNG is 12-12.25%. A previous
minimum saviL.gs rate on passbook accounts has been abolished and as a result
the passbook rate has declined from the 8% minimum in September 1983 to 3-6%
today. A summary of interest rates is given below.

2.03      CommerciaL Banks. With the excepLion of the Papua New Guinea
Banking Corporation (PNGBC), all coumercial banks are subsidiaries of foreign
banks. PNGBC is wholly owned by the Government and holds slightly more than
50% of the assets of the commercial banking system. Loans made by foreign
banks in the agricuLture sector have been largely related to agricultural
export financing. Government policy for the commercial banks has recently
been geared to encourage more mediur- and long-term loans for agro-based
industry and to expand term lending in the agricultural sector.  PNGBC
presently makes 5 to 8-year term loans for rehabilitation/development of
coffee, cocoa, coconut, tea, palm oil, cattle raising, etc., to both nationals
and expatriates. PNGBC's agricultural loans currently bear interest rates of
11.25X to 14.25% p.a.
2.04      Financial Markets.  In recent years, the Government has taken steps
to develop financiaL markets in PIG. A treasury bill auction system has been
operating since August 1980 and there are Government inscribed stock offerings
(i.e., long-term bonds) at rates of about 10.25-12.25%. However, there is



- 8 -
little participation in these issues other than by commercial banks and super-
annuation funds. The Government securities market is still underdeveloped and
there is no real short-term money market. The first public stock offering of
a bank stock met with only limited success, and bonds or debentures to raise
business funds are practically nonexistent.
B. Agricultural Investment and Lending
2.05      Foreign investment in agriculture is encouraged through the National
Investment and Development Authority (NIDA) which was established in 1974.
Large-scale local investors are assisted by the National Investor Scheme which
has committed about two thirds of its fundc to agricultural and forestry pro-
jects. In addition, the Investment Corporation of Papua New Guinea (ICPNG)
was created in 1971 to take up equity investments and make them available to
PNG nationals through its Investment Corporation Fund (ICF). The largest
single lender for agriculture is the Agriculture Bank of Papua New Guinea
(ABPNG) which is the onLy financial institution providing credit to small
rural farmers and small agricultural business groups. ABPNG accounts for the
major portion of long-term investments in agriculture through its loans for
coffee, cocoa, oil palm, rubber, and livestock development. Its contribution
to value added and exports is estimated to be an average of about US$45
million and US$47 million p.a., respectively.
C. Agriculture Bank of Papua New Guinea
2.06      Legal Framework and Scope of Operations.  ABPNG, originally called
the PNG Development Bank, was established by the Development Bank Act of 1965
as a multipurpose, wholly Government-owned development finance institution.
In February 1985, the Government renamed the bank and directed it to orient
its lending operations essentially for agricuLture, and imposed a 20% ceiling
on the proportion of the loan portfolio to be devoted to commercial and
industrial projects. Although ABPNG is under the general supervision of the
Minister of Finance, it is autonomous and lies outside the administrative or
operational control of the Department of Finance with regard to policy
decisions and day-to-day operations. ABPNG is authorized to grant loans;
acquire, develop, and manage property for sale or lease; form subsidiaries or
promote companies or enterprises in any manner permitted by law; receive
deposits from the public; issue securities or debentures; underwrite loans and
capital issues; provide guarantees; and invest in shares or own capital
interests. All ABPNG liabilities are guaranteed by the Government as to their
repayment.
2.07      Organization and Management.  ABPNG is managed and controlled by a
Board of Directors consisting of the Managing and Deputy Managing Directors,
the Secretary of the Department of Finance and nine members appointed by the
Minister of Finance from the Government and the private sector. The Board
decides the policies and direction of ABPNG operations and approves major
loans (over K 250,000) and equity investments. The Chief Executive Officer is
the Managing Director (a PNG national) appointed by the National Executive
Council (the Cabinet) upon recommendation of the Minister of Finance for a
maximum term of 7 years. The incumbent Managing Director has had a long
career in civil service prior to joining ABPNG and the departmental managers



- 9 -
are long-standing employees of the Bank. The position of Deputy Managing
Director is now vacant but would be filled under the technical assistance
component of the proposed project. A condition of effectiveness would be the
appointment of a suitably qualified individual as Deputy Managing Director.
2.08      ABPNG's head office in Port Moresby is organized into four depart-
ments: Operations, Technical, Accounting and Finance, and Administration and
Personnel. An Organization Chart of ABPNG is provided in Annex 2. The
Operations Department is in charge of all lending and investment operations,
and as such is responsible for appraisal, loan processing, approval and
supervision. The Technical Department is charged with providing support to
the Operations Department in evaluating the technical viability of projects
particularly agriculture. All new lending areas are assessed by this Depart-
ment before they are generally accepted. Larger projects are evaluated and
monitored and the Department is responsible for supervision and monitoring of
equity investment. The Accounting and Finance Department has responsibility
for all aspects of ABPNG's accounting operations including its borrower
accounts. The Administration and Personnel Department is responsible for all
personnel, training and property matters. Two units report directly to the
Managing Director - Economics and Audit and Inspection. The Economics Unit is
in charge of monitoring development trends, reporting of loan statistics,
liaison with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, and corpo-
rate planning. The primary functions of the Audit and Inspection Unit are to
review accounting, financial and other operational activities of ABPNG and
ensure the adequacy of its internal controls. The Computer Operations Unit
which reports directly to the Deputy Managing Director is responsible for data
recording, analysis and reporting as well as development and maintenance of
computer hardware and software equipment.
2.09      In early 1984, ABPNG reorganized its branch network into four
regional offices at Port Moresby, Lae, Rabaul and Mt. Hagen. In turn, these
supervise the six branches, three sub-branches and five representative
offices. The objectives of the reorganization were to reduce administrative
costs, streamline branch operations and make them field oriented. All loan
and general administration activities (documentation, securities, loan
accounting, statistics, property management, etc.) are centralized in the
regional offices. Technical personnel in the regional offices and branches
then concentrate on promotion of the bank's services, inspecting prospective
borrowers' sites and projects, supervising loans, and collection and arrears
control. The results of the reorganization have so far been encouraging. The
field personnel are able to maintain frontline contact with the borrowers
while loan supervision and arrears control have improved. The regionalization
of branches facilitates loan approval and disbursement, strengthens technical
expertise in the field, promotes a good bank-borrower relationship, and
expands the bank's outreach.
2.10      Staff and Training. ABPNG has a staff of 334, comprising 131
professionals (21 expatriates) and 203 support staff. Almost half the staff
are in the head office. Due to scarce trained manpower in PNG and high turn-
over of national and expatriate staff, ABPNG is inadequately staffed with
qualified and trained personnel. At the same time, due to the presence of
expatriate staff and in an effort to retain its qualified personnel, the



- 10 -
salary bill of ABPNG is higher than most agricultural credit banks in other
developing countries. Only about 20Z of the national staff are diploma
holders or college graduates.   Under a recent ADB project (Loan 611), ABPNG
began a long-term manpower and career development program. The plan
includes: (a) an evaluation of existing manpower resources and identifying
needy areas; (b) organization of training programs; (c) localization, i.e.,
replacement of expatriate staff with local staff; and (d) programs to meet
future manpower requirements. Consistent with revised staff allocations
within the branches and the need to reduce personnel and administrative costs,
ABPNG has started a staff retrenchment program. Staff has been reduced from
425 in 1980 to the present level of 334, with reductions primarily in records
and loan clerks and excess administrative personnel. In order to attract
qualified staff and reduce staff turnover, ABPNG has initiated measures to
improve benefits and ensure remuneration competitive with the private
sector. The rate of staff turnover has in fact declined from a peak of 27Z in
1981 to 12Z in 1984. The localization program is proceeding at a satisfactory
pace without sacrificing the efficiency of the bank and its lending and
investment operations. From 54 expatriate officers in 1974, the number has
declined to 35 in 1980 and 21 in March 1985.
2.11      As part of its manpower plan, ABPNG is improving its in-house
training which deals with project appraisal, project promotion, arrears man-
agement and business finance. In addition, local colleges such as the
Banker's ColLege, Administrative College, and Institute of Management have
trained at Least 60 officers in the last 5 years. Short-term overseas train-
ing programs are also available, mostly on project appraisal, trainer training
and management, including courses at the Australia Administrative College and
programs sponsored by ADB, New Zealand, and the Asia and Pacific Regional
Agriculture Credit Association (APRACA). From 1980 to 1984, about 358 person-
nel participated in in-house training programs and 43 in overseas programs.
ABPNG's training capability was substantially improved during 1984 through
secondment of four experienced rural lenders from the New Zealand Rural
Bank. These are employed in a consultancy capacity, essentially to revise
existing agricultural loan appraisal and review procedures, introduce new
forms of documentation, and train national officers in both office and field
situations. Funding of secondees' salaries is by grant through New Zealand
aid with ABPNG meeting only cost of accommodation and internal travel. ABPNG
is, however, still faced with a shortage of qualified and trained staff. Only
1% of total income over recent years has been devoted to staff training, and
the high turnover of senior expatriate personnel has not been conducive to
training of national personnel. The proposed project would assist ABPNG's
training efforts, particularly agricultural lending, electronic data
processing and corporate planning.
2.12      Lending and Investment Policies.  The operational policies of ABPNG
are governed in practice by the May 1977 PoLicy Statement of its Board. The
Statement directs ABPNG to provide maximum benefits to PNG's indigenous people
and to ensure the balanced development of the economy. To minimize investment
risks and maintain a sound portfolio, ABPNG's policies include the following
exposure limits: (a) liabilities should not be more than three times its
paid-up capital plus surplus reserves; (b) total loans outstanding to a single
enterprise should not exceed 25% of bank equity; (c) equity investments in a



- 11 -
single enterprise should na  ezceed IO  of ABPNG's equity; (d) ABPNG's total
exposure in hire-purchase -  and equipment financing should not exceed its own
equity; and Ce) aggregate equity investments should not exceed 15X of its own
equity. The exposure limits followed by ABPNG are prudent.
2.13      Although ABPNC has concentrated on providing term loans and a
limited amount of equity investments, its policies and development efforts
have been innovative. ABPNG is responsible for initiating development of
successful medium-sized cocoa and coffee plantations through arrangements for
pooling of clan lands. Under the scheme, ABPNG has developed over 100 coffee
plantations with an average size of 20 ha in the Highland Provinces and about
35 cocoa plantations in similar schemes. ABPNG actively promotes the "nucleus
estate" concept, notably in oil palm andf poultry, where weLl-managed companies
assist smallholders with the provision of inputs, processing and marketing.
In the commercial sector, ABPNC launched the "Stret Pasin Stoa Scheme"
designed to introduce nationals to retail trade. Under the scheme, ABPNC
acquires retail outlets in urban areas from expatriate owners and transfers
manAgement to nationals who have received training in ABPNG's subsidiary,
Retail Management Services, Pty. Ltd.
2.14      Loan and Investment Procedures.  ABPNG's operational procedures at
head office and at the branches are patterned after those of comercial banks.
Its operational and lending manuals are well written and provide standards for
project appraisal, loan processing, branch management, and other operations.
Recently, significant improvements have been achieved on ABPNG's project
appraisal, loan processing and supervision standards. Two agricultural devel-
opment bankers engaged under the Second Agricultural Credit Project assisted
ABPNC in devising a set of detailed and comprehensive schedules for origi-
nating agricultural loans and a comprehensive field manual of procedures for
field reporting, project appraisal, inspection and loan processing. In addi-
tion, two tree crop specialists were recruited on a short-term basis under the
Second Agricultural Credit Project to prepare detailed guidelines and norms
for the systematic assessment of the agronomic feasibility of a coffee or
rubber development project. For large agricultural loans (over K 65,000) and
investment operations, the technical manuals are supplemented by appraisal
criteria requiring a detailed feasibility study on the technical, marketing,
financial and economic aspects of the project. While no new forms have been
designed for commercial and industrial loans, the present narrative form is
fairly comprehensive and more thorough appraisal reports are being produced.
2.15      Under current regulations, ABPNG's Operations Department is
responsible for all lending operations. All large loans (above K 100,000) and
others as required are referred to the Technical Department for investigation
and evaluation, but the Operations Department processes the majority of appli-
cations and has final responsibility for loan approval. The authority for
loan approval and disbursement is highly centralized in the head office in
view of the shortage of technical expertise for project appraisal. ABPNG has
1/ Loans for vehicles under which ABPNC retains title to the vehicle until
the loan is fully paid.



- 12 -
increased the level of discretionary authority of Regional Managers to approve
and control loans in order to facilitate the lending process. Regional
offices can now approve loans for amounts up to K 35,000 and disburse funds on
approved loans to an upper limit of K 150,000 in accordance with terms and
conditions of loan approval.
2.16      Following normal banking practice, ABPNG seeks to obtain adequate
collateral on its loans. A first mortgage or equitable mortgage is arranged
for all industrial and commercial projects, but security is difficult to
obtain in agricultural projects. Collateral is usually not available since
over 95% of the land in PNG is customary land owned by clans, with many
individuals having usage rights. ABPNG has devised a system of "Clan Land
Usage Agreements" which assure borrowers undisturbed usage of the land. ABPNG
requests clan members to act as guarantors who, should the need arise, would
take over the project if the original borrowers default.
2.17      Budgeting and Planning.  ABPNG's budgeting for loan and investment
operations is deficient and has led to severe cash flow constraints when loan
approvals and disbursements have not been planned in line with internally
generated funds, budget funds from Government or external loan sources.
Allocations have tended to be ad hoc or based on historical lending patterns
rather than sectoral priorities determined through economic analyses or a
portfolio plan. ABPNG, cognizant of the importance of economic factors in the
determination of annual lending programs, has recruited an economist and begun
the preparation of a corporate plan. The proposed project would reinforce
ABPNG's ongoing efforts to strengthen both the economic direction of its
portfolio and corporate financial management.
2.18      Loan Operations.  ABPNG loan operations from 1980 through 1984 are
summarized below and details are in Annex 2, Table 1:

Commercial loans were mostly for retail stores (Stret Pasin Stoas) and
wholesale trade, while loans for the service sector were for transport,



- 13 -
shipping, hotels, etc. Loans to industry were for building and construction,
ship and boat building, timber milling, mining and quarrying, etc. In line
with Government development policy, the agricultural sector is the major
recipient of ABPNG loans. Until 1982, loan approvals to agriculture increased
on average by 30Z annually from K 6.9 million in 1978 to K 14.9 million in
1981, largely due to the promotion of 20 ha cocoa and coffee schemes under the
Second Agricultural Credit Project and expanded lending for oil palm develop-
ment. Coffee and cocoa loan approvals comprised 85% of total agricultural
loans in 1983. During the same period, ABPNG reduced lending to service
industries in favor of more productive industrial loans in mining and manufac-
turing. In 1982, however, the overall lending level dropped by about 64Z.
This large reduction resulted in part from ABPNG's tight liquidity position
and poor repayment performance. The staff concentrated on the collection of
past due accounts rather than on the appraisal of new loans. The volume of
agricultural loans recovered in 1983 and 1984, more than doubling to K 11.3
million in 1983, and increasing again by 23% to K 13.8 million in 1984. ABPNG
is now promoting a smaller number of more productive loans with larger average
loan size. Average loan size for all lending increased from K 2,562 in 1980
to K 5,749 in 1984.
2.19      Loan Portfolio and Arrears.  In assessing the quality of ABPNG's
loan portfolio, the following must be considered: (a) ABPNG is a lender-of-
Last-resort devoted to the development of agriculture and industry even in
higher-risk situations; (b) an ABPNG loan is most likely the first exposure of
the borrower to a financial institution, and thus borrowers have no prior
operating history that ABPNG can use to appraise the borrower's creditworthi-
ness and the viability of his enterprise; (c) agricultural projects have long
gestation periods and are subject to adverse weather conditions, weak world
market prices, and other conditions beyond the control of ABPNG; and (d) com-
munications between ABPNG personnel and many borrowers is difficult because of
the remote location of the borrowers.
2.20      Details of ABPNG's loan portfolio (outstandings) are shown in
Annex 2, Table 2. The portfolio at December 31, 1984 comprises 8,658 loans
amounting to K 49.7 million (before provisions for bad debts). Agricultural
loans comprise K 31.5 million of the total portfolio or about 63% of out-
standings and are expected to rise to 80% of the total portfolio.
2.21      One of the problems confronting ABPNG in its efforts to improve its
financial performance is the level of arrears. Details of arrears are pro-
vided in Annex 2, Table 2, and are summarized below:

At December 1984, arrears are reported at K 4.5 million and represented 13% of
the loans on repayment. However, this figure underestimates ABPNG's arrears
and bad debt situation because of a "credit arrears" figure amounting to
K 2.2 million which represents prepayments, repayments on loans with incorrect
repayment schedules, and other technical problems involving erroneous loan
information in the computer. Discounting "credit arrears", the gross arrears
would amount to K 6.8 million, approximately 19.5Z of the loans on repayment
and 13.7Z of loans outstanding. About 62Z of the arrears are overdues exceed-
ing one year. Using the gross arrears figure and distributing total doubtful
debts among the loan categories, arrears at end 1984 are as follows:

Agricultural loan defaults account for 41Z of total arrears, commercial and
industrial loans, 29Z and equipment finance 23%. Lower arrears are evidenced
in hire-purchase loans since the vehicles are owned by ABPNC until full pay-
ment of the loan. Mini loans, a small loans program promoted by the
Government and granted with superficial appraisal, constitute only 3Z of the
arrears although the program is 100Z in arrears and has been discontinued.
ABPNG's arrears have been caused by inadequate or faulty appraisal of the
subloan application, insufficient monitoring and supervision of projects,
difficulty of collecting from large numbers of widely dispersed borrowers, and
lack of vigor in dealing with defaults. The recession and poor commodity
prices a few years ago have also resulted in poor performance of large numbers
of commercial and industrial projects and inadequate incomes for smallholders.
2.22      ABPNG is initiating the necessary measures to control its level of
arrears and improve collections. An arrears management program for the
branches begun in September 1981 has had encouraging results; it is now being
expanded to include head office accounts which represent about 65% of ABPNG's
portfolio. ABPNG has developed a systematic approach to arrears management
including improved planning for collections, routine arrears reporting,
priority collection trips by the head office and branch personnel and optimum
use of manpower and vehicles to reach remote areas. For the small rural
loans, a system of sending monthly arrears lists to the field offices is used;
each field office then submits a three-month plan to visit each account in
arrears followed by a monthly report on the actual visits and collections.
The larger arrears are dealt with on an individual basis - foreclosure on
collateral, petitioning for receivers, forced sale, management takeover,
rehabilitation, etc. At the same time, operations staff are concentrating on
identification of problem projects in the early stages of loan supervision and
disbursement. Better procedures for appraising subloans have recently been
established (para. 2.14) and the monitoring and supervision of ongoing opera-
tions have been stepped up. All these efforts have been productive, resulting
in a significant improvement in ABPNG's arrears situation in 1984. From the
1982 peak level of K 8.8 million, arrears have declined to K 6.8 million in
1984 while the ratio of arrears to loans at repayment decreased from 26.7% to
19.5Z over the same period. The collection ratio (cash collectionsltotal due
for collection) also rose from 58% to 78Z.
2.23      ABPNG is also taking steps to correct and improve their loans and
arrears statistics by reviewing all loan accounts, eliminating suspense
account listings (i.e., loans that have been implemented but not accounted for
in the computer), and developing a software program for accounting interest
and principal separately. The Rural Lending and Commercial and Industrial
Lending Divisions in the Operations Department in coordination with the Branch
Lending and Arrears Division are in the process of reviewing each account in
arrears with a view toward formulating an action program for dealing with the
past due account in terms of rescheduling, additional financing, securing the
collateral, or write-off. The provision for bad debts, K 6.0 million plus
K 1.7 million reserve for contingencies (about 15% of loans outstanding) is
presently adequate but should be reviewed periodically. ABPNG's debt write-
off policy is also being refined in order to delineate the timing, responsibi-
lity and authority for writing-off loans. Despite all these measures, there
is need for further improvements in ABPNG's arrears position which will be
undertaken under the proposed project.

2.24      Equity Investments.  Investments made under ABPNG's equity portfolio
total about K 1.8 million which is small in relation to lending operations
(Annex 2, Table 4). Equity investments have been limited to companies estab-
lished as promotional ventures or acquired from expatriates for transfer to
nationals. The subsidiaries in commerce and industry are engaged in printing,
car rental, food manufacturing, retail trade and janitorial services. Equity
investments in agriculture are mostly in livestock production - poultry, pig-
gery and cattle. ABPNG has lent a total of K 18.0 million to its subsidiaries
and associate companies, of which K 9.9 million are outstanding and K 0.4 mil-
lion (4Z of loans outstanding) are in arrears. ABPNC has not guaranteed any
loans of its subsidiaries and associate companies. The overall equity and
lending portfolio is sound. Dividends received in 1984 was equivalent to a
23.1% return on capital invested. In line with GOPNG policy of reducing
ABPNG's involvement in commercial and industrial sectors and to improve its
liquidity position, ABPNG has embarked on a five-year portfolio divestment
program to sell its holdings in these areas to new sponsors. The sale of non-
agriculture ABPNG shareholdings is expected to be completed by end 1989.
2.25      Income Statements.  ABPNG's comparative income statements ior 1980-
1984 are summarized below:

2.26      Operating results show a declining trend in net income from K 21,000
in 1980 to a loss of K 4.97 million in 1982 and K 627,000 in 1984.  Without
provisions for bad debts of about K 5.4 million (12%) of its loan portfolio in
1982, ABPNG would have shown a slight profit of K 0.4 million. Previous
provisions for bad and doubtful debts averaging about 1% in recent years have
been inadequate. ABPNG's interest spread increased to 8.9% in 1982 resulting
from previous increases in lending rates, the low cost of borrowed funds under
concessionary external loans, and cost-free equity provided by the Govern-
ment. Although interest and other income grew at an average annual rate of
12% during the last five years, it has not kept pace with increased
expenses. Total expenses (including cost of provisions for bad debt) as a
percentage of the loan portfolio rose from 13.4% in 1980 to 27% in 1982 and
16.5% in 1984. Administrative expenses are high in ABPNG because of the
expatriate staff, the number of branches needed to serve a large number of
borrowers scattered throughout the rural areas and the high cost of travel to
isolated communities. Due to a limited market, ABPNG's overhead costs are
spread over a small loan base. ABPNG's ratio of operating expenses to loan
portfolio is however comparable to other financial institutions in PNG. For
example, the operating expenses ratio of PNGBC is 17.4% but its ratio of
income to loans outstanding is 18%, thus providing a slim profit. Salaries
comprise the highest share of ABPNG's expenses (40%) while borrowing expenses
constitute 29%, and bad debts, 18%. About 25% of total salaries go to 6% of
the total staff, the expatriate officers. Substantial savings may be gained
by intensive training of local staff to replace the expatriate officers (an
estimated K 616,000 - K 770,000 p.a.), and a localization program is currently
underway to achieve this. ABPNG is making a major effort to reduce personnel
and operating costs with staff reduction (a decrease of 91 personnel from 1980
to 1984), branch reorganization, and localization (a decrease of 14 expatriate
officers over the 1980-L984 period). However, these programs will take time
and should be undertaken without impairing the efficient operations of the
bank.

While the debt/equity ratio has risen to 49:51 from much lower levels, this is
not a cause for alarm as the Government has routinely increased ABPNG's
capital since mid-1982 to assist ABPNG in financing long-term agricultural
loans. A revaluation of fixed assets in 1982 amounting to K 6.6 million
further increased capital. ANPNG's current-ratio of 3.1 is high because of
advances provided by the Government which allowed ABPNG to increase its
current assets. Owing to its large equity base, ABPNG has a satisfactory
financial position as measured against conventional indicators.
D. Issues in Agricultural Credit
Interest Rates
2.28      An important issue confronting agricultural credit in PNG is the
interest rate policy. Interest rates in the country are primarily determined
by market forces. A previous floor on the passbook savings rate has been
abolished and there are no ceilings on lending rates (para. 2.02). For ABPNG,
however, since November 1984, the Government has prescribed the interest rate



- 19 -
structure (shown below) which not only sets rates below those of the co _er-
cial bank rates but also incorporates subsidies to specific target groups.
ABPNG lends at the "official" rates prescribed by Government (see column 1)
but targetted beneficiaries are charged lower rates (column 2), with
Government paying ABPNG the difference.

/a   Applies only to the development period before tree crops begin bearing.
2.29      The objectives of the interest rate subsidy are to accelerate the
growth of the agricultural sector and tree crop production and exports;
increase the incomes of smallholders and those in disadvantaged districts; and
increase the productivity of smallholders by making available subsidized
finance for cash inputs and the adoption of a higher level of technology. In
order to implement this subsidy scheme the Government has already committed
over the next four years: (a) K 40 million of loan funds to ABPNG at 3Z p.a.
for relending; (b) K 10 million to cover the subsidies on interest rates; and
(c) K 5 million to cover operating losses of ABPNG as the real costs of lend-
ing by ABPNG exceed their income even at the official lending rates.
2.30      The Bank recognizes the importance of GOPNG's objective to accel-
erate agricultural production by providing a measure of credit subsidy to the
smallholder sector through ABPNG. However, among the Bank's concerns are that
the interest rate subsidies would defeat the long-term viability of ABPNC,
lead to misallocation of resources, and aggravate the inequitable distribution



- 20 -
of income as less profitable enterprises aria bigger farmers would tend to
receive the cheap loans. Thus, the Bank suspended the processing of this
proposed project in November 1983 and reappraised the project in February/
March 1985 only after intensive policy dialogue with GOPNG on interest rates
and significant improvements in ABPNG's performance. An agreement was reachea
with the Government during negotiations that:
(a) the subsidy payments to ABPNG would not exceed K 12 million during
the period January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1988;
(b) the level of subsidies and interest rates would; be reviewed annually
with the Bank, commencing not later than December 31, 1986 with a
view to:
(i) monitoring the level of subsidies and their impact on subloan
demand;
(ii) assessing the effectiveness of the subsidies;
(iii) identifying other incentives for stimulating smallholder
production; and
(iv) making recommendations for reduction of interest rate during
the implementation period of the project.
.c) the interest rate subsidies would be directed to individual farmers
or groups of farmers living at or below the poverty level (estimated
by the Bank to be about K 275 per capita p.a.).
Under these conditions, credit subsidies would be sharply focused on specific
target groups, explicitly provided for in the public budget so that there
could be an accounting, and subject to ongoing efforts to assess whether
alternative, more efficient instruments could be used in their place. More-
over, ABPNG's onlending rates are positive compared with the average inflation
rate over the 1981-84 period (7.5%) and projected inflation in 1986 (7.5%),
1987-90 (8Z) and 1991 onwards (5%). They are also significantly higher than
the savings deposit rate of 3-6%. The annual cost of subsidies to ABPNG is
estimated to be about K 144,000-K 1.1 million for the lower cost of funds and
K 1.2-K 1.9 million to cover the bank's operating losses. The interest rate
subsidies to the target beneficiaries would cost about K 16,000-K 194,000 p.a.
since the subloans at subsidized rates would constitute only 10% to 151 of the
projected total loan disbursements of ABPNG over the next five years. The
total subsidies would be Less than 0.5% of the projected national budget.
Institutional Weaknesses
2.31      Since appraisal in 1983, ABPNG has achieved substantial progress
in: (a) streamLining its branch network; (b) reducing both local and expatri-
ate staff; (c) improving lending procedures and supervision; (d) initiating a
corporate plan; and (e) improving the arrears position. Despite these
achievements, ABPNG still faces organizational problems which constrain its
lending capability. These include the absence of a Deputy Managing Director



- 21 -
to assist management, shortage of qualified and trained staff, inadequate
planning and budgeting, high administrative costs, inadequate management
information system, and poor financial performance. Administrative expenses
are high in ABPNG compared to development finance institutions in other devel-
oping countries because ABPNG employs expatriate staff, has a small loan base,
and caters to a clientele of widely diverse cultural backgrounds located in
isolated communities. The arrears position of ABPNG also needs to be improved
further through an intensified collection campaign. This project has been
prepared to alleviate these problems. The project would strengthen the insti-
tutional development of ABPNG through technical assistance, staff training,
provision of adequate vehicles and data processing equipment, and an Action
Program and Financial Strategy. The action program is designed to reduce
ABPNC's costs, strengthen financial management and arrears control, improve
ABPNG's planning, budgeting and accounting, strengthen organization and man-
agement and improve the bank's manAgement information system and data
collection (Annex 3 and paras. 4.03-4.04).
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.32      By its support to the proposed project, the Bank would encourage
greater inflow of investment into PNG's agriculture sector and assist in
accelerating the development of less developed provinces in the country. The
Bank would aLso encourage greater smallholder participation, institution
building, sectoral development and training of sectoral staff. Through the
project, the Bank would assist in developing the financial sector and in fos-
tering the growth of the rural credit markets. The Bank would support the
institution building efforts of GOPNG started under the Second Agricultural
Credit Project by strengthening the lending capability and implementation
capacity of ABPNG. Through its involvement in the project, the Bank wouLd
contribute to interest rate policy reform by assuring a periodic review of
interest rate subsidies with a view to gradually reducing these subsidies over
the project implementation period.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would continue Bank support to the Government's
program of rehabilitating and deveLoping the tree crop sector through loans to
ABPNC, which was started under the Second Agricultural Credit Project
(Cr. 1149). The project would strengthen ABPNC as a deveiopment financing
institution to enable it to perform its role effectively as the main conduit
for agricultural credit in the country. The project also addresses GOPNG's
development objectives of: (a) increasing and broadening agriculturaL exports
through investments in crops for which PNG has a competitive advantage;
(b) reducing food imports through modest investments in piggery and poultry
enterprises; (c) providing a better livelihood for rural families.



- 22 -
B. Project Description
3.02      The Project would, over a three-year period:  (a) provide funds to
ARPNC for lending in tree crop development, poultry, piggery, new crops and
other agricultural subprojects, agro-processing facilities, and agricultural
equipment and transport vehicles; and (b) strengthen ABPNG by providing data
processing facilities, vehicles, funds for staff training, fellowships,
studies and administrative expenses and technical assistance for the engage-
ment of consultants who would assist in improving its management and financial
performance. The project would finance a three-year stice (1985-88) of
ABPNG's planned agricultural lending, i.e., subloans approved and disbursed
from March 1, 1985 to September 30, 1988. Since subprojects for tree crop
establishment will require financing beyond the project period, an agreement
was reached with Government during negotiations that all investments begun
under the project will be completed using Government and/or ABPNG funds for
the period not covered by project financing.
Subprojects
3.03      A summary of subproject investment costs under the project is in
Table 3.1. These are indicative targets based on potential subloan demand,
investor interest and management capability. About US$4.9 million (21Z) is
expected to be invested in cocoa production and US$2.6 million (1lX) for the
replanting of oil palm for export. Piggery and poultry enterprises would
receive about llZ of the subproject funds while US$3.3 million is allocated
for new crops, other agricultural production activities and agro-processing.
About US$4.4 million (191) is expected to go to the purchase of agricultural
transport vehicles and US$5.8 million (24X) to agricultural equipment.

3.04      Approvals and Disbursements.  ABPNG approvals and disbursements
under the project and portfolio operations are detailed in Annex 2, Tables 5-8
and are sumnarized below.

/a   Net of bad debts.
3.05      New loan approvals under the project are expected to increase from
K 4.4 million in 1985 to about K 7.0 million by 1988 (Annex 2, Tables 5 and
6). Disbursements under the project would increase from about K 3.1 million
in 1985 to K 6.8 million in 1988, comprising about 22-45% of the projected
total loan disbursements of ABPNG over the four-year period (Annex 2, Table
7). Detailed assumptions of all financial projections are available in staff
working papers.
3.06      Cocoa Development.  Project funds would support subloans for
developing cocoa areas totalling about 4,580 ha. Three types of cocoa devel-
opment would be financed: (a) replanting of 100 ha blocks of existing estates
owned by nationals belonging to clan or business groups; (b) new development
of 20 ha blocks owned by nationals belonging to business groups; (c) replant-
ing of 6.0 ha blocks belonging to smallholders in the Warangoi settlement in
East New Britain. The first scheme would cover 1,600 ha of existing estates
in East New Britain (601), New Ireland and North Solomon (20%), and Madang
(20%). Replanting would be done within one year after land clearing, followed
by the construction of a fermentary/drier in the fourth year. The 20 ha cocoa
development would cover 2,080 ha situated in East New Britain (10), North
Solomon (40Z), Madang (30%), Sepik (1O%), and West New Britain and North
Ireland (10%). Under the Warengoi resettlement scheme, 150 settler families
would replant about 900 ha using budded and/or hybrid cocoa as planting
material. Cocoa subloans would help reverse the production declines
experienced in the cocoa industry since 1974-75.



- 24 -
3.07      Oil Palm Development.  At the Hoskins resettlement scheme in West
New Britain, about 1,200 settler families would each replant a 4.0 ha block of
oil palm. Smallholder oil palm was originally planted on this area in 1968-73
under Credit 137-PNG with the assistance of the New Britain Palm Oil
Development Ltd. (NBPOD), a company jointly owned by the Government and
Harrisons and Crossfield. Trees planted in 1968-69 now require replanting
because of declining yields and, at heights of more than 15 meters, harvesting
has become extremely difficult.
3.08      Livestock Development.  In the livestock sector, project funds would
finance small poultry producers who are contract growers of large broiler
processing firms such as Ilimo Farm Products in Port Moresby and New Guinea
Table Birds in Lae. The subloan would cover the construction of broiler sheds
and the purchase and installation of the necessary equipment. The processing
firm would advance day-old chicks and feed on credit basis; provide supervi-
sion, technical advice and veterinary services free of charge; and buy back
the 8-week old broilers on a liveweight basis. Only about 10 commercial size
piggeries linked to central processors in Lae and Port Moresby are expected to
be financed under the project. This is proposed since small family-size
operations financed under previous projects have not been successful.
3.09      New Crops and Other Agricultural Projects.  The project would
encourage lending for non-traditional agricultural projects (e.g., cardamom,
pyrethrum, vegetable, corn, citrus, etc.) to assist in the diversification of
the production pattern in the country. It would also finance rehabilitation
and replacement planting of a limited area (not exceeding 1,000 ha) of coffee.
This would help sustain the current average level of coffee production in
P1NG. During negotiations an agreement was reached that, two months prior to
the start of ABPNG's fiscal year, ABPNG would submit to the Bank for review
and approval an annual program for lending to new crops or other agricultural
projects including the technical, economic and financial justification for
such lending.
3.10      Agro-Processing.  The subloans for agro-processing facilities would
be for small and large-scale cocoa dryers/fermentaries and coffee processing
facilities. Small facilities (200-300 kg) would be for weLl established
smallholders on 6 ha blocks who have previously demonstrated their ability to
repay their loans to ABPNG. The borrowers would process their own crop but
would have the opportunity to process outside crops on a contract basis.  The
large plants would be sited on large developing plantations (about 100 ha)
which have not borrowed from ABPNG for field development but have the
necessary amount of raw materials to process and the capacity to repay the
loan.
3.11      Agricultural Transport and Equipment.  Vehicles to transport
agricultural produce (trucks, boats, outboard motors, small planes, etc.)
would be financed on a hire-purchase basis, i.e., ABPNG would retain title to
the vehicle until full payment of the loan at which time the borrower assumes
ownership of the asset. The agricultural equipment to be financed would
include earthmoving equipment, portable sawmills, and other agricultural
machinery. Subloans for agricultural transport vehicles and equipment are
considered essential in the provision of better transport, processing and



- 25 -
marketing facilities to support che incremental production capacity that would
be generated from the project. These subloans are also quick disbursing, more
profitable and fully secured; hence, they will improve ABPNG's liquidity and
profitability. Smallholders and estates have virtually no alternative sources
of financing their agricultural transport and equipment purchases other than
through ABPNG since other financial institutions lack branches outside Port
Moresby and deal mostly with large commercial enterprises and foreign owned
plantations.
ABPNG Strengthening
3.12      Vehicles and Data Processing Equipment.  The project would provide
vehicles to support the intensified supervision and arrears collection camr-
paign of ABPNG. This would increase the number of field visits by project
officers and the frequency of contacts with delinquent borrowers. To improve
the management information system of the bank, data processing equipment and
software would be financed under the project. Under the current Electronic
Data Processing (EDP) plan, computer terminals and printers would be installed
in the regional offices and key departments of the head office. The present
UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) which is obsolete and insufficient will be
replaced and security devices for the computer would be installed to prevent
accidental destruction or loss in any of the systems. Computer software would
also be upgraded to replace the current accounting system which is inadequate
and based on a non-standard language.
3.13      Technical Assistance.  The project would finance about 108 man-
months of consultant services in the following disciplines to enable ABPNG to
strengthen its overall lending capability:
(a) senior development banker (3 years) for the position of Deputy
Managing Director to strengthen ABPNG management, assist the
Managing Director with short and long term plans for reorganization,
financial management and control, the manpower development program
and coordination of the various departments, regional offices and
branches of ABPNG;
(b) training specialist (2 years) to define manpower skill gaps,
identify training needs, evaluate and improve in-house training
programs, upgrade the staff training capability of existing ABPNG
staff, and assist in the implementation of the fellowship program;
(c) systems analyst/electronic data processing specialist (2.5 years) to
develop and test computer software and train ABPNG staff in their
use in accounting, subloan monitoring, collection and arrears
reporting and other operational requirements; and
(d) tree crop agronomists (1.5 years) for short-term periods to prepare
and/or update technical guidelines and lending manuaLs on agricul-
tural projects, prepare farm models on new agricultural projects,
advise on agronomic aspects of loan approval and supervision of the
plantation management agencies engaged by the borrowers to implement
field development and train ABPNG staff on these aspects.



- 26 -
The systems analyst and short-term consultants on tree crops were engaged by
ABPNG under the Second Agricultural Credit Project. The extension of the
services of the systems analyst and the availability of short-term
consultancies on tree crop agronomy would be supported under this project.
3.14      Staff Training and Fellowships.  Staff training expenses, eight
fellowships overseas for degree courses in accounting, banking and finance and
various short-term development banking courses abroad, would be financed by
the project. The training program will emphasize management training for
local staff who would fill the expatriate positions that are expected to be
vacant in the next five years. The training specialist to be recruited would
evaluate manpower skill gaps, assess the effectiveness of existing training
programs, ensure that training is given in all departments by existing senior
personnel and develop an improved program and curriculum for in-house
training. The consultant will also assist ABPNG in screening participants to
the overseas degree courses, identifying suitable colleges and programs which
would meet the needs of ABPNG personnel and administering the fellowship
program.
3.15      Over the next three years, ABPNG would train 279 staff from all
leveLs on various aspects of bank operations (Annex 1, Table 2). Courses
would cover loan administration (e.g., records procedures, securities and
business communication), lending guideLines and principles, accounting and
budgeting, project appraisal and supervision, training and management
skills. Field training of the growing force of rural project officers and
supervision by the regional offices and branches would be emphasized as well
as on-the-job training for Head Office staff. Other course work is to be held
in the Secretarial College, Administrative College, Bankers College, and
selected universities in PNG. The overseas courses would mostly be short term
sponsored by APRACA, ADB, New Zealand, Australia and other donors except for
the eight fellowships to be financed under this project. The project would
finance the salaries of the training division, materials and curriculum
development, travel expenses, allowances, accommodation and meals of partici-
pants, course fees and tuition, books and other operational expenses related
to training. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the training
component of the project would be carried out under a plan agreed with the
Bank.
3.16      Studies.  Under the Second Agricultural Credit Project, the major
concerns have been the implementation capability and financial condition of
ABPNG. Subloan approval and disbursement, performance of management agencies
and the status of field development were monitored regularly. However, a
large information gap exists on the impact of the project on beneficiaries.
The proposed project would finance case studies which would monitor and
evaluate the impact of the subloans on farmers' income, expenditure pattern,
financial condition, attitudes and social well-being. The Monitoring and
Evaluation (MWE) of "grass roots" socioeconomic and cultural factors and of
beneficiary attitudes would be essential to assure the desired quality, impact
and eventual repayment of subloans.

C. Project Cost
3.17      Project coots over the three-year project implementation period
would amount to US$31.3 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of
US$200,000 equivalent and foreign exchange of US$17.0 million equivalent,
(552). The project costs include incremental operational expenses of ABPUG
required to implement the project such as personnel salaries, office and
equipment rental, travel expenditures, utilities, etc. Costs are calculated
in March 1985 prices updated to July 1985. Since this project is essentially
a line of credit to help finance a program defined in financial terms, contin-
gency allowances have been integrated into the cost of individual subprojects
and non-credit components. It is expected that any cost changes would lead to
an adjustment in. the number of subloans. Project costs by component are
su ma rized in Table 3.3 and presented in detail in Annex 1, Table 1.

,b7  Includes taxes and duties of about US$0.2 million equivalent.
D. Financing
3.18      Of the total project cost net of taxes and duties, the Bank would
contribute US$18.8 million or 60Z; the Government, USS5.5 million or 18X;
ABPMG, US$4.2 million or 13Z; and the subborrovers, US$2.8 million or 9X
(Table 3.4). The Bank loan would cover the full foreign exchange requirement
and US$1.8 million of the local cost. Local cost financing is justified in
view of the local content of the anticipated subloans for smallholder agricul-
tural development and the high priority Government attaches to this type of
development. The loan would be at standard variable interest rate for 16
years with a 7 year grace period. Government would be the Borrower and would
assume the foreign exchange and interest risks. Retroactive financing for up
to US$1.8 million would be made available to cover eligible expenditures



- 28 -
beginning March 1, 1985. Retroactive -finane-ing is required because ABPNC has
already enlarged its lending program in expectation of this project. If ABPNC
had not sustained the lending momentum achieved under the Second Agricultural
Credit Project, farmers' Loar demand would have diminished as a result of
uncertainty, loan disbursements would be unreasonabLy delayed and the planting
program would suffer a setback. In addition, retroactive financing would
assure the continuity of service of the consultants engaged under the Second
Agricultural Credit Project.

3.19     Relending Terms.  The Government would enter into a subsidiary loan
agreement (SLA) with ABPNC under which US$18.8 million of project funds would
be available to ABPNG at 3Z interest repayable in 16 years, including 7 years
of grace. The terms are in line with expected subloan repayments. The SLA
would be agreed with the Bank, and its signing would be a condition of effec-
tiveness.   As part of the Government's credit subsidy scheme (para. 2.29),
ABPNC would receive supplementary funds from the Government amounting to
US$2.1 million as a loan under the same terms as the SLA and US$3.4 million in
the form of equity. The subsidy to ABPIC is required to minimize the negative
effects of the Government's interest rate policy on the financial condition of
the bank. GOPNG has prescribed low interest ceilings on agricultural loans
and mandated the increase in the share of agricultural loans in ABPNG's total
loan portfolio. This lowers the average yield and increases the risk of ABPNC
lending. ABPNC will also continue to operate under difficult conditions due
to the high cost of lending to small and widely scattered projects with a
clientele that is net- to the concept of credit, commercial enterprise and
entrepreneurship. The subsidies, however, would be reviewed annually with the
Bank with a view to gradually phasing them out and raising interest rates to
more adequately cover costs.



- 29 -
3.20      ABPNG would onlend the loan proceeds tolits subborrowers at the
following rates: cocoa, pouLtry/piggery, agro-processing, new crops, other
agriculture (9.5M); oil palm (10.5Z); agricultural transport (20Z); and agri-
cultural equipment (181). Repayment terms would be based on the technical/
financial profile of the field investments to be made. The repayment periods
(in years and grace period in parentheses) are expected to be as follows:
tree crops other than oil paLm, 12 (5); oil palm, 9 (5); piggery and poultry,
10 (0); new crops and other agricultural production activities, depending on
the cash flow but not more than 12 (5); agro-processing, 3 (0); agricultural
transport vehicles and equipment, 3 (0). Subborrowers will provide an equity
contribution, equal to about 51 of their farm investments, in the form of
cash, labor and materials and 20Z of the cost of agricultural vehicles and
equipment and oil palm replanting. The actual borrowing costs of disadvan-
taged districts, smallholders, and tree crop projects during the development
phase (except oil palm) would be at lower rates of 5Z, 7% and 8Z, respectively
and the Government will pay ABPNG the difference between its onlending rates
and the subsidized rates.
E. Procurement
3.21      The range of goods to be financed under the project for on-farm
inv.stments is varied and would not be suitable for bulk procurement. As
under the Second Agricultural Credit Project, borrowers would purchase plant-
ing materials, fertilizer and chemicals, building material, machinery, tools
and equipment in accordance with their own choice, through normal commercial
channels by shopping with at least three suppliers. Competition for the
various inputs expected to be procured by individual borrowers would be keen
and prices competitive with world market prices. Land clearing and prepara-
tion, planting and upkeep (amounting to about US$3.1 million) would be carried
out by the beneficiaries themselves, by members of their clan, or in cases of
shortage by bired labor. Planting materials (US$1.6 million) would be
acquired through local shopping arrangements from local sources which have
adequate supplies. For cocoa projects situated around the city of Rabaul,
planting material would be provided by ABPNG's nursery. The nucleus estate
would provide oil palm planting materials to the settlers from its nurseries.
Building materials, small machinery, equipment and accessories (US$1.4 mil-
lion) and fertilizer and chemicals (US$0.8 million), which would be delivered
to widely dispersed areas, would continue to be imported and distributed by
private dealers. International competitive biddin't (ICB) would not be
feasible for the procurement by subborrowers of agricultural transport (US$4.2
million) and agricultural equipment (US$5.4 million) because the size of
individual investments would be too small and bulking of contracts is not
practicable due to cheir expected diversity and wide dispersal both in loca-
tion and time. Field management (US$1.8 million) would be contracted by
participating farmers to experienced local firms on the basis of a preselec-
tion made by ABPNG. These arrangements have proved satisfactory in the
past. Forty-six (46) four-wheel drive vehicles (US$0.4 million) and data
processing equipment (US$O.1 million) for ABPNG operations would be procured
by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. The contract for the systems
analyst engaged under the Second Agricultural Credit Project would be extended
by 2.5 years under the same terms of reference. The post for Deputy Managing



- 30 -
Director has been advertised and a suitably qualified individual is expected
to be recruited by December 31, 1985. The terms of reference of the tree crop
agronomists were prepared under the Second Agricultural Credit Project and
would not be changed under this project. The terms of reference for the
training specialist and the monitoring and evaluation studies would be pre-
pared by ABPNG in consultation with the Bank by December 31, 1985. Consul-
tancy services would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants.
F. Disbursement
3.22      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made on the basis
of: (a) 69Z of subloans disbursed by ABPNG; (b) 100X of the cost of consult-
ant's services, ABPNG staff training expenses and fellowships, and studies;
and (c) 100% of foreign expenditures and 65% of local expenditures for
vehicles and-equipment. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that
ABPNG would submit all subloans exceeding K 120,000 to the Bank for prior
approval along with appraisal reports on the technical, marketing, financial
and economic feasibility of the subproject. The introduction of a special
account was discussed during negotiations but was not considered feasible by
the Goveranent delegation. Disbursements will be fully documented except
those against subloans and staff training expenses which would be based on
certified statements of expenditure (SOE). Supporting documentation would be
made available for review by supervision missions. Loan closing is expected
by June 30, 1989. An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 1,
Table 3 and a proposed allocation of loan proceeds in Annex 1, Table 4. The
projected disbursement schedule deviates from the historical profile of dis-
bursements for agricultural projects in Indonesia, PNG and the Pacific Islands
because of the presence of retroactive financing in the first semester and the
nature of the project. Since this is an agricultural project which would
finance a specific time slice (1985-88) of ABPNG's Lending operations, dis-
bursements would be terminated at the completion of the three-year period.
Moreover, the projected disbursement schedule is consistent with the disburse-
ment profile of the Second Agricultural Credit Project. ABPNG has also
accumulated sufficient experience in handling subloans financed under previous
Bank projects which would tend to accelerate disbursement.
C. Accounting and Auditing
3.23      ABPNG's accounting is computerized but present software neither
adequately covers requirements of lending operations, nor provides readily
retrievable accounts and management information. The accounting system and
computer utilization in ABPNG operations is being improved with assistance
under the Second Agricultural Credit Project. "Profit center" accounting
would be introduced to provide revenue, cost, and lending data by operations
center (branches or head office), and data would become available on loans and
subborrowers by loan category, loan size, crop, area of development, etc.
Computer program improvements would be carried out under the proposed project
to provide appropriate collection and arrears reports. Revised accounting
centers would be integrated with an improved budget system to facilitate
financial planning.



- 31 -
3.24      An agreement was reached at negotiations that project accounts
including those disbursed against SOE would be maintained separately for
individual project components in accordance with sound accounting practices.
These would be made available for Bank examination d9 requested. ABPNG's
accounts are audited by the Auditor-General of PNC and more recently by
independent auditors. Audit reports in the past have not provided full
financial assessments of ABPNG operations or accounting procedures. An
agreement was reached at negotiations that an annual audit of ABPNG would be
carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank on behalf of the
Auditor General according to the Illustrative Form of Audit Report for
Development Finance Companies. Audit reports would be submitted to the Bank
within six months of the close of each fiscal year. These audit reports would
contain opinions on the findings and procedures used in preparing financial
statements, the quality of the portfolio, and the aaequacy of provisions for
bad and doubtful debts.
H. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
3.25      Project monitoring and reporting requirements will be the same as
those followed under the Second Agricultural Credit Project. ABPNG would
submit to the Bank quarterly and annual progress reports on its subloan dis-
bursements, action program, financial condition, arrears and collection,
withdrawal of Bank funding, training program, and terms of reference, execut-
ing agencies and costs of special studies and consultancies. In addition,
each regional office would maintain up-to-date files and statistics of its
project subloans which would be available for review by the Bank. ABPNG would
also prepare a Project Completion Report to be submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the closing date of the loan.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. ABPNG as Implementing Agenc
4.01      ABPNG would be the implementing agency of the proposed project.  It
would channel funds to and supervise the subprojects through its Operations
and Technical Departments and its regional offices and branches. Management
services to clan blocks, plantations or individual borrowers would be provided
by the National Plantation Management Agency (NPMA), private management agen-
cies, ABPNG staff, and central processors (for poultry and piggery). DPI
staff would provide assistance on technical aspects of the subprojects and
land utilization studies prior to ABPNG lending in new agricultural areas.
The Administration and Personnel and Accounting and Finance Departments would
handle studies, technical assistance, staff training, fellowships, vehicles,
data processing equipment, and administrative expenses.
Status of Preparation
4.02      ABPNG has capable managers and key staff in place who have carried
out similar programs. The post of Deputy Managing Director has been adver-
tised and the recruitment of a suitably qualified individual. a condition of
loan effectiveness, is expected by December 31, 1985. The systems analyst is



- 32 -
in place and the terms of reference for the tree crop agronomists have been
prepared. The terms of reference for the training specialist and the monitor-
ing and evaluation studies will be prepared by ABPNG, in consultation with the
Bank, by December 31, 1985. A plan has been agreed with the Bank on carrying
out the training component of the project. A five-year vehicle procurement
plan has been prepared by ABPNG and bidding documents are under preparation
for the first year requirements of vehicles and equipment to be purchased
under ICB. The approval of eligible subloans commenced March 1, 1985.
B. Action Program and Financial Strategy
4.03      In order to strengthen the capacity of ABPNG to implement this
project and improve its profitability, an agreement was reached at negotia-
tions that ABPNG would carry out the Action Program and Financial Strategy
outlined in Annex 3 according to the timetable indicated therein. The finan-
cial aspects of this plan include: (a) a staff retrenchment program from the
present 334 to 317 in 1989 to reduce costs; (b) a continuing localization
program to reduce the cost of expatriate staff; (c) a portfolio divestment
program; and (d) improved arrears management and collections. ABPNG would
also complete annual and five-year corporate plans for submission to the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank by March 31, 1986 and prepare annual budgets
of approvals and expected disbursements which would be consistent with avail-
able government budget funds, external loans and internally generated funds.
The corporate plan would provide direction to ABPNG's lending and investment
activities and a framework for developing its annual lending programs and
expenditure budgets. The Action Program also includes: (a) the establishment
of profit center accounting by March 31, 1986 to facilitate financial plan-
ning; (b) completion of an internal audit program for inspection of the head
office and branches by January 31, 1986; and (c) improvements in computer
programming and management information systems to provide ABPNG managers with
the information required for sound decision-making.
4.04      The Action Program for ABPNG is just one of several measures to
resolve ABPNG's financial difficulties. ABPNG is continually improving loan
appraisal, supervision and monitoring of subborrowers with the assistance of
development banking specialists provided under a New Zealand grant to train
branch field staff. This would enable ABPNG to make better loans and improve
the quality of its subprojects. Moreover, the interest rate structure would
be reviewed annually by GOPNG with the Bank with a view to gradually reduce
subsidies and increase ABPNG's interest rates on agricultural loans. GOPNG
has also allocated funds to cover the operating losses of ABPNG. Following
these actions, ABPNG should be in better financial health in 1990.
C. Lending Procedures
4.05      As in the Second Agriculture Credit Project, farmers or clan leaders
interested in 20 ha cocoa development would be contacted by staff of either
ABPNG, management agencies or provincial extension services and informed about
the project. Farmers who show definite interest would be helped by the above
staff in organizing themselves legally as business groups. These in turn



- 33 -
would obtain title to their previously surveyed and demarcated lands which
must be in minimum blocks of 15 to 20 ha. This process is expected to take
about three months and will be handled by staff of the Decentralization and
Land Departments and provincial staff, assisted when necessary by management
agents, private solicitors and surveyors.
4.06      The relevant ABPNG field office, after being approached for a loan
by one or more business groups, would establish that there were at least six
such groups in reasonable proximity to each other before asking them to choose
a manager from a ABPNC-approved list. The manager would subsequently prepare
a farm plan, assess the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers, and sub-
sequently would be in charge of developing the blocks, including land clearing
and preparation, maintenance, input supplies and marketing of produce. The
group members would be required to contribute as equity the clearing of the
land, drainage, roads, lining, shade establishment, and establishment of a
hybrid cocoa nursery. This equity input would make the project area ready for
the field planting of cocoa. During this period, the approved management
agency will be paid a premanagement fee (up to K 2,400/subproject) for a
period of up to one year to supervise the group's equity work, and the bank
will make funds available, when required, for the cost of the nursery, the
shade materials, tools, etc. The Government would subsidize the premanagement
fees while the remaining management fees would become part of the subloan
extended by ABPNG. The phasing out of management services would be over a 4-7
year period depending on each group's ability to assume management
responsibilities as determined by ABPNG's branch managers.
4.07      For cocoa estates, oil palm and cocoa settlement areas which have
families and land rights already established and settlement authorities in
place, procedures would be limited to ABPNG loan approval and supervision.
Commercial poultry and piggery investors will be relatively few in number and
will be in a much better position than participating farmers to arrange for
land leases and adequate management, and hence no complications are
expected. The borrowers for development of new crops or other agricultural
enterprises will most likely be national husine3s groups or .:ompanies and
would thus be handled in a similar manner as the 20-ha cocoa groups. Eligible
borrowers for agricultural transport vehicles and equipment would be only
farmers, national business groups, and companies engaged in agricultural
enterprises. The standard ABPNG procedures for loan processing, approval, and
supervision would apply. These lending procedures have been improved and are
considered satisfactory (para. 2.14).
D. Supervision of Subloans
4.08      Agricultural projects financed by ABPNG are currently being super-
vised by DPI for rubber and oil palm, plantation management agencies for
coffee and cocoa, and ABPNG staff for the Warengoi cocoa rehabilitation
scheme. The ABPNG supervision of the Warengoi scheme has produced the best
results in terms of the involvement of smallholders, quality of plantings, and
cost of tree crop establishment. The projects being supervised by DPI are
performing satisfactorily, but the shortage of qualified and trained staff
might constrain implementation of future subloans. The performance of manage-



- 34 -
ment agencies under the previous project was highly variable, ranging from
poor to adequate. They were deficient in involving the clan groups in planta-
tion activities, completing the planting within a reasonable period of time,
maintaining the plantings in good condition and in advising the clan group of
their current indebtedness. The agencies had full control of the loan pro-
ceeds but were not accountable for the success or failure of the project.
They received their management fee per hectare for the total area being
financed regardless of the area planted and of the quality of plantings.
There was also no mechanism to evaluate the performance of these agencies and
to compensate them accordingly. However, where ABPNG provided technical staff
to supervise the management agencies, as in cocoa projects in East New
Britain, the results were satisfactory. ABPNC has therefore instituted
measures to correct the deficiencies o' the system and strengthen supervision
in the field. Technical manuals were prepared by consultants under the Second
Agricultural Credit Project setting appropriate guidelines on project imple-
mentation. A system of periodic reviews in the field has been established to
assess the performance of management agencies. New field appraisal and review
procedures have been drawn up, including standardized and improved monthly and
quarterly returns, and forecast budgets submitted by management agencies. A
tripartite agreement involving ABPNG, the management agency and the owners has
been formulated which bases the management agency fee on the area planted,
gives ABPNG full control over the disbursement of funds, and delineates more
clearly the responsibilities of the management agency. With these measures,
the quality of field development shoald improve, thus enhano'ing the capability
of borrowers to repay the loan.
4.09      Pricing of Smallholder Oil Palm.  With respect to the financing of
oil palm replanting by smallholders in Hoskins, the appraisal mission found
that in 1982 smallholders were inadequately paid for their produce by the New
Britain Palm Oil Development (NBPOD), the company which operates the nucleus
estate. Consequently, the smallholders had little incentive to harvest their
crops, and had been reluctant to participate in the replanting scheme.
Although prices have now been increased, Government still seeks to ensure
maximum benefits for the oil palm smallholders to be financed under the proj-
ect. An agreement was reached at negotiations that Government would examine
on a quarterly basis the monthly statements of cost coefficients used by
nucleus estate companies in calculating FFB prices for smallholders and cause
such coefficients to be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the prices
provide a sufficient incentive for the smallholders to replant and harvest oil
palm. Detailed guidelines for accounting for prices to be paid to smallhold-
ers for their production are summarized in Annex 7.
E. Financial Projections
4.10      Projected Balance Sheet, Income and Cash Flow Statements of ABPNG
under the project are provided in Annex 2, Tables 9-li. The Profit and Loss
Statement shows increasing losses up to 1987 and lower losses in 1988-89.
This is a result of inadequate interest rates, increased operating and borrow-
ing expenses, and provisions for bad debts and contingencies that are large
relative to total income. The increasing share of lower yielding agricultural
loans to total loan portfolic as mandated by Government also contributes to



- 35 -
accumulating losses. A cost analysis of the portfolio is provided in Annex 2,
Table 12. The ratio of income to average loan portfolio would range from
12.7Z to 14.1% but total expenses as a proportion to loans would amount to
15.6-18x. The upward trend of operating expenses in the first three years of
the project is a result of the additional expenses of consultants, intensified
staff training, increased number of vehicles for supervision and collection,
and added travel, repaix and maintenance costs which are necessary for the
institution-building efforts of ABPNG. Borrowing expenses would be maintained
at 2.4% to 3.3% of the loan portfolio, and bad debts and contingencies provi-
sion, at 2.5-2.9Z.
4.11      Cash flow estimates indicate that ABPNG will continue to be
financially constrained due to: (a) loan disbursements exceeding repayments;
(b) increased operating expenditures; and (c) increased borrowing expenses.
In view of this constraint, GOPNG will have to make injections of equity
capitaL amounting to K 3.2 million and provide loans of about K 2.0 million to
ABPNG in addition to the loan proceeds from the Bank.
4.12      Projected balance sheets indicate total assets would increase from
K 60.3 million in 1985 to K 75.3 million in 1989. Correspondingly, total
Long-term debt will rise from K 25.5 million to K 39.3 million. In view of
the level of debt and in order to sustain a debt-equity ratio no greater than
75:25, Government's commitment of K 3.2 million of funds for the project to
ABPNC as equity is essential. An agreement was reached during negotiations
that ABPNG would not exceed a debt-equity ratio ceiling of 75:25 during the
project period. The 75:25 limit set for the bank is prudent in view of tbd
level of arrears, uncertainty in future sub-loan repayment performance and
expected provisions for bad debt in 1986-89. ABPNG's arrears situation is now
under control. However, to keep arrears at a manageable level, an agreement
was reached during negotiations that ABPNG would not exceed an arrears to
loans in repayment percentage of 20%.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRICES AND FIANCIL ANALYSIS
5.01      The project's aggregate incremental production, financial and
cconomic rates of return cannot be estimated since the actual mix of subloans
will depend on market forces.  Thus, detailed financial and economic analyses
have been conducted only on subprojects for which established farm models
exist: namely cocoa and oil palm. There are no illustrative models for
agricultural transport and equipment loans since each loan would vary from
each other in terms of size, type of vehicle or equipment, location, purpose,
etc. ABPNG has not developed specific farm models for poultry and piggery
enterprises owing to their diverse nature.



- 36 -
A. Production and Yield
5.02      Incremental production at full development of subprojects would be
about 7,325 tons of cocoa dry bean, and 121,260 tons of oil palm fresh fruit
bunches (ffb). Peak crop yields are expected to be as follows:
Tons per Hectare
100 ha cocoa ...................ss........    1.60 dry bean
20 ha cocoa...............................    1.75 dry bean
6 ha cocoa .....ee....e...................    1.25 dry bean
Oil palm... ...............................      18 ffb
The attainment of these yields is contingent upon good management services and
a high quality of tree crop establishment. The agronomic conditions, soil and
climate in the project areas are extremely favorable to the types of crops
being developed. Based on past experience under the Second Agricultural
Credit Project, cocoa is expected to yield about 1.25-1.75 tons/ha at full
maturity depending on the farm model. This is higher than most countries but
lower than the peak yield of about 3.0 tons/ha reached at Keravat Research
Station in PNG. Oil palm yields are expected to average about 18 tons ffb per
ha at full development comparable to the range of smallholder yields (19-24
tons ffb/ha) reported under a previous oil palm project in PNG. The projected
yields are below the 34-35 tons ffb/ha yield achieved on some nucleus estate
farms because soil conditions and management supervision would not be
uniformly ideal.
B. Markets
5.03      PNG's marketing arrangements are characterized by the relatively
small volumes handled, the very important role of the private sector, the
overwhelming orientation towards exports, and the high degree of organization
of collection, processing and sales. Smallholders usually sell their cocoa to
middlemen at roadside or to processors who in turn sell to exporters regis-
tered by the Cocoa Industry Board. Plantations sell directly to exporters in
processed form. The Cocoa Board assists effectively in orderly marketing and
price stabilization. It functions as an export regulatory agency, registering
processors and exporters, regulating the activities of buyers and dealers and
approving sales contracts. The Board also administers stabilization funds
obtained from levies on exports which provide a price support for cocoa.
Processing and sales of palm oil and kernels are handled by the nucleus estate
companies and their overseas representatives. In 1983, an oil palm commodity
stabilization fund was established to reduce the impact of fluctuations of
world prices on growers' incomes. As of December L984, the stabilization
funds for coffee, cocoa, copra and oil palm had accumulated reserves amounting
to K 159 million (US$168 million) with coffee accounting for more than half,
cocoa 30Z, oil palm 6% and, copra the remainder. Commercial pigs and poultry
are sold through well established marketing channels in the main population
areas. They represent a very small proportion of total production, which is
carried out (especially for pigs) by villagers for their own consumption. On



- 37 -
the whole, marketing of the main cash crops and commercial pigs and poultry in
PNG is well organized and functions properly.
5.04      No major difficulties are foreseen in marketing the incremental
production of this project given its insignificant size in relation to the
size of the world market, and specifically in view of the preferential treat-
ment accorded by Australia (priority in buying and duty-free status) to
imports from PNG. World trade in cocoa is currently about 1.5 million tons,
with PNG contributing 2Z. Project incremental production of 7,325 tons would
be only 0.5Z of world trade. This production would partially offset the 8,700
ton decline in PNG production since 1975 when PNG exports formed 2.4Z of world
trade. World exports of palm oil are about 3 million tons of which PNG's
share is more than 3Z. Palm oil accounts for 14% of world traee in edible
oils and fats, second only to soyabean oil. PNG's market share of palm oil
has been growing, and PNG now accounts for 30% of the annual increase of some
75,000 tons in world trade of oils and fats. In view of this the incremental
production of 27,900 tons over 11 years would be absorbed easily. PNG's share
of the 520,000 ton worLd trade in palm kernel and palm kernel oil is about
3Z. The incremental production increase of some 4,800 tons of palm kernel oil
would also not pose a marketing problem.
5.05      Pork and broiler meat would substitute for imports, and domestic
demand is expected to be strong. From 1973 to 1980, per capita chicken meat
consumption increased from 1.18 kg to 3.05 kg, and by 1985 this is anticipated
to rise to 3.21 kg. Project-induced production would represent a small
proportion of the present supply of broilers and pork, and thus would be
easily marketed. The meat would be sold in the main consumption centers of
Port Moresby, Lae, Highlands and Rabaul using existing retail channels which
should be adequate.
C. Price Structure
5.06      Farm inputs and outputs have been valued in terms of constant 1985
prices for both the farm budgets and economic analyses. Price projections
were based on world market price forecasts produced by the Bank's Comr,odity
Division, adjusted for transportation, processing and handling costs to the
farmgate. Annex 4, Table I gives the price structure for agricultural outputs
under the project. The cocoa price is currently US$2,081/ton in New York and
is expected to drop to US$1,724 in 1990. However, the price is projected to
increase by 15Z from 1990 to 1995, at which time the f.o.b. price is expected
to be about K 1,672/ton. The oil palm price, presently US$602/ton c.i.f.
Europe, is expected to decline by 10 over the next 10 years. The f.o.b.
price in 1995 is expected to be K 429/ton. The 1985 price of palm kernel is
US$411/ton c.i.f. Europe but is expected to decrease by 35Z over the period
1985-1995. The projected f.o.b. price in 1995 is about K 190/ton.
D. Financial Analysis
5.07      The main financial beneficiaries of the project would be small-
holders in the Eastern Highlands, North Solomons, Madang, East and West New



- 38 -
Britain Provinces. Borrowers for 6 ha cocoa and 4 ha oil palm development are
mostly settlers from overcrowded parts of the country. The 20 ha cocoa devel-
opment subloans are usually to traditional landowners who would form a
business group as a legal borrowing entity.  Each business group usually
consists of 10-15 families with each family head as a director in the business
group. With an average family size of 5, the group's total number is about 50
to 75 persons, with about 20-30 persons of working age who will work on the
block. Owners of the 100 ha cocoa estates could be: (a) a business group
usually composed of more than one hundred persons which has been organized to
take over an existing plantation from expatriate owners with financial assist-
ance from the Lands Department's Plantation Redistribution Acquisition Scheme;
(b) a business arm of a provincial government, local council or a church to
help raise funds for public welfare-related works; (c) a private company with
less than 25% foreign shareholding. Most of the loans are expected to fall
under the first two categories. Income of business group members ranges from
nil (self-sufficient subsistence farming with no cash transaction) to the
ownership of some coconut and a few old cocoa trees with yields less than
K 1,200 per family.
5.08      An analysis of financial costs, benefits and risks indicates the
subprojects would be financially attractive to the beneficiaries. The estima-
ted financial rates of return of typical investments to be financed under the
project are: 100 ha cocoa, 34%; 20 ha cocoa, 26%; 6 ha cocoa resettlement
scheme, 31X; and 4 ha oil palm, 45Z (See Annex 5 for details). Smallholder
family incomes can be calculated only for the 6 ha cocoa and 4 ha oil palm
models since the 120 ha and 20 ha cocoa farms would be jointly owned by a
number of families and clan groups. Incremental net cash family incomes p.a.
of US$2,898 (6 ha cocoa) and US$2,869 (4 ha oil palm) at maturity would repre-
sent significant increases over incomes without the project. The annual
outlay for fertilizer, chemicals, and other cash inputs would comprise only
102 and 9% of cocoa and oil palm gross revenues, respectively. Even if impu-
ted costs of labor are included, the operating costs would be 42% of cocoa
revenues and 29Z of oil palm revenues. Debt service is reasonable and would
amount to only 28Z and 18% of the net cash flow before debt service of the
6 ha cocoa and 4 ha oil palm farms, respectively. Such favorable financial
performance assumes optimal agronomic conditions. timely inputs, and profes-
sional management by private agencies and ABP1r staff which would be made
available to farmers. Details of projected farm production, production costs
and labor requirements under various farm models are given in project working
papers. The financial incentives to borrowers who would purchase agricultural
vehicles and equipment depends on the demand from smallholders and estates who
are being assisted by the project. Since the primary production activities
are expected to be highly profitable, the derived demand for transport, and
marketing facilities is expected to be substantial. The lending procedures,
and terms and conditions under the project would ensure that these subloans
are financially viable (paras. 3.20, 3.22, 4.06).



- 39 -
VI. BENEFITS, RISKS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
6.01      In addition to increased agricultural production (para. 5.01), the
project is expected to directly benefit about 3,400 smallholder families, 85%
of which are considered poor (earning less than K 275 per capita p.a.). It
would provide full-time employment for about 3,500 people, expand exports of
cocoa and oil palm and ensure a productive and sustainable use of under-
utilized land resources. The total value (in constant 1985 prices) of
project-related exports is estimated at about US$21.5 million annually at full
development, yielding revenues to COPNG of about US$0.6 million annually from
taxes. About 60% of the project costs are directed to the poor and the share
of the poor in total benefits is estimated to be about 70%. The project would
also have the beneficial effect of strengthening ABPNG as a development
financing institution, increasing its lending capability, and improving the
planning, supervision and implementation of subprojects. The expansion of
ABPNG's lending volume would maximize the use of existing staff and facilities
and result in the bank's improved financial condition in the long run.
Experience gained in the development of tree crops and livestock enterprises
would be useful in future expanded programs for the development of priority
agricultural areas.
B. Economic Analysis
6.02      The estimated economic rates of return (ERR) of the main farm models
are:
Table 6.1: ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
100 ha cocoa ............38
20 ha cocoa ..................30
6 ha cocoa ..............o... .......... o.o.o.oe*e.o22
4 ha oil palm ............ ..o...... o...o.. ooo..o....33
The benefit/cost analysis is made in border Kina. International prices have
been converted to Kina at the current exchange rate. Local prices have been
converted to border Kina using appropriate conversion factors (CF). A
standard CF of 0.965 has been used in converting m4st local costs to border
Kina since PNG has a relatively open economy, and except for labor wages, has
few price distortions. The current rural minimum wage rate is K 2.95 per day,
which is high compared to both the market wage and labor productivity.
Accordingly, ERRs for the farm models have been calculated using a CF for
labor of 0.65. Without project revenues are considered negligible: prior to
development, the estates are either abandoned or neglected, and in such poor
condition that revenues generated range from nil to barely enough to cover



- 40 -
maintenance costs. Similarly, the 6 ha farms are usually in various stages of
deterioration, with old and severely diseased trees yielding negligible
income. The 4 ha oil palm areas have been planted from 12-17 years ago and
yields are expected to be negligible without project development. The 20 ha
cocoa development areas are in an unimproved state normally covered by rain
forest. Annex 6, Table 1 shows the streams of costs and benefits used for the
economic analysis.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
6.03      Sensitivity analysis was used to determine which variable would be
most crucial to the success of the subproject. Crossover values for a 10l
discount rate, the opportunity cost of capital in PNG, reveal that farm
investments would be justified even with large reductions in revenues or
increases in costs (Table 6.2). The ERRs are not very sensitive to changes in
costs as costs can increase from 52% to 130Z without reducing the farm model
ERRs below 10%. Sensitivity to changes in cocoa and oil palm revenues is
small, and even if revenues are reduced individually by up to 56%, the
subproject returns would remain above 1OZ. Similarly, subproject benefits can
be delayed by three years and the ERRs would still be above 10%.

D. Risks
6.04      The primary project risk is ABPNG's capability to implement the
project adequately, in view of ABPNC's organizational problems coupled with a



- 41 -
borrowing clientele drawn from diverse culturaL backgrounds who may be enter-
ing the market-oriented economy for the first time. To reduce the likelihood
and potential impact of these risks, the project stresses the institutional
development of ASPNG through an Action Program and Financial Strategy, tech-
nical assistance, staff training and fellowships and the provision of adequate
vehicles and equipment. More efficient performance by the management agencies
which would be closely supervised by ABPNG, should ensure acceptabLe field
development quality, cost-effective operations, and mobilization of the
necessary amount of labor. As additional protection, the collection perfor-
mance and arrears position of the bank would be closeLy monitored. Taking the
above safeguards into account the project's indicated risks are judged
acceptable.
E. Environmental Impact
6.05      The areas to be developed agriculturally are presently under old
plantings, kunai grass (Imperata Cylindrica), often in undulating or steeper
topography. The project would make more efficient use of existing land
resources and help reduce uncontrolled shifting cultivation in highly erodable
terrain by establishing tree crops in a stable, long-term agricultural system
which would preserve favorable ecoLogical conditions.
VII. ACREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government
that:
(a) with respect to the subsidy payments to ABPNG (para. 2.30):
(i   the subsidy would not exceed K 12 million between January 1,
1986 and December 31, 1988;
(ii) the level of subsidies and interest rates would be reviewed
Annually with the Bank, commencing not later than December 31,
1986 with a view to:
1. monitoring the level of subsidies and their impact on
subloan demand;
2. assessing the effectiveness of the subsidies;
3. identifying other incentives for stimulating smallholder
production; and
4. making recommendations for reduction of interest rate
subsidy during the implementation period of the project.
(b) credit related investments would be completed using Government
and/or ABPNC funds beyond the termination of project funding
(para. 3.02);



- 42 -
(c) Government would ezamine on a quarterly basis the cost coefficients
used in calculating prices for smallholders in order to ensure that
farmers are adequately compensated for their produce (para 4.09).
7.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached with ABPNG that:
(a) the interest rate subsidies would be directed to individuaL farmers
or groups of farmers living at or below the poverty level (estimated
by the World Bank to be about K 275 per capita p.a.) (para. 2.30);
(b) an annual program for lending to new crops and other agricultural
projects including the technical, economic and financial justifica-
tion for such lending would be submitted to the Bank for review and
approval two months prior to the start of ABPNG's fiscal year (para.
3.09);
tc) the training component of the project would be carried out under a
plan agreed with the Bank (para. 3.15);
(d) all subloans above K 120,000 with appraisal reports on the
technical, marketing, financial and economic feasibility of the sub-
projects would be submitted to the Bank for approval prior to the
approval of the subloans by ABPNG (para. 3.22);
(e) separate project accounts which would be available for Bank
ezamination as requested would be maintained (para. 3.24);
(f) annual audits of ABPNG accounts would be carried out by independent
auditors on behalf of the Auditor General in accordance with the
Illustrated Form of Audit of Development Finance Companies and
submitted to the Bank within six months of the closing of the fiscal
year (para. 3.24);
(g) the Action Program and Financial Strategy outlined in Amnex 3 would
be undertaken according to the timetable indicated therein
(para. 4.03); and
(h) ABPNG would not exceed a debt-equity ratio ceiling of 75:25 and an
arrears to loans in repayment percentage of 202 (para. 4.12).
7.03      Conditions of effectiveness would be (a) appointment of a suitably
qualified individual as Deputy Managing Director (para. 2.07) and (b) signing
of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement acceptable to the Bank between Government and
ABPNG (para. 3.19).
7.04      Subject to the above, the project would be suitable for a Bank loan
to GOPNG of US$18.8 million equivalent, and retroactive financing of up to
US$1.8 million for eligible expenditures after March 1, 1985. The loan would
be for 16 years including 7 years of grace at the standard variable rate.
