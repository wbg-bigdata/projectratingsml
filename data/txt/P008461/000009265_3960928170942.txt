MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGAR
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
FOR AN INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Narional Bank of Hungary for US$100 million equivalent, to help finance an
integrated agricultural export project, is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have fifteen years maturity with five years grace and
carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.          Background.  Hungary has about 20 percent of its economically
active population working on farms or in agricultural enterprises.
Agriculture contributes about one-fifth of GDP and accounts for about 30
percent of convertible currency exports; its substantial exports to the
countries which are members of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance
(CMEA) have a significant potential to be converted in a relatively short time
into higher quality goods for Western markets. Agriculture is important in
every phase of the economic, social and political life in the country, and its
leaders recognize the vital role it plays in the successful development of the
ongoing economic reform. Under these circumstances, the Bank has gradually
broadened its dialogue with the Government on agr_cultural policy and
institutional issues. Key sector issues which the Bank is currently pursuing
with the Government include: (a) clarifying the ownership of assets in
agriculture by individuals, which is essential for the development of a land
market, transformation of present cooperatives to other organizational forms,
and liquidation of loss-making large scale farms; (b) reduction of
agricultural subsidies, particularly on production and investment;
(c) reduction of licensing of imports of agricultural proo.ucts; and
(d) developing an effective marketing system.
3.            3ank Assistance Strateog.  Since lending to Hungary began in
1983, the Bank's country assistance strategy has focussed on supporting the
Government's program of reform and structural adjustment to make the economy
more efficient, flexible, market-oriented and competitive, especially in
convertible currency markets. This strategy has been implemented mainly
through a series of hybrid loans for industrial restructuring, combining quick
disbursing funds to support institutional and policy reform, and investment
funds to support restructuring at the enterprise and subsector levels.
Investment loans in other sectors, in particular in agriculture end transport,
have also supported implementation of the reform, as well as improvement in
enterprise efficiency. Following the adoption by the Government in 1987 of a
medium-term program of stabilization and adjustment to correct imbalances
created by economic deterioration, the Bank stepped up its support to the
reform through an industrial sector adjustment loan. This loan, combined with
an IMP Standby in 1988, provided crucial external support to strengthen the
Government's reform and adjustment efforts. The Bank's strategy will continue
to focus on support to the Government in carrying out its adjustment efforts



- S -
,qod xill also address medium to long term constraints to sustainable growth,
assist in developing institutional capacity in line with systemic reforms and
hollp ensure Hungary's continued access to external financing. This strategy
ill. be implemented through both adjustment and investment lending operations.
Rationale for Bagnk Involvement.  The Bank has so far made four
iifvrstment loans in the agricultural and agroprocessing sectors that have been
Of>rtLiVe in supporting economic reform and structural change. These
investment loans, complemented by an active policy dialogue between the Bank
afnd covernment, have helped d- elop new approaches to old problems and have
ach erved the following results: (a) incorporating economic and financial
rr4x'lis. in all investment decisions; (b) discontinuing highly subsidized
Pr(JuZceion programs of soybeans, corn and land improvement; (c) phasing out
administrative controls on producer prices; (d) reducing overall subsidies to
the sector; (e) establishing export marketing services for agricultural
products; and (f) breaking up the commodity trusts in poultry, meat and
grains.
However, several problems remain in the sector, and these are
addressed by the present project. First, and most important, is the issue of
transfer of ownership of assets (including, particularly, land) held by the
cooperatives to their members or other individuals. The development of the
land market and the use of land as collateral for securing commercial bank
loauns are essential for achieving the Government-supported growth of the
private sector in agriculture. Second, it is important to pursue continued
subsidy reduction and to rationalize the tax system in order to accelerate the
needed restructuring of agricultural enterprises. Enterprises that are not
profitable would be subjected to liquidation through legal processes and be
required to sell off their assets in the event that they cannot restructure
their operations and obtain the needed credit. A third area of concern is the
lack of adequate development and liberalization of domestic and exr. t
iwarketing in terms of policy, legal framework, institutional strengthening,
marketing services and marketing infrastructure. Continued Bank involvement
through the project supports significant progress in these areas toward the
transition to a more efficient agricultural sector.
6.          Projec  lbiectives.  The objectives of the project are to:
(a) provide quality food products for export; and (b) make agricultural
producers more efficient by providing financial resources to private, small
scale farmers and by improving agribusiness methods and managerial practices
of large scale farms. It also supports basic changes in the redistribution of
assets in agriculture to members of cooperatives and others through
c-gislative and other measures for ownership reform and land market
development; and an accelerated withdrawal of Government control and influence
at the farm level through deregulated producer r-4ces, reduced subsidies and
product neutrality of the remaining subsidies. fiinally, it provides training
and technical services for the development of the domestic market.
7.          Project DescriRtion.  The project would provide a line of credit
co einable agricultural enterprises (both large scale agricultural units and
private, small scale farms) to improve their operations, reduce their
p-odu.ction costs and increase their contribution towards exports. Investment



funds would finance planting material, breeding stock, equipment for the
improvement of crop and livestock production, limited non-agricultural
activities!/ of agricultural enterprises, storage and commodity handling
facilities, and marketing and sales promotion. Technical services in business
planning and marketing used by project beneficiaries would be financed by
project proceeds. In addition, the project would provide training and
technical services that would facilitate the transformation of agriculture
toward a market economy and support to small scale farmers. These services
include training in farm management and extension services, training of
executives in food and commodity marketing, commodity exchange development,
market information services, agricultural insurance, and livestock advisory
services. This component would be financed by OECD donor grants, most of
which have already been committed. While the Government continues to seek
donor financing for the remainder, it has undertaken to assure the provision
of resources to implement this project component. The project would also
ensure that existing regulations for environmental protection, particularly
from water pollution, are enforced on farms receiving credit under the loan.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A set of three maps is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8337-HU dated May 15, 1990, is also attached.
8.          Potential project beneficiaries can be categorized into two
groups. The first group includes private, usually small scale, farmers; part
time farmers who are members of agricultural cooperatives and employees of
state farms; farmers organized into groups; and contractors of farm services
and rural entrepreneurs engaged in activities supporting agriculture or
agroprocessing enterprises. The second group includes large scale farms and
their subsidiaries, and agents engaged in the marketing and processing of
agricultural products. Large scale farms would draw up business plans so as
to restructure their operations, reduce production costs and improve
profitability and would obtain financing from commercial banks on the basis of
such plans.
9.          Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, the Government agreed to
undertake the following agricultural Rolicy actions: (a) (i) maintain and
monitor its program for the reduction of subsidies in the agricultural sector,
so as to be consistent with the Government's overall subsidy reduction
program; (ii) reduce, by December 31, 1990, all agricultural subsidies by at
least one third of those in effect during the 1989 calendar year calculated in
current prices; and (iii) review with the Bank before the end of each calendar
year, beginning in 1990, the subsidy reduction in the past year and the target
for the next year, and take into account Bank comments on the target in
preparing its proposal for the following year; (b) revise the income support
program for farmers on poor quality land by Decemb4r 31, 1991 and the
V Non-agricultural activities include a variety of small scale
agroprocessing activities, services and small manufactured goods such as
office furniture, plastic products and household novelties.

investment tax credit by December 31, 1992 so as not to determine or
influence the production of any specific cr'p or livestock at the farm level:
(c) submit draft legislation to the legislature by June 30, 1991 providing for
the possibility of, and the conditions for, the assignment of ownership rights
in the net assets (other than agricultural land) of the cooperatives to their
members and the definition of ownership rights in agricultural land;
(d) develop an agricultural land market by adopting by December 31, 1991
regulations which require all farms to include on their balance sheets, for
accounting purposes, land as an asset with notional value; (e) take all
measures necessazy by June 30, 1991 to make agricultural land mortgageable for
commercial bank loans; (f) liquidate large scale farms enrolled in the debt
reduction program (1987-90) and subsequent programs that 'aii to meet agreed
financial targets and have been determined to be insolvent (under this program
234 large scale farms undertook to restructure and meet agreed profitability
targets over a three-year rolling period in exchange for partial debt write
down and rescheduling); and (g) agree, by December 31, 1991, on a plan for
reducing import licensing of major agricultural products.
10.         It was also igreed at negotiations that the NBH and the
participating banks would undertake the following project actions: (a) require
large scale sub-borrowers to have and maintain a sound financial position
including a debt to equity ratio of not more than 65:35, a debt service
coverage ratio of not less than 1.5:1, and a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of not less than 1.3:1; (b) ensure an ERR and FCR of at
least 12 percent for each subproject financed; (c) have each large scale sub-
borrower prevare a business plan with detailed operational, financial, and
marketing a angements; and (d) ensure that all subborrowers have their
investment projects approved by the Ministry of Environment to be in
compliance with the country's safety, health, and environmental standards,
which have been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. Small scale
farmers seeking loans would be required to have farming experience, present a
farm plan and demonstrate a capacity to repay the loan. Participating banks
would train their credit office s in dealing with small scale farmers and'
place experienced staff in bra- hes with a large number of small farmer loans.
Loans made by the participati' banks to the final beneficiaries will have
maturities of not more than 1   tars, including a maximum grace period of
three years.
11.         Technical servi ss and training would be organized in order to
support: (a) private, small "ale farmer development; (b) wholesale and
domestic market de-elopment and commodity exchange establishment; (c) local
consultant industry to support business planning; (d) agricultural insurance
schemes; and (e) livestock advisory services. It is expected that the
technical services and training component of the project would be financed by
grant funds from OECD countries either on a bilateral or multilateral basis.
Based on discussion with Bank staff, the EEC has made a commitment to finance
part of the package of technical services and training defined under the
project. The signing of subsidiary loan agreements between NBH and two
eligible intermediary banks would be a condition of Bank loan effectiveness.
The loan would provide retroactive financing of eligible subloans to private
farmers contracted after January 1, 1990, which would amount to less than
US$10 million, or 10 percent of the loan amount.

12.         Benefits.  Project benefits would be derived from: (a) increased
earnings from exports, mainly to convertible currency markets; (b) increases
in the value added of the products processed under the project; and
(c) transfer of the ownership of assets, including land, from the state farms
and cooperatives to farmers either organized in groups or as individuals. The
project would support preinvestment work for future market infrastructure
development. The elimination of most subsidies, liberalization of producer
prices and import licensing would improve resource allocation and efficiency
in agriculture and the economy at large. Market prices and market interest
rates are expected to improve investment efficiency and benefit investors and
commercial banks as well as consumers. The project would thus support the
development of a cohesive, domestic, product market which allocates resources
based on supply and demand.
13.        Risks.  The major risks of the project include inadequate
implementation by the Government of the agreed policy reforms and insufficient
incentives to managers of large scale farms and agroprocessing enterprises so
as to motivate them to carry out the required restructuring of their farms and
enterprises. Besides political will and determination, these issues involve
policy formulation and implementation capacity of the Government, and
institutional strengthening and business planning at the enterprise level.
The project attempts to reduce these risks by addressing selected policy
issues which are also being pursued under the proposed Structural Adjustment
Loan, and by including in the project, technical services to assist farm
managers in identifyirg markets and organizing production to meet their
quality and quantity requirements. The project also provides the opportunity
for the large farms to develop business planning as a tool for adopting modern
financial, commercial and managerial practices and to small scale farmers to
become effective owner-operators b. providinb them with incentives such as
access to credit, export marketing sarvices and technical services. As
regards the environmental impact of the project, the potential unfavorable
effect would mainly consist of air and water pollution resulting from
agroprocessing activities and ground and surface water pollution resulting
from farm chemicals. However, the Government is strengthening its enforcement
of regulations governing air and water pollution, and the investment proposal
of each subborrower will be cleared with the Ministry of Environment.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
