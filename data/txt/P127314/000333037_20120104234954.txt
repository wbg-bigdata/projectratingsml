Program Development      This program document proposes a one-tranche eighth poverty reduction
Objective(s) and         support grant for SDR64.5 million (US$100 million equivalent) to the
Contribution to CAS      Republic of Ghana. This second Development Policy Operation of a
                         programmatic series of two (PRSC7 and PRSG8) supports the authorities’
                         efforts to consolidate ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the
                         development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development
                         Agenda for 2010-2013. The Agenda emphasizes the need for
                         macroeconomic stabilization and greater public sector efficiency and
                         executive transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for
                         the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through
                         agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development.
                         Specifically, the PRSG8 supports continuing and deepening policy reforms
                         initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and financial stability
                         and (ii) foster public sector reform and strengthen sustainability in the
                         energy sector, while (iii) protecting the poor and (iv) developing the oil and
                         gas institutional framework. The proposed operation is aligned with the
                         World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY08-12 and with the
                         World Bank’s Strategy for Africa.

Risks and Risk           The proposed operation comprises the following potential risks:
Mitigation               (i) Political feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment (opposition to
                         increased tariffs and taxes, large wage bill increases, and demand for new
                         investment programs financed with current and future oil revenues) with
                         new elections looming, which could re-ignite inflation, impair debt
                         sustainability and further increase banks’ vulnerabilities. The proposed
                         programmatic operation mitigate some of these risks of fiscal slippages by
                         supporting actions to          prevent further public expenditure arrears
                         accumulation, strengthen cost-recovery mechanisms in utilities, and

                                               vii
               implement the second financial sector strategic plan for greater financial
               stability. Risks are also mitigated by demand for good governance activities
               supported by the World Bank, as well as the centralization of the public
               wage negotiations scheme through the adoption of the Single Spine Salary
               Structure; (ii) External risks associated to a deteriorated global economic
               environment, affecting Ghana’s terms of trade, remittances and official
               development assistance from OECD countries. Better initial conditions (high
               foreign currency reserves, low public financing needs, stable inflation
               expectations), oil-related stabilization mechanisms (hedging scheme,
               stabilization fund), would reduce the impact of external shocks on the
               domestic economy and balance of payments; (iii) Implementation risks, as
               actions supported by the series mostly comprise policy designs and
               approvals. Ghana’s recent track record of reforms indeed suggests that,
               while necessary, policy approvals do not always constitute sufficient
               conditions for implementation. Besides, larger resort to non concessional
               financing for public investment could also affect the quality of project
               implementation. The complementarity of the proposed programmatic
               operation with ongoing World Bank projects in PFM, energy, public sector
               reform (decentralization) and social protection mitigate such risks; (iv)
               Energy-related risks of various natures, including lower rains than expected,
               lower flows of gas from Nigeria than planned, delays in Ghana gas
               infrastructure completion, which could all have negative implications for
               budget execution (through the accrual of larger contingent liabilities in
               electricity utilities). The implementation of the automatic tariff adjustment
               mechanism supported by the proposed programmatic operation reduce such
               risks; (v) Natural disasters, given the relatively high exposure of Ghana’s
               population to multiple natural hazards, in particular in the North were
               poverty is concentrated. The adoption of the common targeting mechanism
               supported by the proposed operation reduces such risks, and is
               complemented by several other Government, World Bank and DPs activities
               to expand social protection and economic opportunities in the North.

                                         1. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a one-tranche Eighth Poverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSG8) for SDR64.5 million (US$100 million equivalent) to the Republic of Ghana.
This second and final Development Policy Operation (DPO) of a programmatic series of two
(PRSC7 and PRSG8) supports the authorities’ efforts to consolidate ongoing fiscal stabilization
efforts and protect the development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development
Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic
stabilization, greater public sector efficiency and executive transparency and accountability to
provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through
agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. Specifically, the
PRSG8 supports continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore
budgetary discipline and financial stability and (ii) foster public sector reform and strengthen
sustainability in the energy sector, while (iii) protecting the poor and (iv) developing the oil and
gas institutional framework. The proposed operation is aligned with the World Bank Group’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY08-121 and with the World Bank’s Strategy for Africa.
2.      Since 2009, Ghana is engaged into a multi-year macroeconomic stabilization
program to bring back its fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track. The Ghanaian
economy was hard hit in 2007 and 2008 by a cumulative series of shocks (droughts, floods, fuel,
food, and financial crises), which exacerbated a structural trend of widening fiscal imbalances,
and exposed the economy to the need for sharp correction. Indeed, by end-2008, fiscal (on a
commitment basis) and current account (including official transfers) deficits, including grants,
respectively culminated at 12.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP and annual inflation was running at two
digits. In response, the Government adopted in 2009 a multi-year stabilization program which
received the financial and technical support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
Development Partners (DPs), including the World Bank.
3.      Stabilization gains made since 2009 now need to be consolidated to pave the way for
a developmental and sustainable use of oil revenue flowing since December 2010. Since 2009,
the economy has shown strong signs of stabilization, while weathering the impact of the global
financial crisis. Both fiscal and current account deficits were significantly reduced, the exchange
rate was stabilized and consumer price inflation decelerated to single digit levels. The
methodology to compute national accounts was also updated, portraying a much richer economy
than previously measured and a more sustainable external debt. Following a sharp adjustment in
2009, economic growth rebounded in 2010 (7.7 percent) and is projected to reach 13.6 percent in
2011, pulled by continued favorable terms of trade and the onset of oil production on a full-year
basis. The challenge is for Ghana to fully take advantage of these positive - but maybe temporary
- factors to decisively propel its economy to a higher development and poverty reduction
trajectory. This calls for continued structural reforms to avoid boom and bust cycles (public
financial management, financial sector regulation, energy-related stabilization mechanisms),
reinforce households’ protection against various risks (including from the negative impact of
exchange rate appreciation on agriculture and land prices), address regional disparities, and

further strengthen Ghana’s governance architecture (public sector reform, decentralization, oil and
gas regulatory frameworks).
4.      The PRSG8 is fully aligned with the harmonized Multi-Donor Budget Support
(MDBS) process. The World Bank was a founding member of the MDBS initiative and has been
the permanent co-chair of the group since its inception in 2003. The MDBS process is a central
instrument of aid harmonization in Ghana. It includes the identification with the Government of a
selective joint matrix of policy actions to be supported by Development Partners, aligning their
monitoring and evaluation frameworks through a common rolling 3-year Progress Assessment
Framework (PAF). In line with principles agreed upon between the Government and
Development Partners in the MDBS Framework Memorandum, the PRSG8 ideally aims to be
disbursed in the very first months of Ghana’s fiscal year (January 1-December 31), see Annex 1.
5.      The proposed operation is part of a larger program of support to Ghana that notably
focuses on public financial management, public sector reform, energy, agriculture and
social protection. Following the board approval in FY10 of investment lending projects for
public financial management (US$28 million), electricity distribution (US$70 million), and social
protection (US$89 million), the board approved in FY11 investment lending projects for land
administration (US$50 million), local government capacity (US$175 million), oil and gas
capacity (US$38 million), and skills development (US$70 million). It also approved the PRSC7
(US$215 million) and the third agriculture development policy operation (US$57 million). In
FY12 were approved the Statistics Development Program (US$30 million) and the West Africa
Fisheries Project (US$50 million).

       2. GHANA’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

                             A.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.       The Government elected in January 2009 inherited a difficult macro-economic
situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a structural trend of widening
fiscal imbalances. Rapid fiscal expansion in 2008 and the sudden closure of access to
international capital markets in September 2008 resulted in a widening current account deficit and
a contracting capital account surplus, reducing the stock of gross foreign currency reserves at the
Bank of Ghana to less than 2.3 months of imports. By end-2008, fiscal (on a cash basis) and
current account deficits, including grants, respectively culminated at 8.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP.
While fiscal expansion was prolonging trends observed since 2005 – with a public sector wage
bill to revenue ratio growing from 34 to 57 percent between 2004 and 2008 – it was also the result
of a combination of severe exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late 2007, a rise in
world food prices, which prompted the Government to introduce food tax exemptions, and a rise
in oil prices, which led the Government to purchase oil on behalf of utilities, in the absence of
effective tariff adjustment mechanisms. The electoral cycle also contributed to the fiscal
expansion, as observed during previous elections. Deficits and demand pressures strongly
contributed to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost approximately 45 percent of its
value against the US dollar over June 2008 to June 2009, and to accelerated consumer price
inflation, which culminated at 20.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2009.
7.     In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal stabilization
plan, to bring back the fiscal deficit and debt to GDP ratios to sustainable levels by 2011.
These intentions were reflected in the successive Budget Laws 2009, 2010 and 2011 approved by
Parliament, targeting end-year fiscal deficits (on a cash basis) at 5.5, 4.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP
in CY09, CY10 and CY11.
8.      While not meeting all initial expectations, progress to stabilize the economy was
nonetheless significant since 2009. Indeed, fiscal deficits exceeded budget targets in CY09 and
CY10, see Table 2 and 3, deviations being particularly large in CY10. Chief among the factors to
explain such aggregate budget deviations was the progressive discovery of Government
outstanding financial commitments – and related expenditure arrears, contracted before 2009 vis-
à-vis private firms (for energy and road projects) and public utilities, and their continued
accumulation while effective commitment controls and cost-recovery mechanisms were
progressively implemented. Nonetheless, fiscal deficits were significantly compressed, from 8.5
percent and 12.5 percent of GDP in 2008 on cash and commitment basis respectively, to a
projected 4.6 and 2.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Improved revenue collection, contained primary
expenditures (excluding the clearance of arrears and debt service) and rapid growth contributed to
improve the fiscal situation. The contraction of the current account in the balance of payments,
and the initial massive support of international financial institutions in 20092, combined with
favorable terms of trade (declining oil prices, surging cocoa and gold prices) contributed to
replenish foreign currency reserves, stabilize the exchange rate, and contain imported inflation.
Good domestic food production, reduced public demand and credit to private sector, also
contributed to lower consumer price inflation to single-digit levels and build positive medium
term expectations, thereby giving further credibility to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) inflation

  The IDA Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit, the IMF Extended Credit Facility and the decision
from the G20 in March 2009 to raise special drawing rights (SDR) for developing countries in response to the
financial crisis allowed Ghana to benefit from a cumulated net inflow of US$700 million in 2009, which came in
addition to earlier commitments.

targeting regime. As inflation was decelerating, the BoG reduced its policy rate from 17.0 percent
in December 2008 to 12.5 percent in October 2011. Meanwhile, interest paid on 6-month
Treasury bills went down from 26.3 to 9.8 percent over the same period.
9.      Following the sharp adjustment of 2009, GDP growth strongly rebounded in 2010
and 2011. As Government strongly compressed its demand in 2009, without being immediately
relayed by private domestic investors and consumers, economic growth strongly decelerated in
2009 to 4.0 percent (down from 8.4 percent in 2008). It nonetheless rapidly rebounded in 2010 to
7.7 percent, under the influence of various factors. First, unlike 2009 (where fiscal compression
cost 2.5-3.0 percentage points of foregone GDP growth, not accounting for multiplier effects),
public demand contributed positively to total aggregate demand; second, growing export revenue
(gold and cocoa) stimulated private demand; third, the progressive resumption of credit to private
sector and utilities restored their ability to operate at full capacity; and fourth, the growing
likelihood of first oil (which eventually became a reality in December 2010, as planned)
encouraged private operators to invest and build stocks in anticipation of growing demand in
2011 (a projected 13.6 percent real GDP growth). While declining in proportion of GDP (as
services – ICT, construction, and the oil industry grew faster over the same period), agricultural
GDP growth, benefiting from good rains and greater use of fertilizers, nonetheless remained
largely positive in per capita terms since 2008.
10.     Economic growth and the clearance of many public arrears contributed to
strengthen financial sector’s balance sheets, which nevertheless still remain fragile. The
adjustment of 2009 also concerned the financial sector (mostly constituted of banks), which
experienced in that year a strong deterioration of its assets, as the proportion of non-performing
loans (NPLs) in gross loans grew from 8 percent in December 2008 to 20 percent in February
2010. In retrospect, the rapid expansion of credit in 2007 and 2008 in a high inflation and high
interest rate environment created conditions for the subsequent asset deterioration, as risk
management regulations and practices did not improve commensurately. Another major reason
was the accumulation of public arrears impairing banks’ assets due directly to the build-up of
public arrears to contractors and SOEs, and indirectly to arrears to vendors not paid by the
affected contractors and SOEs, see Table 1. Beyond late releases (carryovers), projects arrears
with contractors3 originated mostly from the relaxation of commitment controls since 2008 in
energy, roads & highway ministries, and the absence of a contracts database enabling proper
multi-year investment planning, while outstanding obligations to SOEs originated mostly from
the absence of cost-recovery mechanisms in utilities, see Section 4B. Finally, the Consolidated
Fund, although legally bound, accumulated some arrears vis-à-vis Statutory Funds (Ghana
Education Trust Fund, Road Fund, District Assembly Common Fund, National Health Insurance
Fund, Social Security, HPIC and MDRI related funds). In total, arrears and outstanding
obligations rose from 6.0 percent of GDP in 2008 to 8.2 percent in 2010. In the event, State-
Owned Banks saw their financial situation deteriorate given their high exposure to State-Owned
Enterprises. Nevertheless, the clearance of a significant portion of arrears by the Government in
2010 and 2011, and the expansion of balance sheets with growth contributed to reduce the
proportion of NPLs (to 16 percent in October 2011) and reduce the prudential need for banks to
provision them. Thus, banks progressively resumed credit to the private sector, after it had
stagnated in real terms from end-2008 until October 2010. Besides, capital adequacy ratios were
improved through higher capital requirements fulfilled between 2009 and 2011.

11.     Since 2009, the Balance of Payments was strengthened. In 2010, the current account
widened, as import sharply rebounded from their low level of 2009 and in spite of continued
robust export growth and growing transfers. The current account deficit was nonetheless more
than financed by large capital inflows, including foreign direct investments for the oil industry
and bond purchases from non residents. Government external borrowing, mostly on concessional
terms, was also significant in 2010, at about US$ 2.8 billion. Further supported by oil exports in
2011, gross international reserves at the Bank of Ghana reached US$4.7 billion in December 2010
(3.0 months of imports) and are projected at US$5.4 billion (3.1 months of imports) by end 2011,
up from US$2.0 billion (2.2 months of imports) by end 2008. By mid-2011, exports receipts,
(including oil), were US$2.5 billion higher than that of the same period in 2010 (including
US$1.2 billion worth of crude oil exports), allowing imports to increase by almost the same
amount without negatively affecting the current account balance. From 8.2 percent of GDP in
2010, the current account deficit is projected to amount to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2011.

               B.      MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

12.     By May 2011, IMF was considering Ghana on track to meet its immediate
macroeconomic targets: reduced fiscal imbalances (a positive basic primary balance from
2011), increased foreign currency reserves, reduced stock of arrears, and contained price
inflation to single digit levels. The IMF Article IV and ECF third and fourth reviews from May
2011 consider Ghana’s external and growth prospects as favorable, driven by high export prices
and oil production, assuming that fiscal vulnerabilities are addressed through structural reforms.
Indeed, unless public expenditure arrears are regularized, this would pose risks to corporate
liquidity and banks. Besides, persistent large public financing needs could fuel inflation and
currency instability. The fifth ECF review, covering the period from January to June 2011 and the
preparation of the Budget 2012, took place in October 2011, for a scheduled IMF Board
discussion on December 14, 2011 (see Annex 6).
13.      Not being greatly exposed to international financial markets (on both assets and
liabilities sides), Ghana’s financial sector was able to withstand the global financial crisis of
2008 and is likely to withstand as well the current one originating from the United States
and the Euro zone. One some grounds, Ghana could actually benefit from global financial
turbulences, through their impact on gold prices. But weak risk management, accounting,
competition and governance practices, and the dominance of the state-owned banks need to be
addressed to achieve long term financial viability. Strengthening Bank of Ghana supervision
capacity and resolution powers, credit enforcement, and competition in the financial sector is also
required to improve access to credit, to small and medium enterprises in particular.
14.     While expenditure controls are being strengthened, most of the fiscal adjustment
from 2011 will be stemming from improved revenue collection. Since 2009, major efforts were
undertaken by the Government to reinforce expenditure controls, the lack thereof being at the
origin of the widening of public deficits up to 2008: uncontrollable public sector remunerations in
the absence of central negotiations mechanism and payroll management; large energy subsidies in
the absence of cost-recovery mechanisms; rapid project arrears accumulation in the absence of
commitment controls; and a general lack of fiscal transparency allowing fiscal imbalances to
widen as unnoticed. And while significant progress was made since 2009 to address these issues,
see section 4B, thus reducing the likelihood of further expenditure slippage in the near future, the
upward revision in GDP also led authorities to realize Ghana’s poor domestic revenue collection,
at 14.4 percent of GDP in 2010, that is much below the average of the group of lower middle
income countries than Ghana just joined. Thus, by November 2011, revenue (excluding grants)
was projected to rise sharply in 2011 (18.1 percent of GDP) and beyond (18.7 percent in 2013), as
oil and non oil revenue should grow significantly compared with 2010. In 2011, authorities
project an oil revenue equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP. As far as non-oil revenue is concerned,
authorities bank on broadening the tax base (communication service tax, VAT for financial
services), on improving tax administration (in ports notably, where revenue rose by 40 percent in
Q1 2011 as compliance was strengthened after public reports of large abuse, and in the mining
sector), and streamlining exemptions. Figures up to September 2011 were consistent with the
planned fiscal consolidation.
15.     The Government fiscal strategy also foresees the clearance of remaining arrears in
2011 and 2012. Given their impact on firms’ liquidity and ability to operate, financial sector’s
assets quality, and public investment project completion, the Government sees arrears
regularization vis-à-vis private contractors, SOEs and Statutory Funds as a key pillar of its fiscal
consolidation strategy. The strategy includes a combination of cash payments and bond issuance,


                                             -8-
accounting for Government’s cash flow and the inflationary impact of cash injection in the
economy. In 2011, the Government plans to regularize GH¢2,350 million worth of arrears (4.0
percent of GDP), and another GH¢101 million in 2012 to leave a stock of arrears to contractors,
and SOEs at GH¢1,349 million (2.0 percent of GDP) by end-2012, see Table 1.
16.     In 2012, the Government intends to develop a large public investment plan. Per the
Budget Statement for the Financial Year 2012 approved by Parliament on December 6, 2011, the
public investment plan is to be mostly financed externally. The public investment plan foresees
notably the rapid completion of the gas infrastructure, with a view to augment oil production
capacity and lower electricity generation costs, see Section 4B.
17.     The Government strategy is not immune from risks, as mounting political pressures
for fiscal expansion and public sector wage increases could significantly undermine
Government fiscal consolidation plans. Risks lie in particular in Government’s ability to
negotiate with unions a within-budget public wage increase and a gradual implementation of the
“single spine? reform,4,5 succeed in significantly raising taxes, and contain domestically financed
capital expenditures. The onset of oil production, the announcement of higher financial resources
through greater South-South cooperation, and the higher statistical GDP have indeed, without
doubt, led to high expectations among population that Ghana will soon join a group of oil rich
countries and that this will provide a large part of what is needed – improved service delivery and
infrastructure. This in a broader context of very competitive politics and a repeated history of
macroeconomic slippages ahead of general elections, the next one being scheduled for end-2012.
Furthermore, a continued deterioration of the global economic environment -- worsening terms of
trade, declining remittances and official development assistance from OECD countries, would
inevitably amplify the impact of potential fiscal slippages on macroeconomic stability.
18.     However, risks of macroeconomic instability ahead of elections are probably lower
today than in 2008. Beyond Government’s commitment to protect macroeconomic stability in
2012, as clearly stated in the Budget Statement 2012, a number of factors could mitigate such
risks. Firstly, the initial macroeconomic conditions are much better today than they were in early
2008: high economic growth, substantial foreign reserves, low public financing needs, and stable
inflation expectations from the population. Secondly, control systems are now in place to prevent
uncontrolled fiscal slippages: commitment controls, automatic cost-recovery mechanisms, a
centralized wage negotiation system, the petroleum price hedging mechanism and the Petroleum
stabilization fund.6 Last but not least, there is possibly increasing awareness in Ghana of the costs
of large political business cycles. Gaining from the experience of democratic transitions in
power, political parties now factor in the fact that no election will be their last, encouraging them
to take a longer term view. The private sector is also emerging as a key swing voter against
parties willing to sacrifice the nation’s investment climate for reelection. Finally, organized

   In August 2011, The Government and Organized Labor agreed on a 20 percent increase in base pay and on the
Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) and on a 1.7 percentage point relativity. Given the policy of automatic
promotion, this means that nominal individual remunerations of public servants, excluding other promotion and
allowances, will go up by 22 percent in 2011 compared with 2010. Besides, the SSSS is effective for all public sector
employees since January 1, 2010. Hence, retroactive payments shall be honored for those transferred to the SSSS
after this date and the Government plans to do so between 2011 (0.5 percent of GDP) and 2012 (1.4 percent of GDP),
under the assumption that all public sector employees will have been migrated to the SSSS by end-2011.
6
  In 2012, 1.3 percent of GDP (see Table 3) will be saved in Petroleum Funds (Stabilization and Heritage Funds) per
the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 815 approved in April 2011.

groups of citizens are increasingly demanding accountability from government – as reflected in
civil society advocacy for responsible petroleum revenue management or independent budget
analysis among many other examples.
19.      Besides, the arrival of oil brings additional challenges to the quality of growth and its
pro-poor nature. Oil, through its impact on Government revenue, will almost inevitably boost
growth in the next years through demand effects. But it will also exacerbate a number of already
existing challenges related to governance (in oil and gas sectors, and more broadly in the
management of public resources), volatility (prices, oil reserves uncertainty), agricultural
competitiveness and geographical disparities (North-South notably, see Section 2C). Ghana’s
ability to address these challenges will have a major influence on longer term growth and poverty
alleviation. The World Bank report on the economy-wide impact of oil discovery prepared in
2009 suggests that, in absence of fiscal consolidation, increased transparency, removed
bottlenecks in non tradable sectors, stabilization mechanisms and increased provision of
agricultural public goods, economic growth could, after the initial boom, be lower over the long
run than without oil. In the event, poverty would suffer from lower economic growth and
increased regional disparities, in disfavor of the North. In the face of it, Ghana has made
significant progress in setting up the institutional and regulatory framework for oil and gas (see
Section 4B). It is also committed to promoting commercial agriculture, as well as to
operationalizing the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority through proper public
funding.
20.     The implementation of the Government’s economic stabilization and reform
program should minimize risks of external debt distress. A Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was conducted in May 20117, using new national accounts, thus
revised lower debt to GDP ratios and sooner prospects for IDA graduation than previously
assumed with higher GNI per capita. Accordingly, Ghana’s debt burden indicators have improved
since the June 2010 assessment, and the lower than anticipated level of non concessional
borrowing in 2010, see below, also contributed to it. Risk of external debt distress is assessed to
remain at a moderate level, provided that the programmed fiscal consolidation is achieved and
external public sector borrowing is restrained. At the same time, overall public sector debt is
projected to increase moderately in relation to GDP over the long term. If the planned fiscal
consolidation is achieved without a substantial further debt build-up (including through
contingent liabilities from SOEs debt, currently not included in public debt numbers) an improved
rating of low risk of debt distress could be considered in a future assessment.
21.     Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non concessional borrowing.
Following the issuance of US$750 million worth of Eurobonds in 2007 (to finance additional
electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed externally at non concessional terms
US$458 million equivalent in 2008, US$448 million equivalent in 2009, and US$215 million
equivalent in 2010 to finance projects for rural electrification, electricity transmission and
generation capacity, housing, health, security, transport, fire-fighting, sea cost protection, as well
as to cover an unfunded external SOE liability in 2009. In its third and fourth reviews of the
Extended Credit Facility (covering the period January 1- December 31, 2010), the IMF indicated
that the ceiling on non-concessional borrowing had been respected over the relevant period.
Accordingly, disincentives applied to the country since 2008 were discontinued, consistent with a
progressive path towards market financing, and Ghana will receive its full IDA allocation on
regular terms in FY12 (and part of its IDA allocation in the form of grants). If Ghana’s GNI per

capita (atlas method) stays over the IDA operational cutoff in 2011 and 2012, it will eventually
receive its allocation in blend terms from FY14.8 In its assessment of Ghana’s non concessional
borrowing in 2010,9 the World Bank also acknowledges progress made to (i) restore energy state-
owned utilities’ operational and financial sustainability to limit default risks on their non-
concessional debt (see Section 4B), (ii) develop a Medium Term Debt Management Strategy,10
and (iii) strengthen Ghana’s capacity to select and appraise public investment projects11.
22.     The Parliament approved in August 2011 a Master Facility Agreement to borrow
US$3.0 billion from the China Development Bank at non concessional terms. The MFA will
need to be signed by MOFEP to be considered under the Non Concessional Borrowing Policy.
Subsidiary loan agreements, for each of the investment projects12 foreseen to be financed under
the Agreement, will then need to be approved by Parliament and MOFEP before disbursements
can be effected. As part of its fifth ECF review, the IMF, in collaboration with the World Bank,
has been reviewing the Agreement, its fitness to the macroeconomic framework, as well as its
impact on debt sustainability. The review concluded overall that the preliminary selection of
projects to be financed under the Agreement was in line with GSGDA’s objectives, and justified
in particular by the very high returns expected from the gas project. In line with the joint DSA of
May 2011 (which included US$4.2 billion worth of non concessional borrowing to be disbursed
over the period 2011-16), the updated joint DSA also conservatively concluded that Ghana could
borrow US$3.0 billion at non concessional terms in the next 4 years (US$750 million each year)
without increasing risks of external debt distress.13 Moving forward, MOFEP committed to
review, with World Bank technical assistance, the institutional framework currently directing
public investment decision – from strategic guidance and formal appraisal, to project selection,
budgeting, implementation and evaluation – in order to maximize economic and social returns of
projects and their integration into medium term budget frameworks.
23.   Ghana’s macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of the
proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 and 2012 Budget and

   Starting in IDA16, IDA’s hardened term credits (for countries with a GNI per capita exceeding the operational
cutoff for three consecutive years) and blend countries will be harmonized into one instrument with a final maturity
of 25 years with a 5-year grace period and a 1.25 percent per annum interest rate.

10
    A new debt management strategy was adopted in 2010 and published by MOFEP, drawing on joint Bank-Fund
technical assistance. The strategy establishes clear objectives for debt management in terms of the cost and risk of the
debt portfolio (including contingent liabilities such as non guaranteed debt contracted by public entities), and
identifies potential funding sources. With the anticipated decline in potential for concessional borrowing, the strategy
recommends to fill the financing gap with semi-concessional and commercial debt, while extending the maturities of
domestic debt (to 10 years). To minimize the currency risk on debt portfolio, government intends to maintain a
balanced currency split even though most of the current debt, reserves and export receipts are US dollar denominated.
It is also planning to apply a second Debt Management Performance Assessment to monitor progress in institutional
strengthening and to further identify areas in need of further reform. In addition, it will publish quarterly debt
bulletins, focusing on debt sustainability issues.
11
    In 2010, the Government adopted the Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy, to be converted into Bill for
submission to Parliament. The policy defines guidelines, procedure and institutional responsibilities for the appraisal
and selection of public investment projects, be it financed directly through the budget, through concessional or non
concessional borrowing, or through PPP arrangements.
12
    Projects include the development of railways, gas infrastructure, and industrial zones in the Western region,
commercial agriculture in Accra plains, railways in the Eastern region, fishing infrastructure in coastal areas, urban
transport in Accra, and nation-wide SME incubation.

execution so far (as evidenced by the successful conclusion of the IMF ECF fifth review on
December 14, 2011, see Annex 6), the nature and pace of actions taken by the Government since
2009 to regain control of the fiscal situation on a sustainable basis and the complementary
financial assistance from Development Partners and the IMF should provide the conditions for the
proposed operation to meet its objectives, and justify the use of IDA resources.

        C.       POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

24.     Ghana recorded very significant poverty reduction between 1992 and 2006, though
almost entirely concentrated in the South. The estimated proportion of the poor in the total
population went down from 51.7 percent in 1992 to 28.5 percent in 2006.14 And this trend was
accompanied with a strong decline in the prevalence of malnutrition, which was halved between
1993 and 2008. But most of the poverty reduction occurred in the South, where large productivity
gains in the agricultural sector (cocoa in particular) and demographic changes freed human and
financial resources to be redeployed and invested in higher value-added sectors, the urban
informal sector in particular. The bulk of poverty has become concentrated in the three northern
regions which now comprise almost half of the poor (against a fourth of Ghana’s population) and
where no significant poverty reduction has been observed in the past, either through local

25.     Participatory and quantitative assessments describe a situation where the poor in
Northern Ghana are predominantly rainfall-dependent farmers. These farmers are highly
vulnerable to shocks given the limited diversification of their income sources. While the poor
have little education, increases in education in Northern Ghana do not seem to have provided

   Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line of
US$1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

greater livelihood opportunities. This is reflective of the absence of better off-farm opportunities
in these regions. To cope with the various shocks to which they are exposed (floods, droughts,
insects, diseases, conflicts – all of which are preventable with relevant infrastructure, public
services, insurance and conflict resolution mechanisms) the poor tend to mortgage their prospects
to eventually escape poverty by depleting their human and physical capital and adopting risky
behaviors, including child migration or illegal artisanal mining.

26.     Efforts to address the special needs of these lagging regions had been initiated in the
recent past, and there are ongoing efforts to amplify them in the context of an ambitious
Savannah Accelerated Development initiative. The initiative, supported by the establishment of
the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA), aims to increase agricultural
productivity, promote a more sustainable management of its natural resources and reduce the
exposure of the population to collective risks, such as natural disasters. The initiative will ensure
tight coordination and better targeting of public and private (e.g. NGOs) activities, in order to
achieve durable poverty alleviation. In this respect, effective decentralization of resource and
decision making is foreseen as an important means to address regional imbalances in service
delivery, via the strengthening of local capacity and vertical accountability mechanisms, see
Section 4B. Greater targeting efficiency (through geographical targeting and the adoption of a
common targeting mechanism in particular) and the reduction of unit costs of social programs is
also foreseen to be critical to scale up social protection in the North, see Section 4B.

27.     Since 2006, various factors could have impacted poverty positively or negatively.
Between 2006 and 2010, per capita real private consumption grew cumulatively by approximately
13 percent, which, if equally shared across households, should have generated significant poverty
reduction gains (assuming unchanged distribution, the headcount index would have approached
24.8 percent by end-2010). However, important uncertainties regarding the measurement of
private consumption and its distribution among households and regions, and the fact that some
recent shocks (e.g., climatic events, price variations) might have disproportionally affected the
poor could mean lower actual poverty reduction gains. At the same time, the rapid agricultural
output growth recorded in the North since 2006 could point in the other direction.16 A new Ghana
Living Standard Survey (GLSS6) is scheduled to be conducted in 2012, providing the necessary
data for a poverty update. Combined with revised national accounts for the period 2006-10, it
could also modify the understanding of the role played by economic growth in poverty reduction
in the last two decades. So far, the assessment was that Ghana’s economic growth had been very
much “pro-poor? between 1992 and 2006, at least from a cross-country perspective. Indeed,
Ghana stands as one of the countries that have experienced the largest growth contribution and the
lowest inequality contribution to poverty reduction.

28.     The high vulnerability of poor households to frequent shocks underline the
importance of protecting them through targeted measures, such as a further extension of the
cash transfer program (Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty, LEAP) to new beneficiaries.
The recent review of existing social protection mechanisms indeed suggests that LEAP offers the
greatest guarantee of reaching the poor as relatively well targeted,17 even if implementation costs


16
   Between 2007 and 2010, the share of maize production in the North increased from 11 to 19 percent of national
production, and the share of rice production increased from 49 to 67 percent of national production.
17
   See Republic of Ghana: Improving the Targeting of Social Programs, World Bank, June 2010, Washington D.C.
The report suggests that with 57 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line, LEAP has the highest targeting
efficiency among Ghana’s social programs and subsidies.

                                                    - 13 -
remain high and could be reduced as the program expands (and other programs adopt similar
targeting mechanisms, See Section 4B).

29.     The ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts also call for protection and improved
effectiveness and efficiency of pro-poor expenditures. In spite of containment in public
spending, pro-poor were protected in 2010 and 2011, see Section 4B, and it will be important to
continue protecting them in the future. But effectiveness and efficiency gains can be made in
numerous sectors as well. The forthcoming Public Expenditure Review underline in this respect
the criticality of containing general increases in personal emoluments to lower unit costs of
service delivery (in Health, Education and Agriculture networks in particular) while providing the
space for financing non-wage expenditure, and encourage effective deployment of staff and
supervisors to poor areas. It also underlines the criticality of PFM reforms, cash management in
particular, to accelerate releases to beneficiaries through local governments.

30.     In its effort to tackle poverty in Northern Ghana, the proposed operation is
complemented with many other World Bank activities. This includes ongoing agricultural
Development Policy Operations and a forthcoming commercial agriculture project, aimed notably
at encouraging agricultural productivity gains in the North; a social opportunity project aimed at
strengthening safety nets and employment opportunities in the North; a decentralization project
aimed at improving Northern municipalities service delivery through greater capacity and
accountability; a transport project developing feeder roads networks in the North to create some
economic density; an rural electrification project particularly focused on the North, including
inter-connection with Burkina Faso; and land administration and urban transport / water /
sanitation projects, to increase cities’ absorptive capacity of Northern economic migrants. As part
of its economic and social work, the World Bank is also exploring water management options for
flood prevention and the development of irrigation schemes in the North.

31.    The review of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) depicts
a picture of quick progress, but on sanitation and health. The income poverty, hunger,
primary completion, gender parity at school and access to water goals (MDG1a, MDG1b, MDG2,
MDG3 and MDG7a respectively) are on track to be met by 2015, if not already met (MDG7a).18


18
   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating them, the
World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To do so, it compares the
progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption that progress becomes
increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is equivalent to comparing the annual

                                                         - 14 -
At the same time, other important MDGs, such as sanitation (MDG7b), child (MDG4) and
maternal mortality (MDG5) are still off-track and require more effort, for their own sake and
likely large impact on other MDGs.19

32.     Health. In 2010, the holistic assessment of the health sector showed overall
satisfactory performance.20 Such a performance is also measured by the comparison of the last
two demographic and health surveys in 2003 and 2008. The progress achieved over this period is
impressive: under-5 mortality was reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, the proportion
of malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 to 14 percent, and the pregnancy-related
mortality rate dropped from 503 to 451 per 100,000 live births. Yet, slower progress in the
previous decade has made these two MDG off track. Health progress results to a large extent from
the creation and continued increase in coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme
(NHIS), reaching 16.9 million people by end 2010 (70 percent of the population). And while
about half of the registered population did not enjoy effective access to NHIS services (as lacking
valid cards), the number of outpatient visits under the NHIS rose from 2.4 million in 2007 to 18.7
million in 2010. Nonetheless, problems remain, such as inequity in access to NHIS (the poor
being less covered, in spite of well targeted exemptions for indigents), delayed budget releases,
and the questionable financial sustainability of the NHIS.21

33.      Education. In line with the Education Sector Development Strategy adopted in 2003,
progress in terms of access to primary education has been significant. Gross primary
enrollment rates went up from 86 to 95 percent between 2003/4 and 2009/10, while net primary
enrollment rates went up from 56 to 84 percent over the same period. Over the years, increased
efforts at building new schools in deprived districts, and increased attention to gender parity, have
allowed for an extension of progress in access in primary education by vulnerable populations.
The demand side was supported with the initiation of a school feeding program in poor regions,
abolition of school fees, and by the development of conditional transfers in the context of the
LEAP program. Moving forward, the Education Strategic Plan 2010-2020 is increasingly shifting
policy attention to quality. Indeed, Ghanaians students rank poorly in international mathematical
and science tests (TIMSS), and national tests conducted in 2009 suggest that only 36 and 14
percent of primary graduates are respectively proficient in English and in mathematics, even if
these ratios improved slightly since 2005. The poor deployment of trained teachers in deprived
areas contributes to these poor learning achievements and inequitable benefit incidence.22 This in
a context where 96 percent of the Government budget for education already goes to salaries,
limiting resource essential for the quality of instruction, such as teacher training, ICT, books,
materials and school infrastructure.

34.    Water and Sanitation. Demographic and Health surveys (DHS) regularly conducted
since 1990 report steady progress in access to safer water, in both rural and urban areas,
which sharply contrast with the slow progress registered in access to sanitation facilities
throughout Ghana. Using different definitions of access than that retained internationally, the
Ghana Community Water and Sanitation Agency presents a more balanced picture of progress

growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate required to reach the MDG in 2015 from the
situation in 1990.

between water and sanitation. It nonetheless remains that Ghana continue to face great challenges
in the sector overall, from insufficient domestic funding to inadequate institutional capacity for
effective sector coordination and management. In 2010, the Strategic Environmental Sanitation
Investment Plan was approved by Cabinet, the implementation of which is expected to address
coordination and funding issues.

                        D.           GHANA GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

35.     The Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA, 2010-13) follows
GPRS-I and GPRS-II. 23 The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy I (GPRS-I) for the period 2003-
05 was prepared as part of the HIPC initiative and aimed at improving macroeconomic stability
and basic service delivery. The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (GPRS-II), building on
earlier macroeconomic stabilization and human development achievements, shifted the focus to
accelerated growth through private sector development and infrastructure provision. With first oil
and the attainment of middle income status with upwards revision of the national accounts in
2010, the GSGDA lays the foundation for the rapid structural transformation of the economy,
premised on agricultural modernization and a sustainable exploitation of mineral resources.
Building on lessons learned from GPRS-I and GPRS-II, the GSGDA emphasizes the need for

23
   The GSGDA comprises three volumes: the policy framework, the costing framework, and the monitoring and
evaluation framework. The policy framework benefited from consultations in 2009-10 with Ministries, Departments
and Agencies (MDAs), private sector representatives, civil society organizations, chieftaincies, and was discussed
with Development Partners (DPs) at the Consultative Group Meeting held in September 2010. The “Coordinated
Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, 2010-16?, which forms the basis of the GSGDA, was
presented by the President of the Republic of Ghana to the Parliament on December 2010.

                                                          - 16 -
continued macroeconomic stability and greater public sector efficiency and executive
transparency and accountability to provide the setting for poverty reduction. It also underlines the
pivotal role of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) for effective implementation of the GSGDA.

36.     The GSGDA and the Aid Policy Paper for the period 2011-1524 reiterate the need for
continued official development assistance – and budget support in particular. Indeed,
financing needs to meet Ghana’s development aspirations cannot be entirely funded from
domestic resources combined with prudent external non concessional borrowing. And while the
availability of substantial oil revenue could eventually prompt DPs to reduce their ODA to Ghana,
it is the Government’s view that continued support would be needed in the first years of oil
production to limit the potential of the “oil curse? developing in Ghana, as well as providing
additionality to oil revenues. Indeed, risks of political capture, macroeconomic instability, lost
external competitiveness and increased regional inequalities stemming from oil are significant25,
and call for particular attention to public sector reform (single spine pay reform, decentralization,
capacity building, transparency and external accountability), the enforcement of multi-year
macroeconomic frameworks (public financial management, debt management strategy, medium
term expenditure frameworks, tax collection), macro-economic stabilization (utilities financial
recovery, oil stabilization funds, arrears liquidation, financial sector regulation), the investment
climate (urban development, land regulation, informal labor markets), and rural development
(commercial agriculture, connective infrastructure and social protection in the North, climate
change adaptation and mitigation). Against this background, continued ODA could be particularly
instrumental to secure stable funding, encourage the development of macroeconomic stabilization
mechanisms, continued progress in public financial management, transparency, executive
accountability, capacity building, investment effectiveness, and overall reform implementation. In
this context, general budget support would continue to be the preferred aid modality, within the
aligned and harmonized MDBS framework (see Box 1).

37.     The Joint Staff Assessment Note26 found the underlying sector development plans
compelling and well considered, but also stressed important risks to implementation, which
could reduce Ghana’s ability to meet the GSGDA objectives. These reflect limited monitoring
and evaluation capacity, insufficient reliance on spatial interventions, and a large resource gap,
which the Government estimated at US$12.5 billion. In these respects, staffs considered useful to
(i) limit the number of GSGDA indicators to monitor while improving fiscal reporting, (ii)
accelerate the use of geographically targeted interventions and the development of related
coordinating institutions, and (iii) strengthen the capacity of the MTEF to allocate limited public
resource to GSGDA priorities. Furthermore, efforts to accelerate disbursements on donor-funded
projects, encourage public-private partnerships, strengthen tax collection and the revenue base
and public finance management, while improving the effectiveness of public spending, will help
increase Ghana’s fiscal space.

         3. WORLD BANK GROUP’S SUPPORT TO THE GROWTH AND POVERTY
                            REDUCTION STRATEGY

                   A.      LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)

38.     The updated FY8-12 CAS progress report underlines the need and opportunity for
adjustments in the strategy to flexibly address challenges unforeseen in 2007. While the
overall objectives of reducing poverty and inequality set out under the CAS remain relevant, the
macroeconomic crisis of 2008, the discovery of oil and gas and the arrival of a new administration
in 2009 warranted adjustments to the strategy, as reflected in the CAS progress report presented
to the Board in Q3 FY10. Major adjustments include:

         Front loaded Development Policy Operations, to respond to macro-economic stabilization
          needs (EGPRC and PRSC7 at US$300 and US$200 million respectively), after which
          annual contributions will come back to US$100 million, from PRSG8 in FY12;

         Technical Assistance for capacity building in the emerging oil and gas sector;

         Scaling up investment lending and new or re-designed operations in the following
          domains, to reflect Ghana’s new priorities: electricity (expanded capacity and regional
          trade in power), public sector reform (decentralization), public financial management
          (including integrated information systems), social protection (LEAP, public works)
          commercial agriculture, urban water and sanitation, and statistical development for results
          based policy formulation; 27

         Extension of the current CAS to FY12 (that is, until June 2012), in order to ensure smooth
          transition from IDA15 to IDA16 during the remaining period of the current
          administration. 28

39.    The proposed PRSG8 is a central instrument of the adjusted CAS, given its size and
focus. Under IDA-16, Ghana’s annual allocation will amount to about US$285 million, making
the PRSG8 central to the overall portfolio. The PRSG8 also encourages policy reform in domains
where the Bank is financially supporting the GSGDA implementation, namely: public financial
management, energy (electricity, oil and gas), public sector reform, and social protection.

40.    The proposed operation is on grant terms. Unlike previous Development Policy
Operations (PRSCs, EGPRC), the PRSG8 is on grant terms, benefiting from the fact that Ghana
did not breach in 2010 the World Bank Non Concessional Borrowing Policy.29 As such, 45
percent of IDA allocation in FY12 will be on grant terms, and the Government decided to use this
mode of financing for the proposed operation.

41.    The proposed operation is also well aligned to the World Bank Strategy for Africa.
Through its focus on developing a sound institutional and regulatory framework for oil and gas,
the programmatic operation aims to encourage the sustainable development of the sector

agriculture) to foster job creation and economic diversification. Gas-related activities are foreseen
as important sources of job creation and economic diversification. The reliable and growing
provision of electricity is also expected to facilitate the emergence of new economic activities.
The programmatic operation also aims to strengthen resilience to shocks, by minimizing them
(restored fiscal and financial stability, stabilization funds), and by strengthening social protection
(common targeting mechanism). Finally, efforts to build public sector capacity (public financial
management, decentralization, subvented agencies) and improve governance, both from demand
(transparency) and supply side (petroleum revenue management) are supported by the
programmatic operation, see Section 4B. The deployment and consolidation of partnerships with
the Government (see Sections 2D and 3E), the Development Partners (see Section 3C) and the
CSOs and think tanks (both in the identification of issues and prior actions through ex-ante
consultations) and in the review of progress (through active participation in the MDBS annual
review), see Section 5A, is also strongly supported by the programmatic operation.

      B.       RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS

42.     PRSC1-6 (2003-2008) accompanied significant achievements in terms of governance,
growth, public service delivery and poverty reduction. While the issue of attribution of
specific outcome to these operations is complicated, the implementation of the latter nevertheless
coincides with a period of rapid developmental progress. The Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) index went from 3.4 to 4.0 between 2001 and 2007. Poverty reduction was
also very rapid during the same period. Annual GDP growth was 1.6 percentage points higher on
average over the PRSC period than during the previous six years (1996-2001). The proportion of
people living with less than US$1.25 a day declined from 39 percent in 1999 to 29 percent in
2006.

43.     Overall, PRSCs 1-3 were internally rated satisfactory, while PRSCs 4-6 were rated
moderately satisfactory.30 The progressive drop in rating resulted mostly from widening budget
deviations and growing fiscal deficits, declining external accountability, and mounting structural
problems in energy and the public sector. Besides, increasing coordination costs of operating the
Multi Donor Budget Support Group within which PRSCs were successively developed made the
structure slow in responding to unfolding developments and emerging strategic priorities, at a
time where electoral considerations and greater access to financial markets were also weakening
mutual accountability mechanisms.

44.     The sudden deterioration of the macro-economic performance in 2008 prompted the
Bank to support Government’s focused efforts to bring their fiscal stance on a sound and
sustainable track through the stand-alone Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction
Credit (EGPRC) in 2009. Efforts supported by the EGPRC concentrated on measures to
improve public financial management, raise fiscal transparency, restore financial viability in the
electricity sector, prepare for oil through the adoption of regulatory and fiscal frameworks, regain
control on public sector labor force and rationalize Subvented Agencies, and expand and improve
social protection. As such, it contributed to the significant stabilization gains recorded in 2009,
paving the way for further achievements in 2010 and beyond (see Section 2A). The EGPRC was
internally rated31 as moderately satisfactory, on the ground that the quality at entry was impaired

by the insufficient time devoted to develop a solid M&E framework and harmonize with DPs,
reflective of the need to proceed on a fast track mode. All other aspects were rated as satisfactory.
        C.       COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS’ PROGRAMS

45.     The proposed operation is fully aligned to the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)
process. The World Bank was a founding member of the MDBS initiative and has been the
permanent co-chair of the group since its inception in 2003. The MDBS process is a central
instrument of aid harmonization in Ghana. It includes the identification with the Government of a
selective joint matrix of policy actions to be supported by Development Partners (DPs), aligning
their monitoring and evaluation frameworks through a common rolling 3-year Progress
Assessment Framework (PAF). PRSG8 prior actions were identified during the MDBS annual
review of 2010 and progress against them assessed during the MDBS annual review of 2011.
46.     As the current programmatic series is closing, and in absence of a successor Country
Assistance Strategy, the World Bank cannot at this stage commit to financially support the
MDBS PAF 2011-13. Indeed, the closing of the series (PRSC7 and PRSG8) will require an
Implementation, Completion Results (ICR) report for a new series to be launched, and the
decision to continue provide general budget support will be made within the context of the new
Country Assistance Strategy, starting in FY13. The new CAS will provide the opportunity to
define the nature of World Bank engagement, accounting for new realities in Ghana, and
transition to middle income status in particular. Nonetheless, as permanent co-chair, the World
Bank has been staying engaged with authorities and DPs in the MDBS framework, notably
contributing to the design of the PAF 2011-13, and will continue to actively participate to MDBS
annual reviews. Besides, through its analytical work, participation to sector working groups, and
investment projects and sector budget supports, the World Bank will continue to pursue a deep
policy dialogue with the Government and citizens of Ghana, to maintain the momentum created
by recent Development Policy Operations.
47.     The PRSG8 is being prepared in close coordination with the IMF. The IMF and World
Bank teams collaborated closely since the design and launch of the PRGF (now ECF) and
EGPRC in early 2009, since followed by the PRSC7 and the proposed operation. Following the
agreed institutional division of labor between the Bank and the IMF (as reflected in successive
annual Ghana-Joint World Bank-IMF Work Program agreed since 2009), there is a common
understanding of the macro and debt sustainability situation. The IMF and World Bank teams are
also closely collaborating on issues of public financial management with a clear division of labor
on the policy actions identified. The division of labor is also reflected in the complementarity
between prior actions in the proposed programmatic operation with performance criteria and
structural benchmarks in the ECF.32



32
   Besides quantitative performance criteria related to the phased reduction of the fiscal deficit and the stock of
domestic arrears, the ECF include structural benchmarks related to (i) the reporting of arrears and the adoption of an
arrears liquidation strategy, (ii) the conduction of audits in remaining problem banks, the adoption of a strategy to
address them, and submission to Parliament of amendments to Banking Laws to close regulatory gaps, including with
respect to bank resolution options, and (iii) the management of petroleum product prices to avoid fiscal subsidies,
which all complement and strengthen efforts supported by PRSG8. Such structural benchmarks are expected to be
implemented in FY12. Structural benchmarks (implemented in FY11) complementing PRSC7 included (i) the
migration of non security SA payroll to the IPPD-2, (ii) the submission to cabinet of a list of SA to be
commercialized or liquidated, (iii) the submission to Parliament of the oil revenue management bill, and (iv) the
development of a strategy for restoring TOR financial and commercial viability.

                                                     - 20 -
                    D.       COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

48.     The proposed Development Policy Operation is part of a program of support to
Ghana that focuses on public financial management, public sector reform, energy, social
protection and agriculture. Following the Board approval in FY10 of investment lending
projects for public financial management (US$28 million), electricity distribution (US$70
million), and social protection (US$89 million), the Board approved in FY11 investment lending
projects for land administration (US$50 million), local government capacity (US$175 million), oil
and gas capacity (US$38 million), and skills development (US$70 million). It also approved the
PRSC7 (US$215 million) and third agriculture development policy operation (US$57 million).
The PRSG8 supports the agenda of sector development policy operations by focusing on ensuring
an adequate fiscal stance and the strengthening of cross-cutting public financial management
issues. It complements the public financial management, oil and gas, electricity, social protection
and public sector reform investment operations and technical assistance by encouraging the
preparation and implementation of key policy actions in the domains above mentioned.
49.     The proposed operation is also complemented by World Bank activities to support
demand for good governance. Such support has been taking various forms under PRSC7 and
PRSG8, including (i) to Ghana think tanks to independently assess Ghana’s macroeconomic
policy in MDBS annual reviews; (ii) to the Ghana Oil and Gas Platform to influence transparency
and accountability in the oil and gas sector, evidenced in Ghana's widely praised Petroleum
Revenue Management Act 815 and subsequent regulations; (iii) to the Ghana Aid Effectiveness
Forum, through budget literacy and capacity building to promote independent budget monitoring
and transparency; and (iv) to the four Parliamentary political parties to identify areas of
development policy collaboration and related institutional set ups.
                                         E.      LESSONS LEARNED

50.     The criticality of Ghana’s ownership through the empowerment of Sector Working
Groups is a lesson to retain when designing general development policy operations, as well
as the need to focus on cross-cutting issues. Discussions held between the Government and DPs
in a retreat in October 2009 underlined (i) the critical role of Sector Working Groups in the
identification of policy reforms and regular monitoring of their implementation and (ii) the need
for the Government to be represented at the policy making level in these Sector Working Groups
for effective ownership. Discussions also underlined the need for the MDBS and general
Development Policy Operations to concentrate their attention and efforts to cross-cutting issues
and complementarity across sector policies, leaving sector-specific policy dialogue to Sector
Working Groups and sectoral Development Policy Operations. These recommendations were
reflected in (i) the choice of prior actions in the proposed operation, mostly focused on policy
domains directly affecting overall budget execution, (ii) the content of discussions held at the
MDBS annual reviews in May 2010 and May 2011, which focused on cross-cutting issues33 and
the review of underlying principles for budget support, and (iii) the reliance on SWG to assess
progress and propose policy reforms in their respective sectors.

51.    Another lesson to be learned from the EGPRC and other DPO is the need to address
implementation risks which are high when intergovernmental coordination is required.
Increasingly, the nature of reforms Ghana is embarking on requires coordination across various

33
  Cross cutting issues addressed during the reviews included budget credibility, decentralization, climate change,
petroleum revenue management, public sector capacity, and equity.

                                                   - 21 -
parts of the Government (e.g. oil and gas, public sector reform, social protection). MDBS
Development Partners have come to the view that, while MOFEP should keep its coordinating
and counterpart role, the MDBS Progress Assessment Framework (from which PRSG8 prior
action are extracted) should be formally endorsed by Ministers to encourage better
intergovernmental coordination. This view is also shared by MOFEP.

                               F.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

52.       The design of the proposed operation draws on several economic and social analyses:

         The World Bank Country Economic Memorandum completed in 2007, and the Africa
          Infrastructure Country Diagnosis completed in 2010 which both underline the importance
          of closing infrastructure gaps (in electricity notably) for growth and poverty reduction
          through reduced inefficiencies (utilities pricing in particular);

         External Reviews of Public Financial Management (ERPFM) of 2007 and 2010, the
          Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report of 2010, and the IMF
          FAD report on the PFM framework of 2010, which identify key reform areas (integrated
          financial information systems, cash management, commitment controls, and payroll
          management notably) to sustain progress in this domain;

         The World Bank Poverty Report (2011), the World Bank review of Targeting Mechanisms
          in Social Programs (2010), and the World Bank Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
          (2010) on electricity tariff increases which offer recommendations to improve the social
          protection architecture while removing inefficient subsidies;

         The Joint Review of Public Expenditure and Financial Management (2011) which
          highlights progress and challenges related to public financial management, the public
          wage bill, subvented agencies, and fiscal decentralization;

         Several World Bank Global Expert Teams missions reports in 2009 and 2010 on public
          sector reform which lay out options to improve over the medium term service delivery at a
          sustainable cost through civil service reform and decentralization;

         The World Bank report on the economy-wide impact of oil discovery prepared in 2009
          which emphasizes the attention to be given to fiscal stabilization, transparency and
          external accountability for a developmental use of oil revenue;

         The MDBS annual review of the Performance Assessment Framework 2010-12 of May
          2011, which discusses challenges and progress in upholding underlying principles for
          continued budget support (see Annex 5) and in meeting targets at the sectoral level;

         Implementation, Completion and Results Reports of PRSC1-3 (2007) PRSC4-6 (2010),
          and EGPRC (2011) which identify challenges associated with the conduction of
          Development Policy Operations in Ghana;

         And IMF and World Bank continued economic monitoring and analysis (Article IV
          reports 2009 and 2011, ECF first to fifth reviews, Debt Sustainability Analyses 2010 and
          2011, Non Concessional Borrowing Policy papers 2010 and 2011, Financial Sector
          Assessment Programs 2010) which assess the sustainability of the fiscal stance and the
          broader macro-economic framework.

       4. THE PROPOSED EIGHTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT

                             A.      RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

53.     The proposed Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG8) aims to support
the authorities’ four-pronged efforts to restore budgetary discipline and financial stability and
(ii) foster public sector reform and strengthen sustainability in the energy sector, while (iii)
protecting the poor and (iv) developing the oil and gas institutional framework. Government’s
efforts supported by the PRSG8 concentrate on measures to:

      Prevent the accumulation of new public expenditure arrears and adopt a second financial
       sector development strategy;

      Adopt an action plan for the continued subvention, rationalization, divestiture or
       commercialization of subvented agencies, and adopt the decentralization policy;

      Establish and implement an electricity automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, and adopt
       an action plan for the restoration of the Tema Oil Refinery financial sustainability;

      Test and validate the common targeting mechanism for major social protection programs;

      Establish a petroleum regulatory authority.

54.    The proposed measures build on Government achievements supported by the PRSC7
in the same policy domains. Government’s efforts supported by the PRSC7 concentrated on
measures to:

      Establish basic processes for effective cash management of the Government Consolidated
       Fund and compiling claims & outstanding payments, and prepare the chart of accounts for
       budgeting, accounting and reporting for all MDAs;

      Begin implementing recommendations of the electricity financial recovery plan, and
       complete a definitive roll-out of Subvented Agencies in preparation for their continued
       subvention, rationalization, divestiture or commercialization;

      Reach an agreement between relevant Ministries (Ministries of Employment & Social
       Welfare, Education, Health and Local Government & Rural Development) on institutional
       responsibilities, budget, detailed objectives, action plan & timeline for the adoption & use
       of a common targeting mechanism for major social protection programs;

      Adopt the oil and gas revenue management bill after consultations with stakeholders, and
       include the oil and gas sectors into a revised EITI institutional framework.

                  B.      DESIGN AND FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION

55.     Policy actions supported by the proposed operation are part of a larger Government
program to consolidate macroeconomic stabilization gains through structural reforms,
create jobs and reduce poverty, while preparing for the oil era. The Government program is
described in the following paragraphs and reflected in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex
2), and the MDBS rolling three-year PAF (Annex 4). Table 6 details the PRSG8 prior actions and
status. The rationale for their selection is discussed below, namely their importance to the

                                            - 23 -
program and expressed Government commitment and feasibility. All prior actions for PRSG8 are
fully aligned with the MDBS PAF.

Restoring Budgetary Discipline and Financial Stability
56.     The Government is committed to restore budgetary discipline by improving public
financial management and promoting social accountability and transparency. Restoring
budgetary discipline by re-establishing control over expenditures, generating more revenue and
efficiency gains, better budget planning, and providing an enabling environment for transparency
and accountability are key priorities for the Government in the present context, as emphasized in
the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Budget Laws. In so doing, the Government is also paving the way for a
more transparent and developmental use of oil and gas revenue.

57.     Public Financial Management. Progress was made in PFM reforms in the recent
years. As reported in the ERPFM and PEFA reports of 2010, Ghana continues to gear itself to
building a strong foundation towards achieving aggregate fiscal discipline, based on positive
developments in the following areas: (a) prevalent low levels of unreported extra-budgetary
expenditures; (b) good and timely public access to key fiscal information; (c) adherence to a fixed
and coherent budget calendar;34 (d) high average debt collection ratios for tax arrears and regular
and timely revenue transfers to the Consolidated Fund; (e) comprehensive recording and
reconciliation of debt service and on the debt portfolio; (f) predictable budget support
disbursements; (g) timely in-year budget implementation reports and annual financial reports on
the Consolidated Fund; and (h) improved effectiveness and timely external audit scrutiny. Other
salient improvements registered include broadened budget coverage and widened information on
internally generated funds and external grants, including HIPC and MDRI grants, and submission
by the Auditor General, of external audit reports to Parliament within 3 months of receipt of the
draft accounts from the Controller & Accountant General’s Department (CAGD), leading to more
proactive and transparent oversight of public finances by the Parliamentary Public Accounts
Committee. There was also progress in implementing the public procurement law, with increased
coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the tender review boards and, under the
auspices of the new internal audit agency law, the number of government ministries, departments
and agencies that submitted internal audit reports rose.
58.     But the scale of improvement in budget execution and control was not commensurate
with the amount invested in improving processes and systems. The fiduciary control
environment, according to the latest assessments, suffers from failures to (a) comprehensively
apply the guiding principles of a well structured consolidated cash management system, in a
Treasury Single Account mode, for all public expenditures supported under the budget, (b) fully
implement commitment accounting and controls and hence document, report on, and minimize
the potentials for, project arrears, (c) provide a consolidated fiscal picture in respect of revenues
and expenditures against the five separate and distinct funds of the Government; (d) manage the
inherent weaknesses in the management and control of payroll; (e) achieve meaningful results in
the policy towards rationalizing the proliferation of bank deposits held by MDAs outside the
control of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning, and the Bank of Ghana; and (f) adopt
and implement a Government Finance Statistics (GFS) functional chart of classification for
budgeting, accounting and fiscal reporting, that is uniform across all government formations.

34
   Ghana’s Budget Statement and Economic Policy is traditionally presented to Parliament in the second half of
November, and made available publically at the same time, with detailed tables, on internet (MOFEP website) and in
print. Since 2006, budgets were presented, approved and published in a timely manner.

                                                   - 24 -
Finally, progress in building internal audit capacity in MDAs has been mixed, with challenges
remaining in terms of focus on systemic issues rather than transactional.
59.     The implementation of the Public Accounts Committee recommendations remains
insufficient. Ghana Auditor-General’s report on 2009 demonstrated the persistence of control
weaknesses set out in earlier reports. In response, specific measures have been put in place by
MOFEP, CAGD, AG and Internal Audit to help ensure remedies are executed in 2011. DPs will
continue to monitor the audit process at all levels and will pay specific attention to the efforts of
Audit Recommendation Implementation Committees (ARICs), the imposition of sanctions and
responses to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) recommendations and in particular, the
follow up.
60.     Weaknesses in fiscal revenue policy and administration remain, even though the
Government has started to address them. The Government’s drive to implement the strategic
plan aimed at strengthening revenue collection and transparency in revenue administration will,
when judiciously pursued, enhance the efficiency, comprehensiveness, and transparency of
revenue administration in the near term. The challenge does remain, however, to implement an
effective and efficient tax administration under existing and explicit government policies as
measured by the frequency of complete accounts reconciliation between tax assessments,
collections, arrears records and receipts by the Treasury. The integration of the revenue agencies
under an umbrella entity – the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) – coupled with the Government
strategy to strengthen the LTU and bifurcate the allocation of taxpayers amongst large, medium,
and small tax offices, is one key step within the policy framework aimed at improving revenue
administration. In this respect, the Government adopted the GRA institutional and organizational
structure evaluation report and developed and adopted selection criteria for segmentation and
allocation of taxpayers to large, medium and small taxpayers offices. Other steps include the
setting up of the Transit Monitoring Unit by the Custom Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) to
prevent the diversion of transit goods back into the country; the improved revenue administration
within IRS including the introduction of computerized systems and expanding the special tax
audit of companies to cover some medium and small scale businesses in the informal sector; and
the continuing registration of retailers and intensified public education on the VAT Flat Rate
Scheme in VATS.
61.     To improve its capacity for budget monitoring and control, the Government has
taken concrete steps to commence the implementation of the Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) over the period 2010-14. To this end, the
Government had, in 2009, approved a PFM Improvement Charter – called the GIFMIS Charter –
that calls for the reinvigoration of a country-wide budget management system that is premised on
(a) the need to capture all public finances at the center and across all local governments; (b) a
single, unified chart of accounts and budget classification (for budgeting, accounting, and
reporting) that is compliant with IMF GFSM2001, see below; (c) developing and implementing
re-engineered business processes that are best practice; (d) integration of applications, including
personnel management and payroll database, on a single IT-based platform; (e) accommodating
the applicable principles and practices of robust commitment accounting; and (f) the need to
consolidate the reporting of all government finances. The Government intends to achieve these set
of goals and thus create the environment most conducive to improved accountability and
transparency, and also set the base for use of country PFM systems for all donor-funded
operations. This program of reform is supported by development partners in the overall sum of
US$60.3 million. It is conceived that this GIFMIS project will become the platform and key
thrust for more holistic PFM reforms across government. Meanwhile, the project has made


                                             - 25 -
progress in implementing, as a first step, the ‘General Ledger’ and ‘Procure to Pay’ modules of
the IFMIS application (Oracle Financials), and has included the full transition to GFS-compliant
chart of accounts/budget classification (CoA) in its Budget Call Circular (BCC) for preparation of
2012 budget for all MDAs and MMDAs. It is also revealing that the execution of the budget for
2012 and beyond will be conducted on the new CoA and commitment control will be a key
element of the execution process.
62.     The Treasury Single Account (TSA) has been established at the Bank of Ghana. The
goals of the reform are to enhance control by ensuring that all MDAs’ cash balances are known at
all times, as well as to save on short term financial charges by managing liquidity better. By doing
so, budget deviations are expected to be reduced, through improved in-time monitoring of the
Government’s cash balance. This will allow for improved predictability of resource flows to
service delivery agencies and support better commitment management and control. The effective
linkage of MDAs bank accounts to the TSA and the facilitation training of public servants have
commenced in 2010 and is ongoing. Although there exists a letter of agreement signed between
the Governor of the Bank of Ghana and the Minister of Finance on the strategy to be adopted and
the implementation plan to enable total coverage of all public finances under a TSA framework
by 2011, progress has remained slow and behind schedule. Currently, only MDA accounts linked
to the consolidated fund within the main and subsidiary branches of the Bank of Ghana form part
of the TSA; accounts held in commercial banks remain outside the framework for TSA in spite of
the government’s closure of about 1,500 such accounts during the past year in pursuance to
achieving objectives under the strategy.
63.     Nevertheless, the Government has established a basic operational process of an
efficient cash management system for the consolidated fund. During 2012 when the transition
to the GIFMIS would have been further realized, the full implementation of the monthly cash
management system could begin - all anchored on Treasury Single Account mechanism – to: (a)
enhance the predictability of expenditure commitments across MDAs; (b) assist to more reliably
account for, and reduce the potential for building up a, stock of expenditure arrears; (c) reduce
Government financial charges and short term borrowing costs (Government overdraft at BoG
notably, see the results framework in Annex 3) through improved cash management practices;
and (d) instill enhanced fiscal discipline through maintenance of hard budget constraints within
approved appropriations. Moving forward, the Government intends to ensure that the stabilized
cash management system provides weekly cash statements aligned with the TSA account.
64.     The Government has prepared and approved a harmonized chart of accounts for
budgeting, accounting and reporting for all its ministries, departments and agencies. The
adoption of the single, harmonized chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting and reporting will
(i) ensure that the reporting of the budget implementation is consistent with the budget itself; (ii)
ensure the comprehensiveness of reporting on the Government fiscal position; (iii) allow for
aggregation and disaggregation of expenditures in the budget across the whole of government;
and (iv) adopt the functional and economic classifications needed for proper expenditure review.
As such, it represents a critical building block to the effective development of GIFMIS, as well as
an indispensible input for information-based policy making, and the Government intends to start
producing and publishing Budget and monthly statements of the public accounts based on the
harmonized Chart of Account during the last quarter of 2011. The adoption of the harmonized
charts of account is also important to support the unimpeded development of program-based
budgeting planned currently under pilot. The Budget Call Circular (BCC) issued for preparation
of the 2012 budget already includes the new harmonized GFS-compliant chart of accounts/budget
classification for all MDAs and MMDAs.


                                             - 26 -
65.     The Government has established a basic process of compiling claims and outstanding
payment system, a process that was missing until recently. By doing so, MOFEP is now able to
make high-level checks on the consistency of MDAs commitments with their cash plans, and thus
contain the potential for projects arrears accumulation. Towards this objective, the Government
has also been developing a contract database to allow for a ready flow of information relating to
expenditure commitment and arising obligations in order to reduce the potentials for
accumulation of project arrears. Last but not least, the Government, through the MOFEP, has
reinstated and enforced in November 2010, basic commitment controls for all MDAs (PRSG8
prior action), in order to significantly contain the accumulation of new project arrears.35 Such
commitment controls had been relaxed in the midst of the energy and flood crises of 2007 and
2008 to accelerate MDAs (energy, and roads & highways in particular) investment response to
urgent needs. Combined with improved cash management and the conversion of existing arrears
into formal debt instruments, the monitoring and enforcement of controls on commitments is
expected to reduce the stock of public arrears (excluding wage arrears) over time, see the results
framework in Annex 3, and Table 1 for recent performance. It is noted, however, that even with
systems-based controls through the GIFMIS, no amount of ex-ante financial controls can cater to
avoidance of unauthorized expenditure commitments unless the practice of fiscal discipline
transcends to spending units through concerted efforts to abide by the dictates of the Financial
Regulations. Limiting MDA expenditure commitments to funds released against budgeted
appropriations can be the surest way of ensuring the control of expenditure arrears.
66.     Further progress in reducing the stock of Government arrears will be an important
factor in improving the overall stability of Ghana’s financial sector. While some progress has
been made (including the clearance of the Tema Oil Refinery’s debts to Ghana Commercial
Bank), further reductions are a high priority as arrears are a key contributing factor underlying the
high level of non-performing loans in the system, and the consequent fragility of a number of
banks. The continued involvement of the Government as both an owner and a regulator of the
banking system is also a factor, with the performance of state-owned banks being particularly
poor.
67.      Continued progress is also needed to strengthen the regulatory and supervision
regime for the financial sector, given the significant structural changes the sector has
undergone in the recent years. Qualitative issues such as the approach to risk management,
accounting standards, and general corporate governance all require attention, as does
strengthening the underlying system for asset recovery and insolvency. The primary vehicle for
achieving this, as well as for the broader development of Ghana’s financial sector, will be the
second Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSP II), which has been developed by the Ministry of
Finance & Economic Planning and submitted to Cabinet for decision (PRSG8 prior action). The
FINSSP II draws from lessons-learned from the previous plan, as well as the conclusions of the
recent joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program of 2011. While the vision and key
objectives for FINSSP II are consistent with its predecessor, there is a significantly stronger
emphasis on consolidating the gains of previous reform actions, strengthening Ghana’s regulatory
institutions, and building confidence in the system. Along with measures envisaged to reduce
arrears stock and flows, the implementation of the FINSSP II is expected to reduce the proportion
of NPL (through improved risk management), see the results framework in Annex 3.

35
   While the re-instatement of commitment controls is a necessary condition to avoid project arrears accumulation, it
is not, strictly speaking, a sufficient condition. Thus, arrears can technically be accumulated at the juncture of two
fiscal years, as financial obligations cannot all be liquidated in the fiscal year during which services and goods are
delivered. Nonetheless, up to September 2011, no new projects arrears had been accumulated (see Table 1).

                                                     - 27 -
Fostering Public Sector Reform and Strengthening Sustainability in the Energy Sector
68.     The main structural weaknesses in the budget, namely public sector and energy,
have been areas where reforms have been largely unsuccessful in the past. The very fast
increase in the payroll bill between 2004 and 2008 was the result of a steady increase in health
and educational services offered to the population, coupled with a large rise of public sector
wages, in subvented agencies in particular. The very large subsidies paid to the energy sector until
2008 were the result of a combination of large investments in the sector, the sharp rise of oil
prices in 2007-08, delayed delivery of gas from Nigeria, commercial losses by the utility
companies and inadequate cost recovery due to infrequent tariff adjustments at a time of high
inflation and currency depreciation. In both cases, reforms have become crucial to restore
macroeconomic balances and improve value for money and efficiency. Sustainable reforms in
both sectors require deliberate action over a period of several years, based on solid analysis and
broad consultation with stakeholders.

69.     Public Sector Reform. The Government, through its Public Sector Reform Secretariat
(PSRS) under the Office of the President, adopted in 2010 a new results-based approach to public
sector reform in Ghana and has set up a team at the Presidency to provide technical assistance and
accountability with line ministries.

70.     Pay policy development and management remains weak in Government. The
management and implementation of public sector pay policy in Ghana has resulted in significant
inequities and an unsustainable wage bill. The main challenges are: lack of clarity in the division
of responsibilities between the multiplicity of policy and financial control agencies; limited
capacity for the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC) to undertake its mandates; and
weaknesses in the macro-planning and budget system which fail to ensure that changes to the
remuneration regime are affordable and sustainable, whether incremental or through major pay
reforms.

71.     A new Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) was developed to address inequities in
the public sector. The objective of the proposed Single Spine Salary Structure is to address
disparities, distortions and restore equity in the pay structure by placing all public sector
employees on a vertical structure and ensuring that jobs within the same job value range are paid
within the same pay range. The Government hopes that it will be able to manage its wage bill
more efficiently and with more certainty and minimize industrial relations tensions with the
introduction of this new pay structure. The Government also intends to use this process to review
job description, improve salary administration and develop an efficient performance management
system. Performance contacts were signed in this regard with senior managers in MDAs, to be
followed with middle-level managers.

72.     The Government has started implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure. A
road map for the implementation of the SSSS was developed in a tripartite workshop in May
2009. Implementation of activities of the road map is on course. Cabinet approved the SSSS in
November 2009 and a White Paper was produced. It underlines the importance of ensuring that
the cost of the SSSS does not disrupt macroeconomic stability. Thus, the fiscal cost will be
phased out in a “pyramid manner, such that as the outer years of implementation are approached,
more resources will be made available to public workers until the pay policy is fully implemented
in the fifth year? (i.e., by 2014). Implementation of the SSSS has started in July 2010 through an




                                             - 28 -
incremental approach.36 By September 2011, about 69 percent (44 institutions) of the 520,000
public sector employees had been migrated on to the SSSS, and the Government was planning to
have migrated the remainder by end-2011. However, the expected decompression of wages under
the SSSS (through increased relativities), was postponed to the final years of implementation.

73.     Oversight and management of Subvented Agencies (SAs) in Ghana remains a
challenge and there is a need for clarifying their mandates and ensuring better control over
their payroll. In 2008, the 132 Subvented Agencies were representing 19 percent of the overall
public sector labor force and 35 percent of the Government total wage bill (salaries and
allowances). SAs were also receiving 82 percent of total allowances paid to public sector
employees. The SAs are financed through block grants from the Ministry of Finance & Economic
Planning. This grant is meant to cover their salaries, allowances and expenditures. However, since
few SAs are integrated into the integrated payroll system, there is no way to control headcount or
expenditures, and this resulted in the past in the very rapid increase in SA wage bill, through
increases in allowances in particular. The Government initiated a process to integrate the payroll
of SAs into the integrated payroll system that is managed by the Controller & Accountant
General’s Department (IPPD-2).37 This will strengthen the control that the Controller &
Accountant General has over the payroll and reduce the uncertainty in the management of the
payroll.

74.     On the way to improve the performance of public assets and institutions and reduce
duplication of functions, the Government reviewed the mandates and classified Subvented
Agencies according to their relevance with respect to the Government Shared Growth
Development Agenda. This review formed the basis for the Government, through the Ministry of
Finance & Economic Planning and the Public Sector Reform Secretariat, to develop and submit to
Cabinet for decision an action plan on Subvented Agency reform (PRSG8 prior action). This prior
action is closely linked to the migration of SAs onto the integrated payroll system managed by the
CAGD based on a common objective of eliminating waste and improving the efficiency in the use
of public resources. Aspects of the action plan are to be factored into the 2012 national budget, for
implementation starting the same year. The plan foresees a two-stage approach to subvented
agencies reform. During the first stage, 15 SAs will be put on performance contracts for a period
of three years. The second stage will gradually extend the reform to all SAs through performance
contracts or through memorandum of understanding for smaller agencies. Annual evaluations of
the performance of agencies will be conducted and corrective measures adopted when necessary.
Meanwhile, the Government has completed 4 pilot processes of voluntary redundancy in the
Ghana Standards Board, the Ghana National Procurement Agency, the Ghana International Trade
Fair Authority and the Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service. The
management of these pilots is providing useful lessons to guide future voluntary severance
packages.

75.    The Government has reviewed its approach to decentralization, through an extensive
consultation process. Decentralization, in Ghana is a constitutional entrenched provision and is
defined as devolution of considerable responsibilities to local government for ensuring a fair

36
   Although public sector employees will be progressively migrated to the SSSS progressively in the next years, it is
the understanding of the FWSC that the SSSS is effective for all public sector employees since January 1, 2010.
Hence, retroactive payments shall be honored for those transferred to the SPSS after this date.
37
   Out of the 196 SA, 117 had been migrated to the IPPD-2 by March 2010. However, the major ones in terms of
number of employees, such as and tertiary institutions (universities, polytechnics) were yet to be migrated to IPPD-2.
The migration of security agencies, such as Ghana Armed Forces and Ghana Police Service was suspended.

                                                     - 29 -
distribution of resources, as well as to enhance the quality of public service delivery. This is
believed to be a key policy instrument to reduce regional inequalities and poverty overall in
Ghana. The Government is committed to the decentralization agenda. It has concluded a nation-
wide consultation process under the direction of the Minister of Local Government & Rural
Development to collate views from stakeholders in all regional capitals. In addition, consultations
have been held with parliamentary committees on Local Government and Subsidiary Legislation,
think tanks, civil society groups and traditional authorities. The consultations were concluded
with a national level forum in February 2010.

76.     Following the nationwide consultation process, the Government, through the
Ministries of Local Governments & Rural Development, and Finance & Economic
Planning, finalized the Comprehensive Decentralization Policy and submitted the Policy and
Action Plan to Cabinet for decision (PRSG8 prior action). The plan details a series of activities
to be undertaken over four years to implement the policy framework. High on the agenda is the
devolution of basic service functions to local governments (Metropolitan and Municipal District
Assemblies, MMDAs) and the operationalization of the Local Government Service. It is
anticipated that about 30,000 civil servants would be moved from the civil service to the local
government service. A robust human resource management system and database are therefore
needed in order to establish this local government service.

77.     In support of this ambitious decentralization agenda, progress was observed on
several fronts. Given that Ghana’s legal framework now clearly makes MMDAs responsible for
delivery of services in their jurisdiction, it is important to rapidly build capacity in this regard and
monitor progress. By 2009, at least 161 of the 170 MMDAs were able to prepare a budget and an
annual allocation plan, as measured by the Functional and Organizational Assessment Tool
(FOAT) used by the District Development Facility (DDF). By the end of 2010, at least half of the
MMDAs were also able to complete monthly financial reports, under the supervision of CAGD.
From 2012, MMDAs will prepare composite budgets that will integrate the currently separate
budgets of de-concentrated central government departments in districts into the budget of district
assemblies, see Annex 3, to have a comprehensive picture of what it takes to manage their
assembly and deliver all services. MMDAs’ Internally Generated Funds (IGF), as measured by
the DDF, also significantly increased between 2008 and 2011. Finally, MOFEP has established a
Fiscal Decentralization Unit which will be taking the lead in the development and implementation
of a revised intergovernmental fiscal framework, including reforms related to IGF, reporting and
auditing.

78.     Energy. Structural progress in the energy sector would also contribute significantly
to macro-economic stabilization and long term growth. Subsidies to the energy sector for
below-cost recovery tariffs and commercial losses absorbed almost 3 percent of GDP in 2008.
Poor management38 and weak governance in the recent past have resulted in the sector being a
burden rather than a resource to the country, and were major factors behind the 2006-07
electricity shortages. These shortages obliged the Government of Ghana to purchase both new
generation plants on a cash basis (and in some cases, off-budget, contributing to the accumulation

38
  At a time when there was a sustained increase in demand for electricity due to rising economic growth, there was
no investment in new generation by public sector between 2000-07, nor private investment, due to the lack of a
proper incentive structure and risk mitigation for independent power producers. The Government decision to restart
production of aluminum by VALCO in 2005 (subsequently closed in 2006) also exacerbated the problem as it obliged
the main public power producer (VRA) to overdraw water from the Volta Lake at a time when it did not have an
adequate thermal reserve margin to fall back on in the event of the poor rains experienced by Ghana in 2006.

                                                   - 30 -
of outstanding commitments to contractors in 2008), as well as pay for fuel, at a time when world
price spiked. Meanwhile, power tariffs remained frozen between November 2007 and June 2010,
while prices in Ghana rose by 50 percent over the same period.

79.      It is in this context that the Government implemented recommendations of the
electricity financial recovery plan approved by Cabinet in 2009. The objective of this plan,
which benefited from stakeholders’ consultation, is to restore financial viability to the three power
utilities (the Volta River Authority, VRA, the Electricity Company of Ghana, ECG, and the
Ghana Grid Company, GRIDCO), improve their commercial and operational performance and put
an end to their dependence on the state budget (see the results framework in Annex 3).
Accordingly, electricity tariffs were revised upwards in June 2010, but for small consumers.39
Greater use of gas (from Nigeria via the West African Gas Pipeline) and good rains in 2010
helped to mitigate the impact on the electricity sector of higher oil prices, but VRA’s financial
situation in 2011 remains fragile. ECG is less exposed to the vagaries of rainfall and erratic gas
supplies but remains burdened by its poor commercial performance, with 25 percent energy
losses. The Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) established and implemented in
March 2011 an electricity automatic tariff adjustment mechanism (PRSG8 prior action), with a
view to avoiding large (because infrequent) and politically difficult tariff adjustments, while
providing greater financial predictability to utilities. The new system has been implemented on a
quarterly basis since March 2011, but due to teething problems, its complexity and opacity,
inadequate explanation and stakeholder consultations, it has yet to prove that it is superior and has
perversely added greater uncertainty to financial planning by the power utilities. Clearly fine
tuning of the quarterly adjustment mechanism will be needed if it is to achieve the goal of greater
predictability and financial sustainability in the power sector.

80.     The Government started to address major contingent liabilities in the petroleum
products distribution sector. The state-owned Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) and Bulk Oil Storage
and Transport Co. Ltd (BOST) built up substantial short-term debts in both local and foreign
currency to banks and crude oil suppliers in 2008. These debts, arising from past under-recovery
of rising oil costs from motorists, were impairing their ability to finance their operations40 and
exposing commercial banks to large non performing loans. In response, the Government made
two financial injections in TOR’s capital in March 2010 (of 1.0 percent of GDP) and March 2011
(of 1.0 percent of GDP), which allowed the refinery to settle its debt to Ghana Commercial Bank,
and partially restore its capacity to operate. The Government also introduced a 30 percent increase
in the regulated price of petroleum products in January 2011 to reduce the potential scope for
under-recovery of costs by TOR, introduced a levy to finance TOR-related bonds debt service,
and submitted to Cabinet for decision, through the Ministries of Energy, and Finance & Economic
Planning an action plan regarding the restoration of Tema Oil Refinery financial sustainability
(PRSG8 prior action). The plan, which foresees the conduction of financial, operational and
management audits (to be completed in 2012), was approved, and its implementation, combined
with the financial measures already taken, is expected to sustainably improve TOR’s operating
efficiency, see the results framework in Annex 3. As the refinery is fully owned by the
Government, restored financial sustainability will also entail lower needs to resort to Budget
resources to absorb TOR’s under-recoveries and resulting debts.

39
    The PURC ruling entailed effective increases (starting June 1, 2010) in residential tariffs between 21 and 34
percent depending on quantities consumed, above 50kw/h per month. Tariffs below this threshold were left
unchanged. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial effective tariffs were respectively raised by 59-112 and 63-116
percent depending on quantities consumed.
40
   In 2010, TOR halted its operations for most of the year.

                                                   - 31 -
81.     The Government also committed to restore in 2012 the automatic adjustment
mechanism for setting petroleum products pump prices. Petroleum prices at the pump which
are currently set administratively by the downstream regulator, the National Petroleum Authority,
are lowest in all of West Africa (outside Nigeria) by a large margin. In addition, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to cover the cost of the large and rapidly growing subsidy on LPG of nearly
US$100 million in 2010 (used both as household cooking fuel as well as for transport, mainly by
public transport vehicles, especially taxis), through higher prices on other products. Consequently,
part of the burden of this subsidy has to be met directly by the Budget. While wishing to
encourage the use of LPG as cooking fuel instead of charcoal, the subsidy is misdirected, since
there is a large leakage to the transport sector that does not merit such support (and which also
reduces Government revenues from taxes on the petrol/diesel that would otherwise have been
consumed in place of LPG). The cost of LPG is half that of gasoline on an energy content basis,
giving motorists a strong incentive to switch. The Government recognizes that should severe
price instability recur, it will need to ensure that fuel subsidies are not generalized as in the past,
but instead targeted only on those fuels that are predominantly used by the poor, such as kerosene
[increasingly less usage nowadays as hurricane lamps are being replaced by battery powered LED
lamps and wood or charcoal are used for cooking]. In parallel, the Government is also exploring
the potential for scaling up more effective safety nets that would not rely on the use of subsidies,
but instead on direct transfers to poor households, as discussed below.

Protecting the Poor
82.     The PRSG8 supports Government’s measures aimed at undertaking policy and
institutional reforms to strengthen existing social protection mechanisms. These measures
are being carried out under the coordination of the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS)
which was published in March 2007 with the goal of “providing policy direction in the protection
of persons living in situations of extreme poverty, vulnerability and exclusion from both expected
and unexpected threats to their livelihoods, with a view to making them effective participants in
the socio-economic development of the country.? In 2010, the Government established the multi-
sectoral National Social Protection Steering Committee, to develop effective coordination across
relevant MDAs and promote a common approach to targeting, see below. The Government has
started a review of the National Social Protection strategy in 2011 with a view to making it more
focused on reaching the poor.

83.     The recent past has seen a quick, but somewhat uncoordinated expansion of social
protection in Ghana. The system now entails a number of small scale efforts that need to be
evaluated before further scaling up, and that also need to be better coordinated. The emerging
system will rely essentially on targeted transfers to households (a combination of means tested
and geographically targeted). Targeting has also been a challenge and it is now recognized that, to
reduce inefficiencies, an integrated approach to targeting is needed for all poverty alleviation
programs. In addition, there are a number of interventions which are presented as social protection
programs but whose impact and effectiveness are yet to be assessed. In the present fiscal
environment, it is important to evaluate the impact of large programs (from a fiscal and
recipients’ perspective) such as the school feeding and youth employment programs, in order to
assess whether these programs are indeed having the desired effect (which might not necessarily




                                              - 32 -
be solely poverty alleviation). This is important for fiscal sustainability41 and Government’s
planning as it thinks ex ante about the crisis’ future impacts and possible policy responses.

84.     In 2010, pro-poor public expenditures were protected, in spite of the strong public
expenditure contraction. Pro-poor expenditures42 were protected in 2010 in relation to total
public expenditures (excluding donor-financed capital expenditures), at 29.0 percent, exceeding
both the end-year target (23.6 percent) and the achievement of 2008 (28.2 percent). Figures up to
September 2011 show similar trend.43 In 2009, the Government also reviewed its classification of
pro-poor expenditures, and concluded to the need to maintain it, for the sake of time consistency.
The review allowed the identification of gaps and shortcoming in the reporting and computation
of pro-poor expenditures, which were both corrected. The Budget 2011 foresees that 24.3 percent
of public expenditure will be spent for poverty reduction. Nevertheless, despite the revision of the
pro-poor definition, two of the largest programs included under this – the National Youth
Employment Program (NYEP) and the Ghana School Feeding Program (GSFP) were poorly
targeted, especially the latter where over 80 percent of the benefits were accruing to the top
quintile. The Government is now working on a new list of schools which will include new
schools which are from the poorer quintiles under an expanded program though there is a
reluctance to drop the original schools. The NYEP’s poor targeting is driven by its focus on
secondary school leavers who tend to come from the better off quintiles. The Government is now
developing a program to rationalize pro-poor expenditures to improve their targeting with support
from DPs.

85.     The Livelihood and Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) program was also
extended. By end-2010, there were 39,146 households registered as LEAP regular beneficiaries
and receiving cash subsidies accordingly, against 8,000 by end-2008. By end-2011, the
Government intends to ensure that 65,000 regular LEAP eligible households receiving the cash
subsidies. The LEAP is a cash transfer program that targets orphans and vulnerable children
through their caregivers, the aged (above 65 years and without subsistence or support) and
persons with severe disabilities without productive capacities. LEAP provides conditional and
unconditional subsistence grants on a graduated payment scale of GH¢8-15 per month to
beneficiaries (depending on the number of dependents). The LEAP program is vertically well
targeted (reaches poor households in areas it works), with an estimated 57 percent share of
outlays reaching the poor. But this relatively better targeting may be due primarily to the fact that
with few recipients in each area easy targets such as orphans and vulnerable child, old age and
disabled dominate the beneficiary group. Efforts are underway now to improve LEAP targeting


41
   Improved targeting mechanisms are also needed to avoid potential risks of fiscal slippage while expanding the
coverage of social programs.
42
   Poverty related expenditures include the following expenditures from the Appropriation Act: (i) Education – non-
formal education, pre-school, basic education, technical & vocational education, teacher training, and education
management and supervision, plus a fraction of the expenditures on special education (90 percent), general
administration (50 percent), etc ; (ii) Health – district health services, regional public health expenditures, oncology
expenditures, funding for the International Red Cross, and health learning materials, plus a fraction of the
expenditures on regional health support services (50 percent), psychiatric hospital (50 percent), regional clinical care
(50 percent), health training institutions (70 percent), institutional care (60 percent), etc ; (iii) Agriculture – crop
services provided through the regional agriculture development units and projects funded by IDA; (iv) Works and
Housing – the community water and sanitation, rural housing and rural hydrological drainage; (v) Feeder Roads and
Transport – feeder roads and road safety; (vi) Energy – rural electrification programs; and (vii) Other – national
vocational training, social welfare programs, etc.
43
   At 26.9 percent of total public expenditures for the period January-September 2011, pro-poor expenditures were
exceeding the target set for the full year 2011, 24.3 percent.

                                                      - 33 -
beyond these easily identified categories and to this a new targeting formula has been developed
and is currently being applied to new entrants.

86.     The National Health Insurance has become an important instrument of social
protection but its financial sustainability is now in question. In 2004, a National Health
Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was launched to replace the system of user fees, which were creating
financial barriers to accessing health care. Funding for the NHIS is generated from multiple
sources, including a 2.5 percent VAT, 2.5 percent transfer from the social security fund, and
income-based premiums. The NHIS is playing an increasingly important part in financing
curative care in Ghana, providing 41 percent of the total resource envelope for 2009. While
coverage, utilization and financial data show positive progress in the implementation of the NHIS,
many challenges remain including: the NHIS is not adequately reaching the poor and informal
sector (in spite of free access for indigents); the current claims reimbursement mechanism and
increased utilization are escalating health care costs and constraining supply; the administration
and organizational structure of the insurance program has led to delays in reimbursing claims by
health care providers; and plans to expand the scope of the NHIS without adequate preparation
could potentially threaten its financial sustainability. With World Bank Technical Assistance, the
Government is currently undertaking a review of the NHIS from an accessibility and financial
sustainability perspective and plans to use the same new targeting formula used for LEAP but
with a different cut-off point.

87.     In 2010, the Government agreed on assignment of institutional responsibilities,
budget, detail objectives, action plan and timeline for the adoption and use of a common
targeting mechanism for the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) & School Uniform Programme. The mechanism, based on
proxy means test (PMT), is foreseen as a decisive step towards a common approach including a
national single register. Subsequently, the Government, through the Ministry of Employment and
Social Welfare, pre-tested and validated the Common Targeting mechanism, in collaboration with
Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Education, Local Government & Rural Development (PRSG8
prior action), for application to LEAP, NHIS indigent and School uniforms programs in pilot
areas. Moving forward, the mechanism will be expanded nationwide. The PMT scores will need
to be higher for cash transfer such as LEAP and lower for more broadly targeted programs such as
school uniforms. Once the PMT is fully functional it can be used as a basis for the eventual
common register. The PMT has now been field tested and found to be robust and is currently
being applied for LEAP and NHIS new entrants. Thus, the Government intends to establish a
Single Register to ensure better targeting of social protection programs. Over time, it is expected
that a growing proportion of new LEAP regular beneficiaries will be identified using the common
targeting mechanism, see the results framework in Annex 3.

88.      The common targeting system on the surface may not have much relevance for the
North given the high levels of poverty – geographic targeting may work just as well.
Nevertheless, there are good reasons to believe that this can have some impact. First of all the
North is not monolithic – there are districts with a 80 percent head count poverty as well as
districts with much lower poverty levels but all of the districts would have significantly large
numbers of poor people thus the common targeting system would help. In addition, to the extent
that common targeting allows the Government to divert resources from non-targeted programs to
targeted programs, the government can help a higher proportion of the poor than without the
system – also proportionately benefiting the North more.

Developing the Oil and Gas Institutional Framework
89.     Oil has been produced in Ghana since December 2010 and production from the
Jubilee field is expected to peak at 120,000 barrel per day in 2012. Following the confirmation
of substantial oil and gas reserves several offshore fields, the Government has been moving
forward on several fronts to enable these resources to be exploited in an economically rational
manner, while ensuring that the impacts of the new oil and gas industry will be handled in an
environmentally and socially sensitive manner. The Government is cognizant of the poor track
record of other low-income oil producing countries and also of the high expectations of the
electorate that these national resources be exploited in a transparent manner for the general good
of the nation. World Bank / IMF estimates based on proven reserves and projections of world
crude prices of US$75/bbl (constant prices 2008) indicate that Ghana’s net annual receipts from
oil production would be about US$1 billion annually on average over the period 2011-29. 44

90.     Gas is being produced in association with oil and is currently being re-injected or
flared. Following the recommendations of a presidential task force, government has now formed
the Ghana National Gas Company to construct the pipeline and processing infrastructure needed
to commercialize associated gas. A portion of the $3 billion infrastructure loan from the China
Development Bank is earmarked to finance these projects. Although government sees the first
gas infrastructure projects as being entirely publicly owned, subsequent projects may be carried
out by means of joint ventures with private investors. With this in mind, the Government intends
to adopt a gas commercialization and pricing policy in 2012 to provide the predictability,
transparency, and incentives needed for private participation, particularly for the development of
non-associated gas fields where there is no oil to carry the burden of initial field development
costs. The Government sees gas as a major input to power generation and industrial
development.45 However, the gas infrastructure projects themselves are still only at the design
stage and risk is growing that limits on Jubilee’s ability to re-inject gas will cause additional
flaring and curtailment of oil production.

91.     In April 2011, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 815 was adopted by
Parliament and assented by the President. Benefiting from extensive public consultations
based on a first proposal for a bill, World Bank staff concur with Revenue Watch Institute’s View
that the Act provides a strong framework for the collection and management of oil and gas
revenue, establishing a clear system of controls for the collection of oil revenues and their
allocation to the budget and the proposed stabilization and heritage funds, a clear division of
responsibilities among authorities, reasonable rules for managing the investments of the funds,
and strong oversight and transparency provisions. The Act retains inter alia the principles that all
petroleum revenue from upstream and midstream activities will be collected in a single account at
the BoG and will be accounted for in the budget; that the maximum annual budget funding
44
   Since the Jubilee field development plan was approved, exploration has led to further discoveries, so that the oil
resources that could eventually be developed would support production over a longer period than the current first
phase of Jubilee alone.
45
   Unlike oil and natural gas liquids, dry gas cannot be easily stored and exported. But with the availability of a gas
pipeline, several downstream activities could be undertaken, the most immediate being electricity generation through
the conversion of existing and planned power stations from oil to gas, which would generate significant cost
reduction. Further value added could be generated by supplying gas to industries needing a direct heating source,
such as cement, food processing, smelting, etc. LNG, methanol or other large-scale gas conversion and export
projects would require much larger gas reserves than currently assessed – at least double, given the large fixed capital
costs needed to develop these activities over a long period of time in highly competitive global markets. In all events,
the intended use of the gas rent would require transparent decision making, notably through the adoption of a
commercial and pricing policy, as for any other public resource.

amount will be determined by law based on a pre-identified benchmark revenue; and that once in
the budget, petroleum income will be treated just as the same as any other government income.
The Act also foresees the establishment of a stabilization fund and a heritage fund (whose
resource are to be invested in qualifying instruments abroad), both to be governed by law, and
overseen by the Parliament. As such, the Act, if properly implemented, would reduce risks of
mismanagement of various kinds. The absence of provisions for earmarking oil revenues to be
transferred to the budget will also provide greater flexibility to address shocks and reduce risks of
potential political capture of the resource.

92.     Transparency and accountability provisions in the Petroleum Revenue Management
Act will be complemented with the extension of EITI principles to the oil and gas sectors. In
2010, The Government approved a revised Ghana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(GHEITI) institutional framework including the oil and gas sectors. The revised framework
should improve transparency and accountability on payments made by oil companies to
Government and revenues the Government receives from oil companies through independent
auditing. The extension to new sectors also required extending the GHEITI steering committee46
to the Ministry of Energy, GNPC, oil companies, CSO and districts assemblies’ representatives
from the oil finds areas, learning from the performance of the mining sector in terms of
addressing potential governance vulnerabilities along the chain of actions entailed from deciding
to extract the resource to using it for the sustainable development of the country. Ghana has
strongly committed itself to learn from the lessons of other countries where oil has proved a curse,
rather than a blessing, and ensure that it receives the maximum benefits from these sectors, and
does so in a transparent as well as an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. Moving
forward, the Government intends to ensure the EITI framework becomes legally binding.

93.    Government efforts in the sector now focus on developing a regulatory framework to
encourage the sound and sustainable development of the oil and gas industry. Initial
stakeholders’ consultations held in 2010 on the oil and gas regulatory framework raised
fundamental issues of ownership, participation and control, roles, responsibilities and
accountability, legitimacy and capacity of institutions that underpin effective performance of such
a green field sector in the Ghanaian economy. Consultations suggested in particular that more
time and attention should be devoted to reaching a consensus on (i) the key features of the
proposed new Ghana petroleum regulatory authority, including the scope of responsibility of the
regulator; and (ii) the local content aspects. Discussions also underlined the urgent need for a
major capacity building program to endow the Government with the skills needed to oversee and
regulate the nascent oil and gas industry, to which the World Bank responded positively along
with Norway via the Oil & Gas Capacity Building Project.

94.     As a result of these consultations, the Government embarked on a plan to enact the
necessary regulatory framework. Government, through the Ministry of Energy, submitted to
Cabinet for decision a policy proposal establishing a petroleum regulatory authority (PRSG8 prior
action). The proposal, which was subject to broad and meaningful public consultations with
stakeholders, was adopted and the Petroleum Commission Act 821 enacted by Parliament. A new
petroleum exploration and production law was drafted and submitted to Parliament, to be debated
in the session from October-December 2011.



46
  The Ghana EITI national steering committee, extended to oil and gas sector representatives, was inaugurated in
September 2010.

95.     While difficult to measure quantitatively, it is expected that actions supported by
PRSC7 and PRSG8 will improve the way the oil industry is regulated and managed through
greater transparency and executive accountability. The results framework developed in Annex
3 will monitor the publication of EITI reconciliation reports on oil and petroleum receipts reports.

                                Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The Government of Ghana developed the GSGDA, on the basis of which the PRSG8 was prepared, through broad consultations on
issues and challenges in promoting growth and reducing poverty. Several workshops were carried out during the preparation of the
GSGDA with a view to: (i) reviewing the draft document for each thematic area, and examining the policy actions needed to
achieve the GSGDA goals; (ii) ranking and prioritizing the proposed set of policy actions according to agreed criteria; and (iii)
strengthening policy synergies between and across sectors by identifying complementarities and overlaps.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework

The PRSG8 is part of a concerted effort with development partners grouped around the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS).
The MDBS aims at reducing the Government’s transaction costs in dealing with development assistance by ensuring greater
complementarity between this assistance and the Government’s own poverty reduction strategy. Over the last eight years,
development partners have followed through with this commitment by carrying out joint missions, advancing agreements on
policy actions and the timing of assessment reviews. DPs also agreed with the Government on a joint matrix of policy actions to be
supported, aligning almost all aspects of their monitoring and evaluation frameworks, except those regarding the use of outcome
indicators as a basis for disbursement. The MDBS endeavors to increasingly focus on the cross-cutting issues, as well as policy
actions that either have economy-wide implications or require collaboration between agencies. As its predecessors, the proposed
operation is peer reviewed by the MDBS rotating co-chair, in consultation with MDBS members.

Principle 3: Balancing Predictability and Flexibility

The timing, design and scope of the operation is customized to Ghana’s country circumstances and acknowledges the need to act
quickly and flexibly while helping the Government signal its continued commitment to reform. In 2009, a retreat between the
Government and DPs acknowledged the need to introduce greater flexibility in the PAF to allow for the inclusion of triggers
addressing unforeseen shocks to preserve PAF longer term objectives. The possibility to amend the PAF 2010-12 was not used by
the Government.

Principle 4: Streamlining critical actions for achieving results

In the proposed operation, prior actions for disbursement are limited to eight critical actions in the implementation of the
Government’s program. The Government matrix contains thirty nine actions (see Annex 4), reflecting its policy program in 2010-
12 in support of the GSGDA.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support

The review of Government performance in meeting PRSG8 prior actions was mainly conducted at the MDBS annual review (May
16-17 and 19, 2011), which was timed to coincide with the completion of the Government’s own draft Annual Progress Report.
The MDBS is making a concerted effort to better align the budget support provided with the budget cycle and with the
Government M&E , and is currently exploring various options of reform in this domain, as a follow up to the MDBS retreat of
October 2009. A new retreat between the Government of Ghana and MDBS DPs will review in 2012 the relevance of the
instrument to support Ghana’s Development Objectives. Particular attention will be put on MDBS alignment to the budget cycle,
PAF content, and inclusion and participation of various public institutions.

                            5. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                 A.      PARTICIPATION PROCESS

96.     The specific reforms supported by the proposed PRSG8 comprise critical elements of
the GSGDA, whose preparation benefited from some information sharing and consultations
within the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC). With the appointment of
new Chairman and Commissioners in the first half of 2010, the new National Development
Planning Commission only had limited time for extensive formal consultations around the content
of the GSGDA which had been drafted earlier in 2009 by NDPC services (and served as input to
the preparation of the Budget 2010, see below). Under the leadership of the new Chair of the
Commission, however, sector groups comprising a good cross section of technical experts were
established and have provided input and guidance to the development of the GSGDA. Going
forward, the GSGDA outlines plans for more systematic and extensive consultations as part of the
regular planning process. The GSGDA notes that public consultation constitutes an integral part
of the development planning process and notes that by having all political parties represented in
the NDPC, Ghana's development plans would benefit from more continuity and sustainability.

97.    The Budget (2011 and 2012), presented to the Parliament after hearings from MDAs
and CSOs, seeks to implement the GSGDA. Budget Statements in these two years reflect
GSGDA major features, including macroeconomic stabilization, agricultural modernization,
productive infrastructure and social protection, within a medium term framework. Some prior
actions supported by the proposed operation also directly benefited from strong consultations
process with relevant stakeholders, in particular for the adoption of the Second Financial Sector
Development Strategic Plan, the Comprehensive Decentralization Policy, the petroleum
regulatory authority and the Common Targeting Mechanism.

98.     The PRSG8 also seeks to provide objective information, promote debate and support
coalitions for pro poor reforms in areas addressed by this operation. Specifically, the
operation seeks to foster a dialogue among a range of civil society organizations, academics,
direct stakeholders and the Government on the design of policy reform and its implementation.
Efforts undertaken under the MDBS to foster direct dialogue between the Government and Civil
Society Organizations (CSOs) – the Aid Effectiveness and Oil and Gas Platforms notably – in
Sector Working Groups and at the annual review will be pursued and expanded, as well as
between Parliament and DPs (through the institutionalization in 2010 of a Development Platform
at Parliament, where DPs gather twice a year with the Speaker, Majority and Minority Leaders
and Members of Parliament). Efforts will also be expanded to foster direct dialogue between
Ghanaian think tanks and the Government, possibly through MDBS. In December 2010, a two-
day round table involving all major think tanks was organized to discuss immediate development
policy trade-offs (fiscal framework, resource mobilization, public sector reform, debt
restructuring, and institutions for sound economic governance), engaging the Government for
further direct dialogue. In 2011, CSO and think tank participation to the MDBS Annual Review
was large and acknowledged constructive by the Government and DPs. In 2011, the World Bank
also started to help the various political parties identify development policy areas (e.g. value for
money, fiscal responsibility, natural resource management) and institutional set-ups for greater
collaboration. The World Bank’s role in these dialogues will continue to be as a facilitator rather
than a direct participant, since the objective of the dialogues is for national counterparts to discuss
facts and come up with home grown solutions.

                                     B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

99.     Measures supported by the proposed operation are not expected to have any
significant negative impact on the environment. The implementation of measures to improve
public financial management (commitment controls), the classification of SAs, the validation of
the common targeting mechanism, and the adoption of the decentralization policy and the second
financial sector strategic plan, are all environmentally neutral. The adoption of the electricity
automatic tariff adjustment mechanism could improve energy conservation, and is not expected to
induce any significant switching to dirty energy in net terms. In Ghana, electricity is used for
lighting and running appliances, but not widely for cooking, as reported in the various GLSSs. As
such, electricity tariff increases could only induce switching to kerosene for lighting, but such a
substitution effect is expected to be negligible given that poor households (typically the most
sensitive to changes in relative prices of energy given its importance in overall budget)47 will not
be affected, see below. Besides, a greater use of kerosene would be offset by a lower use of crude
oil to generate electricity, as Ghana utility companies would use this theoretical opportunity to
reduce their average cost through higher resort to hydroelectric generation in relative terms. The
establishment of a petroleum regulatory authority is expected to better adapt Ghana’s
environmental institutional framework to the emergence of an oil industry. The progressive
restoration of TOR financial sustainability through improved operating efficiency is expected to
lead to a reduction in polluting emissions and toxic waste disposal.

100. More generally, the Government’s reform agenda builds on Ghana’s robust
environmental institutional framework and considerable capacities to set environmental
management norms. The institutional framework is defined by the 1991 National Environmental
Policy, the 1992 National Environmental Action Plan, and the 1994 Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Act. The EPA has since the late 1980s adopted Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIAs) as a management tool to screen undertakings likely to pose adverse impact
on the environment. EIAs became mandatory in 1999 and are applied to all development projects
and programs that have the potential to give rise to significant social and environmental impacts.
EIAs are mandatory for seventeen types of activities classified as critical, including mining,
petroleum and gas field development and exploration, construction of dams, harbors and roads,
and logging and disposal of timber. In addition, the EPA has been one of the leading users in
Africa of Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) as a tool for the assessment of major policies,
programs and investments.

101. The onset of oil and gas production and the enactment of the Petroleum Commission
Act 821 are not expected to affect Ghana’s environmental institutional framework.
Management of environmental impacts of offshore petroleum exploration in Ghana will hinge
directly upon the EPA, as Ghana’s environmental regulator, and indirectly upon the Ministry of
Energy which sets energy policy; the newly established Petroleum Commission as economic
regulator for the sector; and the Ghana Maritime Authority which provides maritime oversight
and regulation. The EPA is currently developing the Environmental Management, Health and
Safety, and Community Issues (EMHSCI) component of the Oil and Gas Master Plan so as to
fully mainstream and integrate environmental management, health and safety, and community
issues into the petroleum sector operations. The EPA is also a member of the Board of the
Petroleum Commission.

102. The assessment of environmental and social risks (including from oil and gas) builds
on Ghana’s earlier efforts to comprehend the impact of development policy, so as to develop
corresponding preventive and mitigation/remediation plans. The Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) was designed in 2004, and introduced as a process tool to evaluate the
potential environmental (natural resources management linkage), social (poverty indicators,
livelihoods and health impacts and vulnerability impacts on the poor) and institutional
(institutional targeted impacts) effects of the GPRS (and successors) and any plans or programs
that may be derived. Consultations were carried out with MDAs, CSOs, NGOs and DPs, leading
to recommendations aimed at refining policies, and giving greater focus to environmental issues
in articulating strategies for sustainable development. Specific recommendations included
proposed actions on the rural environment, natural resource management, disaster prevention, and
‘green’ taxes and accounting.

                                      C.      SOCIAL ASPECTS

103. Measures supported by the proposed operation are expected to have a significant
positive and direct effect on poverty reduction. These include: (i) the strengthening of social
protection through the adoption of a common targeting mechanism; (ii) strengthening public
financial management for a better budget allocative efficiency in support of the GSGDA, (iii)
restoring the financial viability of the electricity and petroleum sector, which is critical for pro-
poor economic growth and employment creation, and (iv) promoting decentralization to better
address local needs and foster executive accountability. More broadly, the proposed operation
will support the macro-economic stabilization program, thus reducing the poor’s and near poor’s
exposure to macro-economic shocks.

104. The Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of electricity tariff increases in
2010 suggests an insignificant impact on poverty. This conclusion originated from the fact that
households consuming less than 50 kWh per month were shielded from tariff increases. The
electricity automatic tariff adjustment mechanism maintained this provision and as such its
implementation is not likely to impact poverty.

105. Decisions taken by the Government on Subvented Agencies did not warrant a PSIA
at this stage, unlike initially envisaged under the PRSC7. The decision involves the signature
of performance contracts between subvented agencies and relevant ministries with a view to
monitor SA performance before final decision can be made on their future. As such, no SA is
foreseen to change status in a near future, with thus no direct consequence on its employees.

                                 D.        FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT

106. Public financial management is solid enough to warrant the continuation of
Development Policy Operations. Analytical work undertaken by Development Partners in
collaboration with the Government highlighted the strong foundation being built towards
strengthening PFM in Ghana. PEFA 2010 and the ERPFM 2010 reports, as well as the IMF FAD
report of 2010 and their subsequent mission reports confirm that Ghana has built a solid legal and
regulatory framework and foundation for public financial management that performs at an
average level and occasionally above-average standards, see Box 2. Timeliness in financial
reporting, despite weaknesses in comprehensiveness, has improved markedly, and so was the
effectiveness of external audit, its compliance with international standards as well coverage. A
strong Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, reinvigorated since 2009, is currently in place
and its proceedings are open to the public and on both print media and television. A further

                                              - 42 -
strengthening of this legislative oversight role, including a more systematic and aggressive follow
up on audit findings will support the entrenchment of accountability and transparency within the
public financial management realm. Reform successes in the area of public procurement are also
quite encouraging as revealed by the PPA’s use of the Public Procurement Model of Excellence
as a self-assessment tool. As against a target of 80 percent set by EGPRC/MDBS for assessment
of performance of high spending entities in public procurement in 2008, actual performance
realized were 97.6 percent, 95.2 percent, and 81.6 percent respectively for (a) use of appropriate
procurement methods, (b) publication of tender notices, and (c) publication of award of contracts.
A lot more remains to be done in the area of improving public procurement systems, however.
Using the results of an analysis by the Bank, using the OECD-DAC tool, it has been concluded
that Ghana still needs to further improve the efficiency of the national procurement systems by
strengthening the legislative framework, enhancing institutional development capacity,
streamlining operations, and increasing transparency. Although government comments to these
reforms remain in place, progress towards their implementation continues to be slow.

107. But fiduciary issues remain in terms of budget execution. The implementation of an
effective cash management system, the treasury single account, and the full reinstatement of
commitment controls in all MDAs, will lower the risk of expenditure slippages and support the
predictability of resource flows to MDAs. The planned transfer of Subvented Agencies’ payroll to
the computerized human resource management system (IPPD-2), especially under the auspices of
the GIFMIS project, will also allow closer monitoring of the public sector size and improved
payroll management. Besides, increased oversight and control of public investments should
include: (i) better screening of public investment proposals; and (ii) broadening oversight over the
finances of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). As part of the larger Government program aimed at
addressing these issues, the proposed operation aims at further reducing fiduciary risks by
supporting specific policy actions aimed leveraging the planned implementation of an effective
cash management and commitment control system.

108. Upgrading, stabilizing, and rolling-out of a fully Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) for budget management is critical to sustaining
success in both the maintenance of fiscal discipline and the effective and timely monitoring
of overall government finances. To this end, the Government has commenced the
implementation of the GIFMIS project which seeks to support government in reversing the key
inherent weaknesses in its fiduciary control environment as also elaborated in Section 4B. The
project has the full government ownership and unflinching commitment at the highest level to
address the key challenges involved in the budgeting, accounting, and reporting systems,
processes, and practices across government. While the project was slow to commence produce
visible reform results, it has now begun to implement the basic treasury systems across MDAs
and is fully geared to bring in greater budget management practices with effect from the fiscal
year 2012, when the system would have matured to deliver expected results.

109. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana in 2009. Under the
Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to an update
assessment with respect to a new PRGF arrangement approved July 15 2009; the assessment,
completed on December 2, 2009, followed an initial safeguards assessment from October 2003.
The update assessment found that while the safeguards framework of the BoG has been
strengthened in several areas since then, new risks in governance oversight emerged with the
removal of the former Board in January 2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge, in the start of
the successor Board. Pending the resumption of Board activities some interim measures have


                                             - 43 -
been introduced to provide an independent oversight mechanism. These include the introduction
of an Advisory Panel comprised of three outside members responsible for the external and
internal audit and controls systems. In March 2010, the authorities have advised staff that a new
Board has been appointed. They have also either committed to or implemented all measures
proposed by staff.

110. Overall, the fiduciary risk of the operation is rated ‘moderate’. This is based on the
results of the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Bank of Ghana, the improvements already
made as well as the demonstrated commitment of the Government to implementing other wide
ranging reforms in the area of PFM, including public procurement.

                              Box 2: Ghana’s Public Financial Management Systems
Credibility of the Budget. Actual primary expenditure compared with budgeted expenditure shows significant deviations at both
the aggregate and compositional levels. Aggregate deviation for 2008 was a high of 32.3%, but went down to 12.5% and 0.4% in
2009 and 2010. Resulting from the arrears brought forward from 2008, the expenditure compositional variance for 2009 increased
to 22.8% in 2009, up from 15.7% in 2008. In 2010 however, the compositional variance was reduced to 15.1%. One of the root
causes of weak budget credibility has been the weak expenditure planning and failure to recognize and fully budget year-end
commitments in subsequent year’s budgets. Also, the largely ineffective establishment and commitment controls, complicated
further by unpredictable budget releases, undermined efforts to maintain expenditure within budget ceilings. The improved realism
in revenue budgeting was however reported to have cushioned the impact of reduced overall budget credibility in 2010.

Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. While the budget documentation is fairly complete, comprehensible and
comprehensive, and is made publicly available, the budget classification system was, up to 2011, not yet fully GFS compliant and
is incapable of directly supporting a functional outcome budget management process. This is notwithstanding the fact that the
categorization of the administrative classification elements allows some linkage to the National Development Strategic
Framework. Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations also requires improvement. Nevertheless, in 2011, the
government has begun the implementation of a GFS-compliant chart of classification in the preparation of its budget for 2012.
Since 2006, budgets have been systematically presented and published in a timely manner, including the Budget for 2012.

Policy-based Budgeting. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years – in as much as the approaches instituted
remain severely constrained – Ghana’s performance is held back by limited ability to cost strategies, the absence of a transparent
link between planned and executed budget activities, and the lack of an effective feedback mechanism. The underlying
institutional arrangements to support a policy based budget process are absent despite the adoption of a single stage coordinated
budget process for recurrent and development budgets. In spite of the underlying weaknesses in its implementation experience, the
Government has adopted a three-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework for its budgetary processes. The Government has, in
2011, piloted the implementation of a program-based budgeting framework for two MDAs and is committed to roll it out to all
MDAs commencing 2013.

Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. While Ghana’s central government scores well overall with respect to some
aspects of revenue administration, debt management, payroll management and procurement, overall predictability and control in
budget execution remain areas of concern. The specific areas of concern include the discretionary elements of the legal and
regulatory framework for revenue management, the controls in the taxpayer registration system, the predictability in the
availability of funds for the commitment of expenditures, the extent of consolidation of the Government’s bank cash balances, the
effectiveness of the establishment control, and the effectiveness of the commitment control. Cash management remains a particular
challenge to the PFM systems, as well as the apparent lack of effective procurement planning as part of the budget process.
Although the legal and regulatory framework is clear on the controls for each of the main steps of the procurement and
expenditure cycle, these are not applied uniformly across all MDAs. The internal audit units are well structured although their
focus continues to include pre-audit functions as well – a factor that undermines their independence. Going forward, the
government, under the GIFMIS project, has begun the final design process of the automated information system to implement an
effective commitment control, including budget checks, as of the start of the 2012 budget execution process.

Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Within 4 – 6 weeks after each month-end, the CAGD-managed bank accounts are
reconciled, following clear guidelines and procedures contained in the Accounting Manual. For the other government accounts, the
retained IGF bank accounts, statutory funds, and those related to development partner funded projects, these remain outside this
arrangement. The retained IGF accounts are reconciled quarterly in some ministries, but at least annually for all in the preparation
of the final accounts. Suspense accounts are also reconciled and cleared, but mainly annually, as part of the year-end closing of
accounts. Data integrity however remains a source of concern, especially in the absence of full consolidation of all government
fund types. The monthly financial statements produced, within 4 – 6 weeks after month-end, do not report on expenditure at the
time of commitment but only when actual expenditures have been made. This form of presentation permits only a partial (non-
consolidated) comparison of revenues and expenditures to the original budget appropriations. Timeliness in preparing the Public
Accounts (Consolidated Fund) by the CAGD is achieved as they are submitted within 3 months of end of fiscal year; and the
accounts are largely consistent with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial
reporting. Accounting, recording, and reporting are predominantly paper-based at MDAs. However, the CAGD, under the
GIFMIS project, has commenced the implementation of the General Ledger and ‘Procure to Pay’ modules of the IFMIS for all
MDAs for the budget 2011 to ensure that consolidation in accordance with the GFS-compliant chart of accounts is achieved with
increased reliability, comprehensiveness, and timeliness.

External Scrutiny and Audit. Submission of audit reports to the legislature is, generally, timely - within 3 months and 6 to 9
months after receipt of draft accounts for the consolidated fund and the MDAs’ accounts respectively. The scope and nature of
audits performed is satisfactory, although much of risk-based focus is required despite audits being largely compliant with
international standards. Effective follow up on audit reports has begun but would need reinforcement to be more effective. With
procedures for review of budget documentation by the legislature being firmly established and respected in terms of available
review time, the scope of the scrutiny as well as the failure in respecting the rules for in-year budget adjustments hampers
performance against this PFM dimension. Examination and completion of reviews of audit reports by the Public Accounts
Committee remain untimely notwithstanding the presence of a more aggressive parliamentary public accounts committee.

                             E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

111. Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed operation is a one-tranche IDA
grant of SDR64.5 million (US$100 million equivalent). The grant disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for development policy operations. The administration of this grant
will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning.

112. Funds flow arrangements. The Government of Ghana shall identify a Foreign Exchange
Account with the Bank of Ghana and which forms part of the country’s official foreign exchange
reserves, into which the proceeds of the Grant will be disbursed upon meeting the agreed prior
actions and upon Grant effectiveness. The Ghana Cedi equivalent of the funds in the Account
will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund of the Government of
Ghana, and the amount recorded appropriately in the financial management system of the
Government of Ghana.

113. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Ghana shall not
be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed.
The proceeds of the Grant shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative
list as defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of the Grant is used
to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement,
IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to
the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be
cancelled from the Grant.

114. Assurance Requirements. Based on the moderate fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the Grant in terms of a
requirement for an audit. However, within seven days of the disbursement of the Grant by IDA,
the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning. Ghana shall provide a
written confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Ghana Cedi equivalent of the Grant into
the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Ghana, the number of the account, the date
of the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the Grant currency into Ghana Cedi, and
confirming that the said amount has been appropriately accounted for in the recipient's financial
management system. In addition, as the Controller & Accountant General’s Department is
required by law to submit its annual report and the audited accounts on the public consolidated
fund to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year, a copy of the said reports and
accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month after the lapse of the 6 month period. The
Government shall equally ensure that the annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Ghana
(BoG), audited in accordance with international standards on auditing as promulgated by the
International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

115. The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the receipt and
accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the Recipient. Upon the
Association’s request, the Recipient shall: (i) have the account and the recording of amounts of
the Grant into the Recipient’s budget management system audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently applied auditing standards
acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case
no later than four months after the date of the Association’s request for such audit, a certified
copy of the audit report by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall
have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association such other information concerning


                                             - 46 -
the said account and recording of Grant amounts into the budget management system, and the
audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably requested.

                  F.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

116. The Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning would be responsible for the overall
implementation of the proposed PRSG8. Bank supervision will be aligned with the
Government’s monitoring and evaluation framework for the GSGDA through the MDBS review
process, focusing on the year-long verification process that monitors the implementation of the
policies being supported by the PRSG8.

117. During the period of implementation of the program supported by the proposed
PRSG8 a series of reports would assist in monitoring progress: (i) MOFEP detailed monthly
reports on budget developments (revenue, expenditure, financing, as posted on the MOFEP
website) with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each month, (ii) MDAs and NDPC
annual progress reports, (iii) IMF ECF reviews and Article IV reports, (vi) MDBS annual review
2011 aide memoire, and (vii) official documents (e.g., memoranda, gazette) as means of
verification of effective policy decisions.

118. The Results Framework in Annex 3 provides the list of outcome indicators to
monitor the progress over time of the proposed programmatic series of PRSC7 and PRSG8.
The latter were agreed upon with the Government of Ghana. The results framework is an
endeavor to identify expected quantifiable medium term outcomes resulting from policy actions
supported by the programmatic series of DPOs, for its ex-post evaluation by the World Bank
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), after the closing of the series. Lessons learned from the
evaluation will in turn inform the design of possible follow-up Development Policy Operations.

119. In alignment to the MDBS framework, the review of Ghana’s performance in
meeting proposed PRSG8 prior actions was conducted at the MDBS annual review 2011
(May 16-17 and 19, 2011). The review, organized under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning, gathered other three days high-level participants from Government,
Development Agencies, Civil Society Organizations, think tanks and media. Development
Partners considered the review as the “one of the most constructive to date – with deep dialogue
and discussions of the main policy issues of the day, good participation by government agencies,
and active engagement of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)?, noting that “ Ownership by
Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) has improved since they have started signing the
Progress Assessment Framework (PAF)?, and that the “MDBS process is becoming an instrument
for improved coordination between MDAs?.

                              G.     RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

120.   The proposed operation comprises significant potential risks, namely:

      Political feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment (opposition to increased tariffs
       and taxes, large wage bill increases, and demand for new investment programs financed
       with current and future oil revenues) with new elections looming, which could re-ignite
       inflation, impair debt sustainability and further increase banks’ vulnerabilities. The
       proposed programmatic operation mitigate some of these risks of fiscal slippages by
       supporting actions to prevent further public expenditure arrears accumulation, strengthen
       cost-recovery mechanisms in utilities, and implement the second financial sector strategic


                                            - 47 -
       plan for greater financial stability. Risks are also mitigated by demand for good
       governance activities supported by the World Bank, as well as the centralization of the
       public wage negotiations scheme through the adoption of the Single Spine Salary
       Structure;

      External risks associated to a deteriorated global economic environment, affecting
       Ghana’s terms of trade, remittances and official development assistance from OECD
       countries. Better initial conditions (high foreign currency reserves, low public financing
       needs, stable inflation expectations), oil-related stabilization mechanisms (hedging
       scheme, stabilization fund), would reduce the impact of external shocks on the domestic
       economy and balance of payments;

      Implementation risks, as actions supported by the series mostly comprise policy designs
       and approvals. Ghana’s recent track record of reforms indeed suggests that, while
       necessary, policy approvals do not always constitute sufficient conditions for
       implementation. Besides, larger resort to non concessional financing for public investment
       could also affect the quality of project implementation. The complementarity of the
       proposed programmatic operation with ongoing World Bank projects in PFM, energy,
       public sector reform (decentralization) and social protection mitigate such risks;

      Energy-related risks of various natures, including lower rains than expected, lower flows
       of gas from Nigeria than planned, delays in Ghana gas infrastructure completion, which
       could all have negative implications for budget execution (through the accrual of larger
       contingent liabilities in electricity utilities). The implementation of the automatic tariff
       adjustment mechanism supported by the proposed programmatic operation reduce such
       risks;

      Natural disasters, given the relatively high exposure of Ghana’s population to multiple
       natural hazards, in particular in the North were poverty is concentrated. The adoption of
       the common targeting mechanism supported by the proposed operation reduces such risks,
       and is complemented by several other Government, World Bank and DPs activities to
       expand social protection and economic opportunities in the North.

121. In IDA’s assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA’s assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

Mr. Robert Zoellick
President
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Zoellick,

EIGHTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT (PRSG -8)
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

INTRODUCTION
1.         On behalf of the Republic of Ghana, I write to request the Eighth Poverty
           Reduction Support Grant (PRSG–8) from the International Development
           Association (IDA) to support the policies and programmes outlined in the Ghana
           Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) - 2010-2013. This letter sets
           out actions that the Government of the Republic of Ghana (Government) will
           undertake over the medium term to implement its development programme, as
           also reflected in the Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS) Progress Assessment
           Framework (PAF) 2010-2012, developed in collaboration with the World Bank
           team and other Development Partners.
2.         As you are already aware, the Government has in the last three years been
           engaged in a multi-year macroeconomic stabilization program to bring back its
           fiscal standing to a sound and sustainable track. The stabilization gains achieved
           since 2009 now need to be consolidated to pave the way for a developmental and
           sustainable use of Ghana’s oil revenue.
3.         Government’s actions are aimed at consolidating ongoing fiscal stabilization
           efforts and protect the development objectives set in the GSGDA. The GSGDA
           emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization and greater executive
           efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the
           reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities. Specifically, the PRSG-8
           will support continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i)
           restore budgetary discipline and financial stability and (ii) foster public sector

     Received on December 23, 2011.


                                            - 50 -
     reform and strengthen sustainability in the energy sector, while (iii) protecting the
     poor; and (iv) developing the oil and gas institutional framework.

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.   Ghana’s economy has shown strong signs of stability since 2009, and has been
     able to withstand the impact of the global financial crisis. During this period both
     fiscal and current account deficits have been significantly reduced and inflation
     has been reduced to single digit from 20.7 percent in June 2009 to 8.4 percent in
     September 2011. The stock of international reserves has risen close to US$4.98
     billion as of October, 2011 from about US$2.0 billion in 2008. With the robust
     performance in the non-oil sector and the start of oil production, real GDP growth
     for 2011 is provisionally estimated at 13.6 percent as of end September 2011.
5.   In 2010, the rebasing and revision of the national accounts have raised Ghana’s
     national income by more than 60 per cent, moving the country to lower middle-
     income status. The improvement in growth performance has been led by the
     services sector which grew by 4.2 percent and contributed 48.1 percent to GDP.
     The economy is however still dominated by the agriculture sector, with a growth
     rate of 2.8 percent in 2010. The low growth record of the agricultural sector is
     explained by the decline in reforestation activities which led to a drastic
     contraction of the forestry and logging subsector by 14.0 percent.
6.   Over the medium-term, the industrial sector is projected to grow by an annual
     average of 9.8 percent, driven by the expected growth in construction, oil-related
     infrastructure, electricity and water. The services sector is also expected to grow
     at an annual average of 8.5 percent, driven mainly by tourism, wholesale and
     retail trade as well as finance.
7.   Until recently, monetary policy has been tight and aimed at unwinding the high
     monetary growth and the associated inflationary pressures on the economy.
     Following the subdued inflationary pressures, in late 2009, monetary policy has
     since eased, lending support to the economic growth process. As a result, broad
     money supply, including foreign currency deposit (M2+) grew by 41.9 percent
     year-on-year compared with growths of 28.0 percent and 33.8 percent in
     September and December 2010, respectively.
8.   The policy rate which stood at 18 percent in December 2009 has been lowered
     progressively to 13.5 percent in July 2010 and 12.5 percent in July 2011 and has
     since remained at this level.
9.   The downward trends in the monetary policy rate subsequently triggered
     declining interest rates on the money market. The rates on Treasury Bill
     instruments, namely the 91-day and the 182-day bills dropped, respectively, from
     12.3 percent and 12.7 percent to 9.4 percent and 10.1 percent in September 2011.
     The rates on 1-year, 2-year and 3-year fixed notes similarly dropped from 12.7
     percent, 12.7 percent and 13.3 percent to 11.2 percent, 11.9 percent and 13.0
     percent, respectively, during the first nine months of 2011. The resulting yield
     curve, therefore, showed an upward slope which is an improvement over the
     inverted yield curve a year ago


                                      - 51 -
10.   The rate of inflation recorded in December 2010 was 8.6 percent. This increased
      marginally to 9.1 percent and 9.2 percent in January and February 2011,
      respectively, due mainly to the fuel price increase announced at the beginning of
      the year and the depreciation of the cedi during the first two months of the year.
11.   After the full effect of the petroleum price hike had been absorbed, inflation
      resumed its downward trend in March 2011, declining to 8.4 percent in September
      2011. The downward trend in inflation has largely been the result of a fall in both
      food and non-food prices.
12.   The cedi depreciated strongly against the major currencies in first half of 2009 on
      account of the depletion of foreign reserves, and uncertainties in the domestic and
      global financial markets. As the macroeconomic stabilization measures took
      effect in the second half of 2009, the cedi gained in strength. During the nine
      month period of 2011, the exchange rate of the cedi against the US dollar, pound
      sterling and the euro had appreciated by 6.2 percent, 7.9 percent and 8.7 percent,
      respectively.
13.   Fiscal stability was seriously strained in 2008, caused largely by the expansionary
      fiscal stance of the Government leading to worsening of the budget deficit, which
      reached 8.5 percent of GDP on cash basis in 2008. As a result of Government’s
      commitments to fiscal consolidation, the overall budget deficit has been brought
      down to 2.0 percent of GDP by end September 2011. Net domestic financing
      (NDF) also declined from 5.7 percent in 2008 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2009. The
      fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2011, and over the
      medium term to 3.3 percent of GDP, on account of improved expenditure
      management and enhanced revenue mobilization.
Medium Term Economic Policies
14.   The strategic direction of the Government in the medium-term is to lay the
      foundation for the structural transformation of the economy. This will be achieved
      through industrialization especially manufacturing, based on modernized
      agriculture and sustainable exploitation of Ghana’s natural resources, particularly
      minerals, oil and gas. The process will be underpinned by rapid infrastructural and
      human development as well as the application of science, technology and
      innovation.
15.   In this regard, Government expenditure is being prioritized in favour of policies,
      programmes and projects in the following areas: agriculture, infrastructure, water
      and sanitation, health and education. The strategy also entails improved enabling
      environment to support the private sector; active government interventions where
      appropriate; transparent and accountable governance and efficiency in public
      service delivery at all levels; and effective decentralization for enhanced local
      economic development.
16.   In 2012 and the medium term, Government’s macroeconomic policy agenda will
      focus on three complementary objectives:
         preserving the gains of macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal consolidation
          achieved since 2009;


                                       - 52 -
         making fiscal space for high-priority investments to spur long-term growth
          and development; and
         maintaining inflation in single digits.
17.   To achieve these objectives, the Government is committed to keeping fiscal
      deficits at levels that can be prudently financed, while accelerating efforts to fill
      the country’s large infrastructure gaps, consistent with the GSGDA. In the light of
      our middle-income status and prospects of declining access to concessional
      financing, the Government is securing a US$3 billion Master Facility Agreement
      (MFA) on non-concessional but very competitive terms with the China
      Development Bank. The funds will be used to finance critical infrastructure
      investments, including a gas pipeline that is urgently needed to avoid the
      significant risks to existing oil wells and also possible flaring of gas.


MACROECONOMIC TARGETS AND MEASURES FOR 2012
18.   The macroeconomic outlook for 2012 is positive. External demand for Ghana’s
      exports is expected to remain strong, with oil production volumes projected to rise
      further, while sizeable infrastructure investments and strong private demand is
      expected to support broad-based economic activity. The overall economy is
      projected to grow by more than 8 per cent, with the inflation rate remaining
      broadly stable at the upper single digit range.
19.   The details of the macroeconomic targets for 2012 are as follows:
         Real non-oil GDP growth of 7.6 percent;
         Real overall GDP growth of 9.4 percent;
         Average inflation of 8.7 percent;
         End-period inflation of 8.5 percent;
         Overall budget deficit equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP; and
         Gross international reserves of not less than three months of import cover for
          goods and services.
20.   In 2012 and the medium term, the strategic direction of Government would be to
      consolidate macroeconomic stability to lay the foundation for the structural
      transformation of the economy. The key priority for the Government will be the
      continuation of prudent fiscal policies, while scaling up investment in
      infrastructure. This will be achieved through: (i) continued mobilization of
      revenues through tax administration and policy measures; (ii) managing the wage
      bill implications of the implementation of the single spine pay policy; and (iii)
      controlling other recurrent expenditures. Prudent wage management and various
      measures on the revenue and expenditure side will ensure that the fiscal stance in
      2012 and beyond remains consistent with medium- and long-term debt
      sustainability.




                                        - 53 -
21.   The Government is committed to continuing the fiscal consolidation that it began
      in 2009 by further reducing the fiscal deficit from the projected 4.8 percent in
      2011 to 3.5 percent in 2013.
Agricultural Modernization
22.   Agriculture is Ghana’s greatest strength and will remain so in spite of the recent
      discovery of oil in commercial quantities. The Government remains committed to
      developing the agricultural sector with the oil and gas sector serving as a linkage
      with other sectors of the economy to generate resources that can be used for rapid
      development of national infrastructure. The linkage will increase agricultural
      productivity and by extension increased industrial value- added production,
      accelerating job creation and facilitating the building of national capacity to
      harness advanced technologies.
23.   Government’s agriculture development strategy for 2012 and the medium term is
      based on the knowledge that agriculture has significant potential to grow beyond
      the levels experienced in recent years. High agriculture growth can only
      materialize through modernization and diversification, driven by public-private
      investment and increase in productivity. In this regard, the Government is focused
      on accelerating the modernization of agriculture to transform the economy
      through the continuous introduction of technology namely fertilizer, improved
      seeds and agricultural mechanization, among others. The results would be
      increased production, incomes and export earnings, food security and supply of
      raw materials for value addition and rural development
24.   In 2012 and the medium term, government will continue to implement
      programmes and projects outlined in the Medium Term Agricultural Sector
      Investment Plan (METASIP). The plan aims at leading the growth and structural
      transformation of the economy to maximize the benefits of accelerated growth. As
      part of efforts to increase agricultural productivity, government will expand the
      Agriculture Subsidy Programme to include liquid fertilizers (bio-fertilizer) and
      improved seeds and pursue the Block Farm Programme, with a target of
      60,000hectars for the production of maize, cassava, rice, yam, sorghum and
      cowpea by 100,000 farmers under the METASIP
Private Sector Competitiveness
25.   The GSGDA seeks to address the structural constraints at the policy and
      institutional levels that hamper private sector competitiveness. Government’s
      agenda in 2012 and the medium term is to continue the implementation of the
      Second Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS II), with emphasis on the
      development of a competitive and thriving private sector that will create jobs and
      enhance livelihoods.
26.   Government will continue with initiatives to enhance competences and capacity at
      the firm level. This will include the provision of business support and training,
      extension of micro-credit, venture capital and export credit facilities to businesses.
      Additionally, government has launched an industrial policy which will focus




                                        - 54 -
      amongst others the development of small, medium and micro-enterprises that
      would ensure that Ghanaian entrepreneurs perform to the best of their abilities.


SUSTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE
Public Financial Management
27.   The main strategies Government would use to sustain budgetary discipline
      include controlling expenditures, generating more revenue and efficiency gains,
      better budget planning, and providing an enabling environment for transparency
      and accountability. It is hoped that this will enhance the efficiency,
      comprehensiveness, and transparency of revenue administration in the medium
      term.
28.   As part of its resolve to strengthen fiscal management, Government will continue
      to build a strong foundation towards achieving aggregate fiscal discipline
      anchored on positive developments in the following areas: (i) relatively low levels
      of extra-budgetary expenditures, (ii) good and timely public access to key fiscal
      information, (iii) adherence to a fixed and coherent budget calendar, (iv) high
      average debt collection ratios for tax arrears and (v) regular and timely revenue
      transfers to the Consolidated Fund among others.
29.   The integration of the Revenue Agencies under an umbrella entity; the Ghana
      Revenue Authority (GRA), the strategy to strengthen the Large Taxpayer Unit
      (LTU), and the separation of taxpayers amongst large, medium, and small tax
      offices, are key steps within the policy framework aimed at improving revenue
      administration
30.   Other measures include the setting up of the Transit Monitoring Unit by the
      Custom Division of the GRA to prevent the diversion of transit goods back into
      the country. Revenue administration within the IRS Division of the GRA has also
      been improved to include the introduction of computerized systems and
      expanding the special tax audit of companies to cover some medium and small
      scale businesses in the informal sector.
31.   In 2012, the Government will introduce the Ghana Integrated Cargo Clearance
      System (GICCS) to track and account for containers and consignments arriving at
      the ports. Risk management will be improved by targeting revenue risk
      consignments for examination based on profiling.
32.   To improve its capacity for budget monitoring and control, the Government took
      concrete steps to implement of the Ghana Integrated Financial Management
      Information System (GIFMIS) over the period FY 2010-14. To this end, the
      Government, approved a Public Financial Management Improvement Charter,
      called the GIFMIS Charter in 2009. The charter calls for the re-invigoration of a
      country-wide budget management system that is premised on the need to capture
      all public finances at the center and across all local governments, under a single,
      unified chart of accounts and budget classification, among others.




                                       - 55 -
33.   A Treasury Single Account (TSA) has also been established at the Central Bank.
      The objective is to enhance expenditure control by ensuring that all Ministries
      Departments and Agencies (MDAs’) cash balances are known at all times, as well
      as to save on short term financial charges by managing liquidity better. By doing
      so, budget deviations are expected to be reduced, through improved in-time
      monitoring of the Government’s cash balance. This will allow for improved
      predictability of resource flows to service delivery agencies and support better
      commitment management and control. The effective linkage of MDAs’ bank
      accounts to the TSA and the facilitation training of public servants commenced in
      2010 and is still ongoing.
34.   Government has established a basic operational process for an efficient cash
      management system in the Consolidated Fund. In 2012, when the transition to the
      GIFMIS is completed, the full implementation of the monthly cash management
      system would begin. This will be anchored on the Treasury Single Account
      mechanism; (i) to enhance the predictability of expenditure commitments across
      MDAs’; (ii) assist to reliably account for and reduce the potential for building up
      a stock of expenditure arrears; and (iii) reduce Government financial charges and
      short term borrowing costs.
35.   A harmonized chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting and reporting for all
      MDAs’ has also been developed and approved. This will ensure that reporting of
      budget implementation is consistent with the budget itself; (i) ensure the
      comprehensiveness of reporting on Government’s fiscal position; (ii) enable the
      aggregation and disaggregation of expenditures in the budget across the various
      arms of government; and (iii) enable the functional and economic classifications
      needed for proper expenditure review.
36.   To be able to check the consistency of MDAs’ commitments with their cash
      plans, Government has established a basic process of compiling claims and
      outstanding payment system. As a result, Ministry of Finance and Economic
      Planning (MoFEP) is now able to make high-level checks on the consistency of
      MDAs’ commitments with their cash plans, and thus contain the potential for
      accumulation of projects arrears. To support this process, Government has
      developed a contract database which allows ready flow of information relating to
      expenditure commitment and other obligations in order to reduce the potentials
      for accumulation of project arrears. The Government has also reinstated and
      enforced commitment controls for all MDAs’.
Financial Sector Reform
37.   Ghana’s financial sector has undergone extensive reforms over the last two
      decades to deepen and broaden financial intermediation in the country. In-spite of
      the wide reforms, there still remained some significant weaknesses within the
      sector. To address these weaknesses, the Government in 2003 developed the first
      phase of the Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSP) which was implemented
      from FY 2003 through FY 2008. The impact assessment that was commission
      upon at the end of the program contained 98 recommendations for reforming and




                                       - 56 -
      strengthening the financial sector. As at the end of 2008, an estimated 80% of the
      recommendations of FINSSP I had been implemented.
38.   Going forward, Government has committed to further strengthening the
      regulatory and supervisory regime in the financial sector. Qualitative issues such
      as the approach to risk management, accounting standards, and general corporate
      governance all require attention, as does strengthening the underlying system for
      asset recovery and insolvency. The second Financial Sector Strategic Plan
      (FINSSPII) will be implemented to address these issues. The Ministry of
      Finance & Economic Planning, has developed and submitted to Cabinet for
      approval the Second Financial Sector Strategic Plan, FINSSP II.
39.   The FINSSP II draws from lessons-learned from the FINSSP I. The vision and
      key objectives for FINSSP II are consistent with its predecessor. There is a
      significantly stronger emphasis on consolidating the gains of previous reform
      actions, strengthening Ghana’s regulatory institutions, and building confidence in
      the system. Along with measures envisaged to reduce arrears and flows, the
      implementation of the FINSSP II is expected to reduce the proportion of Non
      Performing Loans (NPL) (through improved risk management) as well as to
      maintain satisfactory capital adequacy ratios in the banking sector.


PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE ENERGY
SECTOR
Public Sector Reform
40.   The Government has adopted a new approach to public sector reform based on
      lessons learned from over two decades of such initiatives in the country. The new
      reform process is a sector-driven approach geared towards having sector Ministers
      assuming primary responsibility for tapping into resources for reforming various
      public sector areas as well as specific sector programmes.
41.   The Government continued with the phased implementation of the Single Spine
      Salary Structure (SSSS). The objective of the Single Spine Salary Structure is to
      address disparities, distortions and restore equity in the pay structure by placing
      all public sector employees on a vertical structure and ensuring that jobs with the
      same weight are paid within the same pay range. Implementation of the SSSS
      started in July 2010 through an incremental approach, and is on course. By
      September 2011, about 69 percent made up of 44 institutions had been migrated
      on to the SSSS. The Government has planned to migrate the remainder by end-
      2011. The expected decompression of wages under the SSSS through increased
      relativities has been postponed to the final years of implementation.
42.   Oversight and management of Subvented Agencies (SAs) in the country remains
      a challenge. The Government has realized the need to clarify the mandates of the
      agencies and also ensuring better control over their payroll. In furtherance of this,
      the Government has reviewed the mandates and classified Subvented Agencies
      according to their relevance with respect to the GSGDA. This review formed the
      basis for the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, and the Public


                                       - 57 -
      Sector Reform Secretariat, to develop and submits to Cabinet for decision
      and announcement the action plan on Subvented Agency Reform (i.e.
      decisions on those for closure, withdrawal of subvention, those on reduced
      subvention and timelines for implementation).
43.   The migration of SAs onto the integrated payroll system is central to the
      Government’s agenda of eliminating waste and improving the efficiency in the
      use of public resources. The plan foresees a two-stage approach to SAs reform.
      During the first stage, 15 SAs will be put on performance contracts for a period of
      three years. The second stage will gradually extend the reform to all SAs through
      the performance management and development systems. Annual evaluations of
      the performance of agencies will be conducted and corrective measures adopted
      when necessary. Meanwhile, the Government has completed four pilot processes
      of voluntary redundancy in the Ghana Standards Board, the Ghana National
      Procurement Agency, the Ghana International Trade Fair Authority and the
      Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service. The management of
      these pilots has provided useful lessons to guide future voluntary severance
      packages.
44.   Decentralization in Ghana is entrenched in the Constitution of Ghana (Article
      242) and is defined as devolution of considerable responsibilities to local
      governments for ensuring a fair distribution of resources, as well as to enhance the
      quality of public service delivery. This is believed to be a key policy instrument to
      reduce Regional inequalities and poverty in Ghana. The Government is
      committed to the Decentralization Agenda. To this end, the Government has
      concluded a nation-wide consultation process under the direction of the Ministry
      of Local Government & Rural Development to collate views from stakeholders in
      all Regional Capitals. In addition, consultations have been held with the
      Parliamentary Committees on Local Government, Think Tanks, Civil Society
      Groups and Traditional Authorities.
45.   The Government, has finalized a Comprehensive Decentralization Policy
      following the consultations, and submitted it to Cabinet for decision. The plan
      details a series of activities to be undertaken over four years to implement the
      policy framework.
46.   High on the agenda is the devolution of basic service functions to Local
      Governments Metropolitan and Municipal District Assemblies, (MMDAs) and the
      operationalization of the devolved functions of the Local Government Service.
      Already, 32,358 staff have been transferred from the Civil Service to the Local
      Government Service to improve the Local Government Administration.
      Following the transfer, a Human Resource and Physical Infrastructure Auditing to
      ascertain the actual status of the MMDAs was conducted to inform policy
      formulation and planning.
Energy
47.   Structural changes in the energy sector has contributed significantly to macro-
      economic stabilization. Subsidies to the energy sector for below-cost recovery
      tariffs and commercial losses absorbed almost 3 percent of GDP in 2008. It is in


                                       - 58 -
         this context that the Government implemented recommendations of the Electricity
         Financial Recovery Plan approved by Cabinet in 2009.The objective of the plan
         was to: (i) restore financial viability to the three power utilities, (ii) improve their
         commercial and operational performance and (iii) put an end to their dependence
         on the state budget.
48.      Accordingly, electricity tariffs were revised upwards in June 2010, except for
         small consumers. In addition, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority
         (PURC) established and implemented an automatic electricity tariff
         adjustment mechanism, with a view to avoiding large and difficult tariff
         adjustments, while providing greater financial predictability to utility companies.
49.      The Government has started to address major contingent liabilities in the
         Petroleum Products Distribution Sector. The Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) and the
         Bulk Oil Storage and Transport Co. Ltd (BOST) built up substantial short-term
         debts in both local and foreign currency for crude oil suppliers in 2008. These
         debts, arising from past under-recovery of rising oil costs impaired the ability of
         the institutions to finance their operations. In response, Government made two
         financial injections in TOR’s capital in March 2010 and March 2011, which
         allowed the refinery to settle its debt to Ghana Commercial Bank, and partially
         restore its capacity to operate.
50.      In January 2011 the Government introduced a series of measures to deal with the
         TOR debt. They included a 30 percent increase in the regulated price of petroleum
         products to reduce the potential scope for under-recovery of costs by TOR, and
         levy to finance TOR-related bonds debt service. Consequently, the Ministries of
         Energy, and Finance and Economic Planning, has submitted to Cabinet for
         approval an action plan regarding the restoration of Tema Oil Refinery
         financial sustainability. The plan, foresees the conduction of financial,
         operational and management audits which will be completed in 2012.
Human Development, Productivity and Employment
51.      Human development continues to be the underlying priority of Ghana’s
         development agenda. The GSGDA has emphasised that, the main aim of human
         resource development to ensure the development of knowledgeable well trained
         and disciplined labour force. This is expected to transform the key sectors of the
         economy and supports the efforts to raise living standards and productivity as the
         basis of wealth creation and the optimization of the potential of the economy. The
         agenda addresses issues in: (i) the education sector; (ii) human resource
         development, (iii) productivity and employment; (iv) health promotion including
         HIV/AIDS and STDs; (v) population management, including migration and
         development; (vi) youth and sports development; (vii) poverty reduction and
         social protection.
Health
52.      The health status of Ghanaians has improved over the years. In 2009, the holistic
         assessment of the Health Sector showed overall satisfactory performance. Such a
         performance compared to the last two Demographic and Health Surveys



                                            - 59 -
      conducted in 2003 and 2008. Progress achieved over this period is impressive:
      under-5 children mortality has reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, the
      proportion of malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 percent to 14
      percent, and the proportion of medically assisted deliveries went up from 47
      percent to 59 percent. HIV prevalence also declined from 2.7 percent to 2.2
      percent of the population between 2005 and 2008. Health progress continued to
      increase in coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS),
      reaching 16.9 million people by end 2010 representing about 70 percent of the
      population.
53.   These successes notwithstanding, there are persistent policy-related issues that
      need to be addressed to meet equity gaps in access to health and other targets
      outlined in the GSGDA and to meet the MDG targets on health. The key policy
      initiatives to be used include bridging gaps in access to health care and nutrition
      services; improving governance and strengthening efficiency in health service
      delivery; improving governance and strengthening efficiency in health service
      delivery; improving access to quality maternal and child health services;
      intensifying prevention and control of non-communicable and communicable
      diseases such as malaria, HIV and AIDS and strengthening mental health
      delivery.
Education
54.   In line with the Education Sector Development Strategy adopted in 2003, progress
      in terms of access to primary education has been significant. Gross primary
      enrolment rates went up from 86 percent to 95 percent between 2003/4 and
      2008/9, while net primary enrolment rates went up from 56 percent to 84 percent
      over the same period. Over the years, increased efforts at building new schools in
      deprived Districts, and increased attention to gender parity, have allowed for an
      extension of progress in access to primary education by vulnerable populations.
      The demand side was supported with the initiation of a School Feeding Program
      in the poor Regions, and the development of conditional cash transfers under the
      LEAP program.
55.   The Government recognizes that it needs to do more to improve access, financing
      and the provision of infrastructure facilities at all levels. it also recognises that
      education quality issues remain a matter of national concern. In responding to
      these sector challenges, a number of strategies have been proposed to promote the
      achievement of poverty reduction, facilitate the attainment of the Education For
      All (EFA) goals.
56.   The key policy interventions include increase in equity, access and participation
      in quality education at all levels; improve quality of teaching and learning;
      bridging gender gaps in access to education; improve access to quality education
      for persons with disability and promote science and technical education at all
      levels. The Government, also, emphasizes its commitment to stimulate skills and
      technology based development in key economic sectors through demand driven
      improvements in quality of formal and informal training, development and
      adoption of new technologies.

Social Protection
57.    The Government continues to implement measures to strengthen the existing
       Social Protection Mechanisms. These measures are outlined in the National
       Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) which was published in March 2007. The
       strategy seeks to protect of persons living in situations of extreme poverty,
       vulnerability and exclusion from both expected and unexpected threats to their
       livelihoods. In 2010, the Government established the multi-sectoral National
       Social Protection Steering Committee, with a view to developing effective
       coordination across relevant MDAs and promoting a common approach to
       targeting.
58.    In 2010, the Government embarked on the assignment of institutional
       responsibilities, budget, detail objectives, action plan and timeline for the
       adoption and use of a common targeting mechanism for the Livelihood
       Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), National Health Insurance Scheme
       (NHIS) and School Uniform Programme. Interventions, based on Proxy Means
       Test (PMT), is foreseen as a decisive step towards a common approach including
       a national single register. Subsequently, the Ministry of Employment and Social
       Welfare, has pre-tested and validated the common targeting mechanism, in
       collaboration with the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Education, Local
       Government & Rural Development, for application to LEAP, NHIS indigent
       and School Uniform Programs in pilot areas. In 2011 the Government also started
       a review of the National Social Protection strategy with a view to making it more
       focused on the poor.


DEVELOPING THE OIL AND GAS INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
Regulatory Framework
59.    Following the confirmation of substantial oil and gas reserves in several offshore
       fields, Government has been moving forward on several fronts to enable these
       resources to be exploited in an economically rational manner, while ensuring that
       the impacts of the new oil and gas industry will be handled in an environmentally
       and socially sensitive manner. The Government is cognisant of the poor track
       record of other low-income oil producing countries and also of the high
       expectations of the electorate that these national resources be exploited in a
       transparent manner for the general good of the nation.
60.    Actual production from January to September 2011 was 17.42 million barrels. It
       is expected that the year 2011 will close with an annual oil production of 24.78
       million barrels. Total oil receipts for the 2012 fiscal year is projected at
       GH₵1,239.82 million based on an estimated average oil price of US$90.00 per
       barrel and daily oil production of 90,000 barrels per day.
61.    Gas in the oil fields is currently being partly re-injected or flared. Following the
       recommendations of a Presidential Task Force, the Government has now formed
       the Ghana National Gas Company to construct a pipeline and processing
       infrastructure needed to commercialize the associated gas. A portion of the US$3


                                        - 61 -
      billion infrastructure loan from the China Development Bank is earmarked to
      finance these projects. Although the Government sees the first gas infrastructure
      projects as being entirely publicly owned, subsequent projects may be carried out
      by means of joint ventures with private investors.
62.   With this in mind, the Government intends to adopt a gas commercialization and
      pricing policy in 2012 to provide predictability, transparency and incentives
      needed for private participation, particularly for the development of non-
      associated gas fields where there is no oil to carry the burden of initial field
      development costs.
63.   In April 2011, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2011, (Act 815) was
      passed by Parliament and assented by the President. Benefiting from extensive
      public consultations, the Act provides a strong framework for the: (i) collection
      and management of oil and gas revenue, (ii) establishing a clear system of
      controls for the collection of oil revenues and their allocation to the budget and
      the proposed stabilization and heritage funds, (iii) a clear division of
      responsibilities among authorities, (iv) reasonable rules for managing the
      investments of the funds, and (v) strong oversight and transparency provisions.
64.   The Act retains, inter alia, the principles that all petroleum revenue from upstream
      and midstream activities will be collected in a single account at the Bank of
      Ghana (BoG) and will be accounted for in the budget; that the maximum annual
      budget funding amount will be determined by law based on a pre-identified
      benchmark revenue; and that once in the budget, petroleum income will be treated
      just as the same as any other government income. The Act also foresees the
      establishment of a Stabilization Fund and a Heritage Fund, both to be governed by
      law, and overseen by the Parliament.
65.   Transparency and accountability provisions in the Petroleum Revenue
      Management Act are complemented with the extension of EITI principles to the
      oil and gas sectors. In 2010, The Government approved a revised Ghana
      Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GHEITI) institutional framework
      including the oil and gas sectors. The revised framework should improve
      transparency and accountability on payments made by oil companies to
      Government and revenues the Government receives from oil companies through
      independent auditing. Moving forward, the Government intends to ensure the
      EITI framework becomes legally binding.
66.   Government efforts in the sector now focus on developing a regulatory
      framework to encourage sound and sustainable development of the oil and gas
      industry. Following from extensive public consultations, government embarked
      on a plan to enact the necessary regulatory framework. The Ministry of Energy,
      has submitted to Cabinet for decision a policy proposal establishing a
      Petroleum Regulatory Authority. The proposal, which was subjected to broad
      and meaningful public consultations with stakeholders, was adopted and the
      Petroleum Commission established.
67.   The policy and the relevant regulatory framework for effective co-ordination and
      improvement of the Mining Sector would be enhanced. In the medium-term


                                       - 62 -
      government will strengthen and enforce the existing environmental laws and
      regulations. The formulation of a National Mining Policy would be accelerated
      and the Minerals Development Fund would be reviewed to address concerns of
      Communities, Chiefs and District Assemblies on the royalty allocations.
Aid Policy
68.   Despite efforts towards better aid coordination and dialogue a number of
      challenges still remain. These continue to limit the efficiency and effectiveness
      with which aid is delivered, and weaken Ghana’s case for the scaling-up of aid in
      the short to medium term. These challenges include: (i) difficulties in
      operationalising development priorities and aligning aid; (ii) the limited use of
      country systems in aid delivery; (iii) fragmentation in sourcing and managing aid;
      (iv) high transaction costs and inadequate capacity in aid delivery; and, (v)
      insufficient coordination among stakeholders among others.
69.   The Government of Ghana endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in
      2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action in 2008. In addition Ghana will endorse
      the November- December 2011 Busan outcome document for Effective
      Development Co-Operation. A Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy was developed in
      response to strong evidence that recipient countries policies and procedures,
      human capacity, economic management and institutional arrangements determine
      to a large extent the optimal allocation of aid and hence its impact on growth and
      poverty reduction. The Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy which is at Cabinet level,
      provides a coherent and consolidated framework for Government and its Partners
      on aid coordination and institutional arrangements to achieve development results.
      The document will guide Ghana’s future mobilization and management of
      development assistance in consonance with the principles of the Paris
      Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action; and now the Busan Partnership Principles
      for Effective Development Cooperation.
70.   Ghana, intends to draw up and implement a country-level action plan to guide the
      entire post Busan Development Effectiveness Agenda. It is envisaged that all
      other relevant interventions such as the various reforms in the country systems
      agenda, will be anchored on this action plan. Although, a long-term process, the
      government is committed to this, as it would ensure positive implications for our
      development.


CONCLUSION
71.   Mr. President, for the short time that the NDC Government has been in office, it
      has taken appropriate measures to enhance fiscal discipline and stabilized the
      economy in pursuit of the country’s development agenda. We believe that with
      continued support from the World Bank and other development partners, Ghana
      will be able to achieve the objectives set out in the Ghana Shared Growth and
      Development Agenda, 2010-2013. The Grant has a tall order of reducing maternal
      mortality, eliminating extreme poverty, ensuring sustainable poverty reduction as

      well as creating the conditions necessary for prosperity in our country. The
      PRSG-8 support will greatly facilitate the achievement of these goals.
72.   We thank you for supporting our fledgling democracy and it is our hope that
      Ghana will continue to be a beacon of hope in Sub-Saharan Africa.

            Annex 5: Framework Memorandum between the Government of Ghana and
                                  Development Partners

                     MULTI-DONOR BUDGETARY SUPPORT PROGRAMME
                                     19 May, 2008

1. PREAMBLE


1.1. This Framework Memorandum (FM) describes the common framework for the
implementation of grant and loan agreements through the Multi-Donor Budget Support
Programme (MDBS) to support the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11)49. This
FM replaces the previous one between the Government of Ghana (GoG) and Development
Partners (DPs) signed in Accra on 30 June 2003.

1.2. This FM will be supplemented by individual arrangements between each
individual DP and the GoG. The contents in the individual funding arrangements take
precedence over this FM. However, DPs will establish funding arrangements that are
compatible with the spirit and provision of this FM.

1.3.  This FM does not constitute an international treaty and is not intended to create legal
commitments.

1.4.    Amendments to this FM can be made by way of an exchange of letters in terms accepted
by all DPs involved in the MDBS and the GoG.

1.5. When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to follow international
recommendations and best practices as regards budget support.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1. The GoG and DPs consider the FM for MDBS as the common basis for support to the
implementation of GPRS II through the GoG's budget.

2.2. MDBS is open to other DPs who might wish to participate. The decision to
participate does not imply that all participating DPs will be providing resources in any given
year. However, it does imply that the spirit of this arrangement will be respected. MDBS
currently includes the African Development Bank, Canada, Denmark, the European
Commission, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the
World Bank.

2.3.       The objectives of MDBS are:

          to provide additional and more predictable budgetary resources to implement GPRS II
           and finance fiscal actions aimed at reducing poverty, reaching the Millennium
49
     Our subsequent national Poverty Reduction Strategies


                                                     - 81 -
       Development Goals (MDGs) and promoting growth;
      to increase aid effectiveness by harmonising DPs' policies and procedures, by
       minimising transaction costs and by fostering ownership, alignment, management for
       results and mutual accountability;
      to enhance the performance and accountability of the GoG's public financial
       management (PFM) systems;
      to facilitate the strengthening of institutional capacity for designing and executing
       development policies;
      to promote an accelerated implementation of policy reforms and an enhanced
       performance in service delivery in order to reach development objectives;
      to foster domestic accountability and transparency.


3. UNDERLING PRINCIPLE


3.1.    The GoG and DPs, to the extent compatible with their statutory mandates, consider
the following to be the underlying principles of MDBS for this FM:

      Continuing sound macroeconomic policies and management;
      Commitment to achieving the GPRS II objectives and MDGs;
      Sound budgeting and PFM systems;
      Continuing peace and respect for human rights, the rule of law, democratic
       principles, and the independence of the judiciary;
      Good governance, accountability of the GoG to the citizenry, and integrity in public
       life, including the active fight against corruption;
      Observance of the underlying principles is considered critical for the implementation of
       this FM.

4. PROGRESS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

4.1    A set of growth and poverty reduction objectives, development indicators and policy
reform measures, drawn from the GPRS II, is mutually accepted by GoG and DPs as the Progress
Assessment Framework (PAF) and will be used by all signatories of this FM.

4.2    These development indicators and policy reform measures are referred to in this
document as 'targets'. Targets will be result-oriented, time-bound, specific, measurable, realistic,
within the power of the GoG to achieve, and limited in number. The GoG and DPs will decide
on the means of verification of the targets, including the necessary documentation. The
achievement of a subset of the targets, hereafter called “triggers?, will determine the extent to
which the single component or the performance component is disbursed (see chapter 6).



                                             - 82 -
4.3     DPs and GoG operate a multi-annual rolling PAF. The PAF is named by the year in
which policy actions or indicators that are subject to assessment in the subsequent year are
referring to. For example, if policy actions or indicators are to be taken or achieved in 'Yearn',
the PAF will be called 'PAF n'. PAF targets for the outer years will be indicative.

4.4    DPs and GoG will endeavour to ensure complementarity and coordination between
MDBS and sector budget support arrangements. While recognizing that these constitute distinct
processes, the arrangements should be seen as mutually supportive. The MDBS policy
dialogue will add value to and will be informed by policy dialogues at the sector level,
including major policy objectives and issues of crosscutting nature or with significant
macroeconomic and budgetary implications.

5. DIALOGUE AND REVIEW PROCESS

5.1. The signatories have committed to coordinate reporting, dialogue and review missions.
Regular dialogue among the signatories to the FM is essential for continued commitment to the
MDBS.

5.2. The review process for MDBS will be common for all DPs. Participants will meet on a
decided schedule, aligned with the review process of the GPRS II and the budget cycle. The
review will be organised and chaired by the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning
(MOFEP), and include representatives of the GoG and the MDBS partners (including
observers). Representatives from Parliament may be invited by the GoG to participate or
observe the review.

5.3. The review process will be guided by the work of sector groups, including the
conclusions from existing sector-level reviews. It will use information gathered through these
and other ongoing processes to ensure that DPs do not set up duplicative reviews. It will
endeavour to minimise additional work.

5.4.   The review will include an assessment of overall progress in implementing the GPRS II,
including macroeconomic performance, as well as progress against the PAF.

5.5. The overall progress in implementing the GPRS II will be assessed on the basis of the
Annual Progress Report and other existing central documents. The assessment of
satisfactory macroeconomic performance will be guided by an IMF instrument or
arrangement. If the GoG is broadly on track in both areas, this 'holistic assessment' will be
considered to be positive.

5.6. In addition, the documentation for the review will include, amongst others, regular
reports on budget execution and poverty-reducing expenditures; existing PFM reviews,
including a selected-flows audit; the annual budget statement, and the agreed
documentary evidence for progress achieved in the PAF.

5.7. In order to ensure a fully informed review, the GoG will submit any outstanding
documentation to DPs prior to the review.

5.8.   The GoG and DPs endeavour to have joint and regular communication with external


                                            - 83 -
stakeholders at key stages in the MDBS dialogue, including dissemination of the final PAF and
outcomes of the annual review.

6.     DISBURSEMENT MECHANISM

6.1. The DPs' contribution consists of either a single component or two components (a
base and a performance component) each year. Decisions on the number of components and
the ratio between components will be left to the discretion of each DP.

6.2. The decision on the disbursement of the base component will be based on a positive
holistic assessment (see paragraph 5.4). Neither the base nor the performance component will be
disbursed if the holistic assessment is deemed unsatisfactory.

6.3. Progress against the triggers will determine the extent to which the single component
or the performance component is disbursed. When reviewing progress against the triggers,
DPs may take account of the extent to which the trigger was achieved, the GoG's effort to
achieve the trigger, any developments outside the control of the GoG that may have affected
progress, and other key developments in the sector.

6.4. Disbursement decisions will be left to the discretion of each individual DP; however,
DPs will try to reach a joint position.

6.5. In order to increase predictability and alignment with the budget cycle, DPs commit
to give the GoG advance notice of the indicative MDBS funding for the following year, the
amount of which will be announced directly following the completion of the respective PAF
assessment and in time to inform the GoG's formulation of the following year's budget. At the
same time, DPs commit to provide GoG with planned figures for their disbursements in the
outer years. The disbursement of both components will ideally be made in the first four
months of the following fiscal year.

6.6. Installments will be deposited in a convertible foreign exchange account (the MDBS
Account) in the name of the Government held at the Bank of Ghana. Within 48 hours, the Bank
of Ghana will credit the Ghana Cedi equivalent (using the Central Bank (buying) exchange
rate on the date of 'purchase') to the Central Treasury Account for use as budget revenue.

6.7. The Bank of Ghana will provide documentary evidence of the amount and date of the
foreign exchange payment to the respective DP and the Ministry of Finance & Economic
Planning (MOFEP). MOFEP will acknowledge the amount and date of receipt of the Cedi
equivalent in its Central Treasury Account, in writing, to the respective DP and to the co-chairs
of the MDBS group.

7.     AUDIT

7.1.   The following audit arrangements will be established:

      The Ghana Audit Service (GAS) carries out an independent annual external audit of
       the GoG Accounts. The annual audit report by the GAS should be provided to MDBS DPs
       as soon as it becomes available.


                                           - 84 -
      Further exercises will be carried out to complement GAS' annual audit. These include
       public expenditure tracking surveys, performance audits and GAS audit of selected
       flows (with regards to the latter, MDBS development partners will continue to make
       funding available for the purpose of the annual audit of selected flows which must be
       carried out to international standards). To the extent possible, the timing and content of
       these exercises will be coordinated.

7.2.   The Audit Reports will be discussed as part of the MDBS dialogue

8.     PROCUREMENT

8.1.    The GoG will perform all procurement in accordance with national procurement rules,
guidelines and procedures.

9.     RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOG

9.1. The GoG, in accordance with its rules, regulations, policies, and procedures, and
subject to the availability of funds, will:

      Respect the underlying principles of this FM.
      Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system that is used to assess progress on the
       implementation of the GPRS II.
      Implement the GPRS II and ensure that total expenditure and sector allocations
       effectively reflect the GoG's growth and poverty reduction commitment and that the
       budget is comprehensive.
      Further strengthen PFM systems and processes, including procurement and the
       Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and continue efforts to tackle
       corruption.

10     RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DPS

10.1. To the extent possible and consistent with their internal laws, policies, procedures and
individual bilateral agreements with the GoG, DPs will:

      Improve aid effectiveness, including the facilitation of greater GoG ownership,
       harmonisation, alignment, result-orientation and mutual accountability.
      Coordinate the timing of their disbursements with the GoG's budgetary requirements.
      Work closely with the GoG to coordinate with other dialogue mechanisms and aid
       modalities.


10.2. The DPs will endeavour to follow the principles and procedures enshrined in the FM and
reflect them in their bilateral funding arrangements with GoG to the maximum extent. These
arrangements will mainly provide further details on the obligations of each participant and
the procedures for disbursing funds together with any standard conditions for development
cooperation that the individual DP may have. The DPs will keep such g e n e r a l conditions to


                                           - 85 -
a minimum.

11.    ANTI-CORRUPTION

11.1. The GoG and DPs concur that corruption undermines good governance and wastes scare
resources. The GoG and DPs intend to cooperate closely in order to ensure transparency,
accountability and probity in the use of public resources.

12.    CONSULTATION AND TERMINATION

12.1. Any differences or controversies that arise in relation to the MDBS should be settled by
means of dialogue and consultation between DPs and the GoG. The GoG and each DP will
promptly consult with the other participants whenever a DP proposes to suspend or terminate, in
whole or in part, its support to the GPRS II through MDBS.

12.2. This FM remains valid unless cancelled or replaced by a new FM

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under ECF Arrangement for Ghana
and Approves US$91.55 Million Disbursement

Press Release No. 11/469
December 14, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review of Ghana’s economic performance under the program supported by the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). The completion of the review will enable the disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 59.58 million (about US$91.55 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 268.31 million (about US$412.28 million).
The Board also approved a modification of a performance criterion related to Ghana’s
nonconcessional borrowing limit to provide additional room for scaled-up infrastructure
investment.
The three-year ECF arrangement was approved on July 15, 2009, with access equivalent to
SDR 387.45 million (about US$595.35 million or 105 percent of quota).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Ghana, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Ghana’s economy has improved significantly since the start of the government’s Fund-
supported program in 2009. The fiscal and external current account imbalances have been
greatly reduced, growth has strengthened, inflation has declined to single digits, and
international reserves have recovered.
“Pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms will help preserve the
stabilization gains. The government has made great strides in boosting tax revenues and
repaying arrears, and has progressed in its structural reform agenda. Remaining fiscal
challenges relate to further revenue mobilization, containing current spending, and
improving spending efficiency to create space for critical infrastructure investments. The
2012 budget is consistent with making progress in these areas.
“The government’s plans for scaling up critical infrastructure investments translate into
significant financing needs. While the debt sustainability analysis suggests scope for
higher nonconcessional borrowing, and some of the planned projects promise significant
returns, a further strengthening of debt management and project appraisal capacities is
critical to keep the debt burden manageable.
“While energy pricing has improved, decisive action is needed to tackle the reemergence
of costly and poorly targeted subsidies on petroleum products. Following an initial
increase, maintenance of prices at cost-recovery levels will be essential.
“Monetary policy implementation has been consistent with the authorities’ inflation target,
and the Bank of Ghana should stand ready to adjust policy rates as signs of rising price
pressures emerge. To manage liquidity effectively, the Bank of Ghana should continue
refining its policies and communication on foreign exchange market interventions.

supervisory capacity, strengthening banks’ risk management, resolving vulnerable
institutions and addressing deficiencies in Ghana’s Anti-Money Laundering and
