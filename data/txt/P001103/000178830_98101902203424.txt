REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUELIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of
US$7.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the
construction of a road, a bridge, and the preparation of a road feasibility
study.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast is Report
No. AW-38a, "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast,"
September 8, 1972. The report analyzed the country's economic growth
record, which had been favorable by international standards. It concluded
that prospects for further development remain good and that the Govern-
ment's development efforts deserve continued external support. For the
near term (1972-74), however, the report foresaw a temporary setback in
growth. An economic updating mission has recently returned from the
Ivory Coast and is preparing its report. The mission's preliminary
findings are reflected in the following. Annex I contains basic country
data.
3.        From independence until 1971 Ivory Coast's econonm grew at a
high rate (seven percent per year in real terms). Factors contributing to
rapid growth were the Government's liberal and pragmatic economic policies
resulting in a constant inflow of foreign capital and know-how, the avail-
ability of ample land and timber resources, the existence of a large pool
of labor from neighboring countries and, during the late sixties, rising
commodity export prices. The Government, recognizing the country's
vulnerability in its dependence on three export commodities (cocoa, coffee,
and wood), began after 1965 to diversify agriculture -- palm oil, rice,
pineapple, coconut, rubber, sugar -- and to encourage other economic sec-
tors such as industry, tourism, and mining. As a result of these measures,
the Ivory Coast is gradually becoming less dependent on a few major exports.
4.        The Government's develdpment objectives, which include in
addition to broadening the production base the extension of economic infra-
structure in the fields of transport, power, etc., correspond well to the
needs and the possibilities of the country. Furthermore, the Government
is giving increased attention to social infrastructure (housing, education,
water supply, etc.), regional distribution of income, and ivorization of
the economy. However, problems of urbanization, (particularly housing
for the lowest-income groups) and urban unemployment require special atten-
tion. A special Bank employment mission which just returned from the
Ivory Coast will analyze and make recommendations on the treatment of
employment problems in the next five year plan (1976-80).
5.        Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for
further growth. Government and private investment decisions indicate that
the country's growth possibilities are being recognized and exploited.
Despite the uncertainty of market prospects for the country's major export



-2-
commodities, growth in the next ten to fifteen years is likely to remain
well ahead of population growth (3.5 percent a year including immigration).
6.        Although long-term growth prospects are favorable, the economy
is currently going through a period of adjustment which is likely to con-
tinue for the next few years. In 1971 and 1972 real income increased at
a rate only half that of the late nineteen-sixties. There are several
reasons for the temporary slowdown in growth. First, the prices of Ivory
Coast's traditional export commodities began to decline in 1971, while
import prices rose rapidly after 1970. Cocoa prices, which dropped to
almost half the level of early 1970, have since recovered only gradually.
Second, the growth in output of the three major export commodities (cocoa,
coffee, and timber) has slowly declined as resources were being utilized
close to capacity or because of marketing constraints. Cocoa and coffee
production is likely to increase more slowly than in the past decade,
while timber production has reached a plateau, because the most valuable
species are becoming scarce. Third, production increases from past in-
vestments in the diversification of plantation agriculture will have
their full impact only in the second half of the decade.
7.        The slowdown in economic growth  that has manifested itself
since 1970 is leading to a declining growth of government revenue and a
drop in public savings. In particular, the sharp drop of cocoa prices
has hurt public savLigs by curtailing the receipts of the Caisse de
Stabilisation. The shortfall in public savings due to this cause was
equivalent to about one-sixth of public investment in 1971 and 1972, but
a certain improvement may be expected if coffee and cocoa prices continue
to recover as they have this year. The resulting tight financial situation
moved the Government to introduce austerity policies in the 1972 budget
with regard to public spencding and to reduce total budgeted puiblic i-nvest-
ment by 16 percent below the 1971 level.
During the high growth period of the years 1967-70, the
Government had become accustomed to a high and rising level of current and
Investment expenditure. Despite the austerity measures taken in 1S972
expenditures continued to increase last year in excess of available domes-
tic and foreign resources. To finance this, the Government drew down
CFAF 21 billion ($91 million) or 60 percent of its net foreign exchange
reserves. This year the GDvernment has continued its austerity program
and instituted limitations on personnel recruitment to curtail the growth
in current expenditure. However, further adjustments will probably have
to be made, particularly with regard to administrative and recurrent ex-
penditures, to finance the public investment program.
9.        Even with good fiscal performance, the financing of a reasonable
public investment program of about $250 million a year during 1973-75 will
require a large increase in foreign aid. Public savings after debt ser-
vice could cover, at best, 40 percent of such an investment program. This
would leave a gap of about $155 million per year to be financed by dis-
bursements on grant and loan funds and increased mobilization of private
domestic savings. It is probable that funds of this magnitude can be



-3-
obtained, but a substantial increase in disbursements will be needed
over the level of previous years ($70 million in 1970; $100 million in
1971; and $115 million in 1972). The principal sources of development
finance for the Ivory Coast are France, the European Economic Community
anid the World Bank Group. (The United States, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy, Canada and a few other countries also supply aid). Bi-
lateral assistance and the EEC should disburse about $75 million per
year and the Bank Group about $30 million a year. The remaining $50
million would come from the mobilization of private domestic savings and
foreign private credits.
10.        While past domestic borrowing by the Government has shown that
there is some modest scope for mobilization of private savings for the
public investment program, the Government will clearly have to step up
its foreign borrowing and watch carefully the terms and conditions on
which it acquires both domestic and external financing in order to avoid
a too rapid build-up of debt service obligations. On December 31, 1972,
external debt stood at about $640 million. The debt service ratio --
about 7 percent in 1972 -- is still low. By the end of the decade, how-
ever, debt service could become a major problem, both as a burden on
the balance of payments and especially in terms of its claim on fiscal
resources. Preliminary projections indicate that in the second half of
the 1970's, debt service could climb to over 70 percent of public savings,
thus markedly reducing the Government's capacity to finance the local
currency component of public investment. (The Bank Group's share of the
Ivory Coast's external debt is approximately 14% and could rise in the
next five year period to about 17%).
11.         The recent slowdown in economic growth, caused predominantly
by declining terms of trade, has led to a less favorable financial situa-
tion. Therefore, the Government will either have to obtain more foreign
aid on appropriate terms or it will have to scale down its investments.
Since the development program is by and large well conceived, the latter
course would mean a loss of growth. In view of the long-term difficulties
the country will have in mobilizing sufficient resources to achieve its
basic development goals and the prospect of further deterioration of the
debt service situation, the Government requested the Bank Group to provide
some part of its assistance to the Ivory Coast in the form of IDA credits.
12.       While the Ivory Coast can service additional debt on conventional
terms and the bulk of the Bank Group's assistance should continue on this
basis, I do think that it would be appropriate to regard this country as
eligible for a limited amount of IDA lending. The Ivory Coast meets the
ordinary criteria for IDA lending -- its per capita GNP in 1970 was $310
and its economic and financial performance have been creditable. Other
sources of official development assistance have been prepared to provide
part of their financing to the Ivory Coast on concessional terms, and I
think it would be reasonable for us to do our part in avoiding the po-
tential debt service problems which have been described in paragraph 10
above.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
13.       Since 1968 the Bank's role in lending to the Ivory Coast has
expanded rapidly, eleven loans to the Ivory Coast totalling US$94.8
million having been made. Three of these have been for roads; five
were made to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the develop-
ment of oil paLm and coconut plantations and the construction of two oil
mills; the remaining three loans were for education, cocoa, and a rubber
plantation. The IFC has taken a small ($200,000) participation in the
Banque Ivorienne de Developpement Industriel. The proposed operation
would be the first TDA Credit to the Ivory Coast. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Loans and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects with particular reference to those which are encountering
problems in execution and giving rise to delay in disbursement.
14.       The First Highway Project (Loan 542, June 21, 1968, US$5.8
million) provided for the construction of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou
road (60 km.) and feasibility and engineering studies. It has now been
substantially and successfully completed. The Second Highway Project
(Loan 761, June 22, 1971, US$20.5 million) included the construction of
the Yabayo-Duekoue-Man and Bouake-Katiola roads (287 km.). Execution of
the second project is proceeding on schedule. A change in the routing of
the Yabayo-Duekoue road has been requested by the Government and a proposal
to amend this loan will soon be made to the Executive Directors. The Third
Highway Project (Loan 837, June 23, 1972, US$17.5 million) provided for a
road maintenance and betterment program and the realignment and reinforcing
of three major roads. It was made effective on May 4, 19-73, and work on
the road maintenance and betterment program has started.
15.       The Ivory Coast's principal foreign exchange earner and source
of employment is the agricultural sector. It is also the sector that has
expanded most rapidly. Since it will continue to provide close to 90
percent of exports, to create job opportunities, to stabilize an increasing-
ly mobile population, and to bring development to remote areas of the
country, the Bank's principal efforts in the identification and preparation
of projects is in this area. We are currently financing studies under
Loan 686 (Cocoa Project) which should lead to a cocoa project by 1975
and are participating with the CCCE in preparing a rice project in the
West of the Ivory Coast. The Ivory Coast has also requested our assistance
in financing a cotton project and additional oil palm and coconut develop-
ment, and in providing agrilcultural credit.
16.       In general, the -transport projects financed by the Bank Group
support the agricultural development of the country. The Bank has, how-
ever, become the principal lender for the road transport sector largely
due to the fact that it was closely associated, as Executing Agency,
with the 1968 UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast. We expect that
projects identiflied by this survey will continue to be submitted to the
Bank Group for financing in the next few years, in particular the Abidjan-
Agboville and Katiola-Badikaha roads. The Government is also interested
in obtaining our assistance in financing the realignment of a section of
une Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other sections of the rail line are
being financed by the European Development Fund and the European Invest-
ment Bank.



17.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social
sectors in which we expect to be involved, although our financial par-
ticipation is expected to remain relatively modest. The UNDP is financing
a two-phase study of the sanitation needs of Abidjan and it is expected
that this study will provide the basis for an urban sanitation project
for Abidjan in the near future. A Second Education Project is presently
being prepared with the assistance of UNESCO. Substantial investments
are also foreseen, in the later years, for industry, power, and possibly
tourism, areas in which we have not previously been involved, but in
which the Government foresees the need for the Bank Group's participation.
The Government has requested Bank financing for part of its 1972-74
telecommunications program and a project is to be appraised in the near
future.
PART III - TRANSPORT SECTOR
18.       The country's basic network of first class roads has not kept
pace with its economic development. The road network has grown since
the mid-forties from some 10,000 km. to over 30,000 km. Over 6,000 km.
of these roads are designed for heavy traffic, 14,000 km. are all-weather
roads, but only about 1,680 km. have been paved. The highway network
serves most of the country except some underdeveloped areas which are not
tied into the econony. The rapid growth in economic activity was accom-
panied by a substantial traffic increase. The vehicle park which contains
about 130,000 vehicles has been growing recently at 12.5 percent per year.
While roads form the main transport infrastructure of the country, the
major link with the North and Upper Volta is the railway line between
Abidjan and Ouagadougou. External commerce is carried out principally
through the port of Abidjan; the new port of San Pedro which commenced
operations in 1971 will serve the rapidly developing Southwestern part
of the country.
19.       In 1968, the United Nations Development Programme, with the Bank
as Executing Agency, financed a transport survey of the country. The con-
clusion the survey reached was that major emphasis must be given to up-
grading the country's basic road network, which is the backbone of the
transport system. The survey calls for the construction or improvement
of more than 1,700 km. of roads including strengthening of about 400 mn.
According to forecasts prepared by the consultants who carried out the
survey in 1969, passenger transport demand was expected to grow at about
5 percent p.a. between 1970-75, and cargo transport demand at 3 percent.
However, these projections appear to have been conservative, and actual
growth rates have been about twice those forecast for 1970-72.
20.       The transport sector absorbs a large part of public investment.
In 1970 and 1971 investments were high because of the San Pedro port
project, the first stage of which is nearing completion. The three-year
investment program lists road projects totalling CFAF 25.5 billion for the
period 1973-1975. The Government's new Five-Year Plan points out the
need to reduce the cost of transport by improving the quality of the road
network to encourage commerce and assist in the development of areas of
the country which are remote from the coast.



-6-
21.       The Government's road development plans for the next several
years include the following major elements: road betterment in agri-
cultural areas and improvement in general maintenance; strengthening
and paving the road links between Abidjan and the West of the country,
particularly the new port of San Pedro; and the improvement of the
direct route North to Mali and Upper Volta. Redirection of the western
timber traffic along new roads toward the port of San Pedro is already
being financed. Studies of a coastal road link with Ghana have recently
been completed.
22.       Transport regulations, which concern mainly road transport
because of its predominance in the country, are established by the Gov-
ernment. These regulations are presently under review. During negotiations,
the Association agreed with the Government that on completion of this
policy review it would consult the Association on any important changes
before they are initiated.
23        An area of goverrnental policy where changes might be advisable
in the near future is road user taxation.   In order to formulate a more
rational road user taxation policy, a study was commissioned, and loan
761-IVC was amended to include this study in the project. The Government
is also aware of the need t) coordinate investments between competing
modes of transport and studies are being made of the relative merits of
investment in the railway and the roads where they serve the same areas.
24.       The Ministiy of Public Works and Transport (MFWT) is responsible
for transport planning at the sectorial level. The planning function of
the MPWT needs to be strengthened. During negotiation of the proposed
project, the Government agreed to take the necessary measures to build up
the sectorial planning capacity of the NPWT.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Fourth Highway Project'" (147a -
IVC, dated June 6, 1973) is being distributed separately. A credit and
project summary is in Annex III. The project is composed of the following
elements:
(a)  construction of the Yabayo-Gagnoa road (79 tm.);
(b) reconstructLon of the N'Zi river bridge; and,
(c) a feeder road study in cotton growing areas.
26.       Parts (a) and (b) of the project were identified by the 1969
TJNDP Transport Survey and lwere appraised in January/February of this
year. The pre-investment studies and detailed engineering for the road
and bridge construction were carried out by the French consulting firm
SETEC. The feeder road Ftucly has been recommlended by the Bank's Per-
manent Mission in West Africa which is assisting the Government in the
preparation of a cotton planting scheme. Negotiation of the project
took place May 2a-25. The Ivorian delegation was led by Mr. Hovine,
Director General of the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement, and included
Mr. Boni, the Director General of Public Works, Mr. Kpatchibo, Director
of the Investment Budget, Mr. Kra, Director of Pluriannual Programs, Mr.



-7-
Tiabas, Director of the Freight Office, Mr. Douoguih, Economic Counselor,
and Mr. Torczyner, Attorney.
27.       The Yabayo-Gagnoa road will form an important element in the
road network serving the new port of San Pedro in the Southwest of the
Ivory Coast. It will link the center of the country with the San Pedro-
Issia road financed by the European Development Fund and the European
Investment Bank and thus provide a shorter route for traffic between the
Gagnoa area and the port of San Pedro. The road from Abidjan to Gagnoa
is also paved, thus the Yabayo-Gagnoa road will also link up the paved
highway network between Abidjan and San Pedro.
28.       The bridge over the N'Zi river is located on the main trunk
road between Abidjan and Bouake, the two largest cities in the Ivory
Coast. It is part of the N'douci-Toumodi road which is being strengthened
and partially realigned with funds provided in the Third Highway Project.
The present bridge is a one lane structure built in 1934 (180 meters in
length). It has had to be reinforced. Nevertheless, the allowable load
limit is one truck crossing it at low speed. The bridge is unsafe and
there is a growing risk that it might have to be closed to traffic. This
could result in substantial losses to the country since the bridge is a
link in the main highway system of the Ivory Coast.
29.       Financing:  The following table shows the breakdown in the
capital costs of the project, which totals $12.3 million:
Local     Foreign     Total
Yabayo-Gagnoa road                    3,472       5,O58      8,530
N'Zi river bridge                       516         774      1,290
Construction supervision                138        552        690
Feeder Road Study                         9         49          58
Contingencies                           663      1,o69      1,732
Rounded Total                         4,800      7,500      12,300
Taxes would represent about US$3.0 million.  Of the net cost of US$9.3
million, IDA would finance US$7.5 million representing the estimated
cost in foreign exchange and 81% of project cost net of taxes. The cost
estimates for the road construction are based on detailed engineering
carried out by consultants SETEC (France) in 1972. Estimates for the
reconstruction of the N'Zi bridge were based on the results of inter-
national competitive bidding carried out in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines.
30.       Procurement and Disbursement: The Public Works Department
in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport would be responsible for
the execution of the project and will be assisted by consultants. The
road construction work would be carried out by contractors and would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The contract
for the construction of the bridge was awarded in May of this year to
the SETAO construction companjy (French) after international competitive bidding.



-8-
Consultant's services, particularly supervision of construction, would
be contracted with consulting firms, although experts for the feeder
road study may be hired on an individual basis. The proceeds of the
Credit will be disbursed to cover 60% of civil works expenditures and
the foreign exchange cost of consultants services.
3t.           Feeder Road Study: The Government has requested the Bank
to finance a project for the expansion of the area under cotton cul-
tivation. The project would include credits to farmers for fertilizers,
seed, insecticides, and agricultural equipment, extension services, feeder
road improvements, well drilling, storage facilities, new ginning capacity
and possibly an oil mill. Our Permanent Mission in West Africa,which is
assisting the Government in thLe preparation of this project,has advised
the Government to study the need to improve the network of secondary roads
serving the cotton growing areas. The Government has agreed to undertake
such a survey of the feeder road network which should be ready by the
time the proposed cotton project is to be appraised.
32.           Rate of Return: The Yabayo-Gagnoa road is expected to reduce
transportation costs between 'San Pedro and Gagnoa by 30% and to generate
increased traffic. The rate of return of the road was found to be 15%
on the basis of savings in transport costs. Reconstruction of the N'Zi
bridge will avoid substantial expenditures for repair and strengthening of
the existing structure Mnd also yield savings in vehicle operating costs.
The economic return for constructing a new two-lane bridge at the present
time instead of ten years hence is estimated to be about 1h%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.           The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Bank and
the Republic of the Ivory Coast, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
34.           The Credit Agreement conforms substantial1y to the pattern
of recent agreements used for highway projects. As a condition of effec-
tiveness of this Credit, the Borrower is required to employ consultants
acceptable to the Bank for the supervision of construction of the road
and the bridge included in the Project.
I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
