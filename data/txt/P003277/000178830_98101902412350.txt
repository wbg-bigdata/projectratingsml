LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                         Zimbabwe
Amount                           US$40.0 million, including capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms                            Payable in 20 years, including five years of
grace with variable interest rate.
Purpose                          The proposed loan would assist the National
Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to maintain its
operational efficiency by filling critical
staff positions and prevent deterioration of
its equipment and fixed installations,
through financing technical assistance,
training and srare parts.
Benefits                         The technical assistance and training to be
provided would enable NRZ to retain manpower
capabilities essential for its efficient
operations. Provision of essential spare
parts would preserve the performance levels
that otherwise would be lost. Substantially
reduced railway capacity would have severe
adverse effects on the Zimbabwean economy
generally as well as on the economies of
neighboring countries dependent on NRZ'
transit facilities.
Risks                            The overall performance of NRZ could be
adversely affected by an acceleration in the
rate of departure of experienced skilled
staff. It is etxpected that Government will
follow manpower policies consistent with the
effective operations of NRZ and, if
necessary, recruit additional expatriate
technical assistance and accelerate the
training program for Africans.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ZIMBABWE
FOR A RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Zimbabwe for US$40.0 million payable in 20 years, including five
years of grace with variable interest rates, to help finance a Railway
Development Project for the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), including
provision of spare parts and equipment.
PART I - THE ECONO0MY
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980. A Country Economic Memorandum (Report Num-
ber 3234a-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1981.
This description is based on that memorandum and on information obtained on
subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the
northwest and the Republic of South Africa on the south. The population as
of December 1981, was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom are
Africans. 1 The remainder consists of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000
Asians and 23,000 people of mixed origin. ThE growth rate of the African
population is estimated to be about 3.4 percerLt per year. The number of
Europeans has been declining due to emigration, which has recently been
occurring at an average rate of about 1,700 persons per month. According
to estimates based on pre-independence data, 20 percent of the population
is urban; but this is almost certain to understate the present extent of
urbanization.
1 The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature Eor population divisions is
used throughout. The first census since 1969 was carried out in August
1982; the results are not yet available.



- 2 -
4.        In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
of income and assets between Africans and Europeans remains highly skewed.
The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and confirmed
division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal parts for
European and African settlements, the Europeans possessing most of the best
land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups, the divi-
sion resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately 2.5 ha per
African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity will begin to
change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar disparities
exist in the distribution of other productive assets and income. Rough
estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income suggest that
the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110 (US$175) com-
pared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.       Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in
1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions, and in 1973,
a costly guerrilla war started. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965, when they began, and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7 percent
per year and per capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded, en-
hancing the country's ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimulated
development of local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979 consumer
goocds were only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with 22 percent
in 1964. Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of commercial agri-
culture and the rapid growth of investment in and exports from the mining
sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufact-
uring and mining are all important, contributing 18 percent, 26 percent,
and 5 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1981, and together providing
52 percent of total formal employment.  Agriculture and forestry account
for more than 290,000 jobs or 28 percent of the total; manufacturing for
173,000 jobs and mining for 69,000. Most of the remaining formal employ-
ment is provided by service sectors such as public administration, educa-
tion and, in particular, domestic service. Mining and agriculture earn
sign:ificant amounts of foreign exchange and supply most inputs for manufac-
turing, which in turn accounts for between 30 and 35 percent of Zimbabwe's
merchandise exports, mainly processed agricultural and mineral items.



8.         Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased
by 47 percent in 1980 and by 26 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been exitremely strong in agriculture,
which benefited from good weather in 1980 and 1981. Consequently, overall
real growth of the economy was about 11 percent in 1980, and over 8 percent
in 1981.
9.       The substantial increase in imports in 1980/81 was financed with
reserve drawdowns and short-term borrowings. This increase in imports and
short-term borrowing, coupled with a slower than required rate of growth of
exports, has resulted in a very serious balance-of-payments situation.
10.      Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the country
is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-run
problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (currently
about 17 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being imple-
mented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been raised.
The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent in
1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of GDP
has declined from its high of 12 percent in 1979/80 to 8 percent in
1981/82. However, further reductions must be accomplished during the cur-
rent (1982/83) budgetary exercise if stabilization efforts are to fully
succeed. Significant longer-term problems concern the need to increase the
level and quality of investment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a
wage policy consistent with the need to increase employment. Although
these issues are interrelated, the Government recognizes that increasing
employment and labor productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth
with equity.
11.      The Government is taking measures to address some of these prob-
lems. It has published a Transitional National Development Plan: 1982/83-
1984/85 which sets the course for the economy. In addition, the Government
has agreed with the IMF on a stabilization program which stipulates a num-
ber of measures, including: an exchange rate adjustment (as a result of
the dialogue, the Government devalued the Zimbabwean dollar by 20 percent
on December 9, 1982 in order to restore export competitiveness that had
been eroded by large increases in labor costs and high domestic inflation);
an adjustment in the basket of currencies on which the value of the Zimbab-
wean dollar is determined; a reduction in the budgetary deficit; limita-
tions to wage and salary increases; and ceilings to short-term external
debt and domestic credit. Furthermore, the recently approved Manufacturing
Export Promotion program is also designed to deal with some of the prob-
lems.
12.      Should the measures Government is taking effectively deal with the
above-mentioned problems, prospects for respectable growth and more equit-
able distribution of income are quite good. Real increases in GDP could



-4-
well average 5.5 percent per year in 1980-85.  Thereafter growth could
slow, perhaps, to an average of four percent per year, as investments are
made in longer-gestating programs with a more even distribution of assets.
Much of the burden of achieving these growth and equity goals must fall on
the agricultural sector.  In the past, the commercial farms accounted for
most agricultural production. However, the development of smallholder
agriculture has been assigned the highest priority.
13.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In December 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$948 million (US$1,318 million equivalent) and the country's
gross, international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated
two months of imports.  The external debt figure was equivalent to about
24 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which was about 4
percent in 1980, is estimated to have risen to 8 and 15 percent in 1981 and
1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly all
Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six years which will
exert pressures on the short-term balance-of-payments situation. However,
so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of short-term com-
mercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to decline after
1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrowing. In light of
this and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe is
creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the country's massive ex-
ternal resource requirements for the next few years and the expected high
level of international interest rates and relatively hard repayment terms
of non-concessionary borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to receive
part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million
benef[ting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$9.0 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of
the loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for
agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its
two loans after the lifting of sanctions on December 21, 1979. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed priority
import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components and bal-
ancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sec-
tor. The Bank also approved a loan (1994-ZIM) of US$42 million to finance
import requirements of spare parts, track maintenance equipment and tools
for the railways, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment Department
and technical assistance. A summary statement of Bank Group operations and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects are provided in Annex II.



- 5 -
Project implementation thus far is satisfactory and disbursements have kept
to schedule.
15.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, to help finance a
project for producing coal for a thermal power station, now being con-
structed, and other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38 mil-
lion loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC's own account, and
US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan. IFC was
also responsible for arranging a further IJS$10.3 million of commercial bank
financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States.
16.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects for manpower
development and training, agriculture, rural development, forestry, and
industrial development through a developmant finance company. A Small Farm
Credit project, approved by the Board in September 1982, will provide the
Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds for seasonal loans and for
medium- and long-term loans for equipment and farm improvements, as well as
technical assistance. A Petroleum Fuels Supply Technical Assistance proj-
ect was also approved in September 1982. A Power project, approved by the
Board in December 1982, will enhance electric generating capacity through
extension of the Hwange Thermal Power Station. It also includes construc-
tion of a transmission line, technical assistance and training. In
February 1983, the Board approved a Manufacturing Export Promotion program,
designed to increase Zimbabwe's export earnings. Projects to improve
Zimbabwe's road transport system and support rural afforestation were
approved by the Board in May 1983. A project strengthening national agri-
cultural extension and research programs is expected to be presented to the
Board in early FY84.
17.      The Bank has reviewed the agriculture, energy, urban, education
and manpower, population, health and nutrition, and telecommunications sec-
tors, for which reports either have been completed or are being written.
18.      Since Bank lending to Zimbabwe is very recent, Bank Group exposure
is still very low. At the end of 1981, the Bank accounted for six percent
and IDA and the Bank combined for about eight percent, of Zimbabwe's ex-
ternal public debt.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Transport System
19.      Zimbabwe possesses, on the whole, a well-developed basic transport
system. The railway which is administered by a state-owned corporation --
the National Railways of Zimbabwe -- is t:he primary mode of transport. The
system consists of 3,374 km of track of which 640 km are in Botswana, but
owned and operated by NRZ. Of Zimbabwe's 85,621 km road network, about



- 6 -
14 percent is paved and another 54 percent *is gravelled. The remaining
32 percent consists of earth tracks. Air Zimbabwe provides both domestic
and international services; over the past five years, it has carried more
than one million passengers yearly and has embarked on a modernization pro-
gram. There are eight airports in the country of which three -- Harare,
Bulawayo and Victoria Falls -- are international.
Regional Importance
20.      Zimbabwe's transport network is of vital importance to the entire
southern Africa region.  The country sits astride key railway and road
routes which offer Zaire and landlocked Zambia and Botswana access to the
sea. NRZ links with the South African Railway at the Zimbabwe border and
through Botswana, with the Zambia Railways (which, in turn, connects to the
Tanzania-Zambia (TAZARA) line to Dar-es-Salaam) and with the Mozambican
Railway lines to both Maputo and Beira. Road links between Zimbabwe and
neighboring countries also carry significant international traffic although
the volume is much less than that transported by railway.
21.      Zimbabwe's shortest routes to the sea are through Mozambique; the
latter country earns a significant part of its foreign exchange from trans-
it traffic, some of which moves through Zimbabwe. The rail routes through
the Republic of South Africa and the TAZARA Railway to Dar-es-Salaam con-
stitute alternative regional channels. The routes through Mozambique have
experienced declining traffic but will continue to be of some importance
for Zimbabwean traffic. The region would greatly benefit by more coordina-
tion of action on: (a) traffic-related matters (tariff levels, import
quotas, customs procedures, etc.); (b) specifications for equipment; (c)
sharing of maintenance facilities; (d) a system for ensuring speedy return
of railway wagons crossing internatiQnal boundaries; and (e) improvements
in regional communications which are important to regional transport. The
Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference, established in 1980,
has attempted to foster joint action on these various subjects.
Conditions of the Network
22.      Zimbabwe emerged from the war with most of its transport infra-
structure intact, although the Harare-Maputo railway line suffered exten-
sive damage, as did many roads. Bank strategy in the sector has been to
concentrate initially on rehabilitation of existing transport infrastruc-
ture. The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program, Loan 1994-ZIM,
approved on May 19, 1981, has partially alleviated problems of deteriorated
railway and road conditions. This US$42 million loan has helped to meet
priority requirements of spare parts and track maintenance equipment and
tools for the railway, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment
Department (CMED) and technical assistance. Implementation of the project
shouLd be completed in 1983. An analysis of conditions in the road and
rail subsectors is given below.



Roads
23.      Road construction and maintenance is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic (MRRT) which deals with the 18,221 km of
Zimbabwe's most important roads (state roads). Rural councils and the dis-
trict administrations look after the remaining roads (about 67,400 km).
The road network is adequate. However, there is urgent need for strength-
ening, upgrading and rehabilitating some of the roads which were affected
by the war.
24.      The MRRT has prepared a 1982-84 development program estimated to
cost about Z$95.0 million. The Bank's lending operations are expected to
support this program, as in the case of the Highway I project recently
approved by the Board (May 1983). Budgetary allocations for recurrent
expenditures for state roads are adequate, and rural councils are given
sufficient grants from the Central Government to supplement revenue from
local taxation of vehicles.
25.      Although there is a shortage of staff in the MRRT at all levels,
the standard of construction and maintenance of the road network is high.
Good training institutions are available but lack sufficient instructors
and they need to be expanded in order to meet the increasing demand for
technical and skilled staff. The Bank is expected to assist MRRT by fin-
ancing technical assistance and training under future highway projects.
Railways
26.      Of the railways' track, the mainline portions generally are in
good condition, except for sections close to Mozambique and the 640 km
stretch in Botswana. During the war, ,lit.tle capital work was undertaken
and track maintenance was severely curtailed. Branch lines need upgrading,
and the outmoded signalling systems still in use should be replaced. NRZ
plans to change these systems in conjunction with its electrification pro-
gram which is phased over a number of years. The first stage of this pro-
gram, 335 km of track between Gweru and FEarare, is virtually completed.
NRZ is presently investigating the feasibility of continuing this program.
For further development of the rail system, NRZ plans to invest Z$66.0 mil-
lion in FY84, Z$52.6 million in FY85, ancl Z$38.4 million in FY86, a total
of Z$157.0 million over the three-year period. The investment plan excludes
electrification beyond Stage I (Annex IV'. Bank staff have reviewed the
plan and consider it reasonable; any changes in the plan amounting to more
than US$2.0 million equivalent in any one year would be made only after
consultation with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
27.      NRZ has 283 diesel electric locomotives of which 91 are set aside
for reconstruction and rehabilitation; availability of diesel locomotives
is low (about 55 percent) because of a serious shortage of staff to main-
tain them. The railway also has 131 steam locomotives, of which 47 are set
aside for possible refurbishing; availability of these units is also low
(about 50 percent) as a result of skilled labor shortages. The wagon



-8-
fleet, consisting of some 13,000 units shows a relatively good availability
(about 94 percent). Many wagons, however, are very old and in poor condi-
tion. The 475 passenger coaches likewise are, with few exceptions, old and
in poor condition.
28.      One central maintenance workshop in Bulawayo maintains all equip-
ment, while a smaller workshop in Mutare repairs wagons and diesel locomo-
tives, and five others repair steam locomotives. Although the workshops
(built in the early 1900s) and the machinery (25-30 years old) are in good
condition, most of the latter will be replaced within ten years. The qual-
ity of maintenance is high, but capacity is seriously limited by the short-
age of skilled labor.
29.      The railway handled a total of 13.3 million tons of freight traf-
fic in FY82. Most of the railways' eight million tons of local traffic
consisted of coal, iron ore, fertilizer and agricultural products. In
FY82, exports and imports accounted for about one-third of total freight.
Coal, steel, maize and sugar were the main export commodities carried.
Transit traffic in FY82, critically important to Zaire and Zambia, totalled
about one million tons, a large part of which was copper concentrates. NRZ
is projecting its freight traffic to rise to 16 million tons or by nearly
20 percent by FY85. A more realistic estimate would be about 14 million
tons or a six percent increase.
NRZ' Management and Manpower Situation
30.      NRZ is well managed but some vacancies have occurred recently as a
result of retirements of middle-level managerial staff which might have an
adverse effect on railway operations in the future. Further, most of the
senior managers are nearing retirement age and, therefore, critical vacan-
cies will soon develop.  Some of the younger managerial staff are leaving
the country in pursuit of other opportunities. Also, shortages are
anticipated among specialized staff such as computer specialists, engineers
and accountants. The organization chart of NRZ is in Annex V.
31.      Of the 1,600 artisan positions critical to railway operations,
about 200 positions are vacant and about 400 positions are presently filled
by expatriate artisans recruited for two-year terms under contracts fin-
anced by the ongoing Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program. This loan
also finances spare parts and other critical equipment required to prevent
deterioration of railway performance. While the loan has largely solved
the spare part problem over the short term, the shortage of skilled labor
continues to be a major problem and would become particularly severe if the
contracts for the 400 expatriate artisans now in NRZ are not extended.
32.      The severe shortages of skilled labor in NRZ (Annexes VI and VII)
impose a heavy burden on the existing training capacity of the rail system.
At present, training is offered in all functions of NRZ including traffic,
engineering, services and manpower. A great variety of courses are in-
cluded in the training program, both in-service and outside NRZ. With



- 9 -
regard to training of engineers and technicians, NRZ sponsors students to
attend university and polytechnic programs. Training for the traffic and
services functions comprises mainly shorter courses with durations ranging
from a few weeks to six months and aims at upgrading and promoting existing
staff. The shortages of skilled staff are particularly severe for artisans
of the engineering function. Training of such artisans is carried out
through an apprenticeship program of four years duration, comprising two
years of practical/theoretical training in the NRZ training center and two
years on-the-job training in the workshops. The length of the program was
recently reduced from five to four years. NRZ will review the program with
a view to achieving greater specialization and this should further reduce
the training time. The organization chart of the manpower and training
function is in Annex VIII.
33.      Entrance requirement for an apprentice is the completion of secon-
dary school ("0" Level). Intake of apprentices has been steadily increas-
ing in recent years and was about 140 in January 1982. NRZ plans to in-
crease further the intake when expanded i-acilities are available by the end
of 1983. The 1983 intake will be about 200 and that of 1984 is expected to
be about 320 students.
Financial Performance
34.      Although from the operational point of view, NRZ is a well-managed
and fairly efficient organization, it has experienced financial losses be-
cause the Government has required certain traffic to be transported at low
rates. Consequently, NRZ has incurred a financial deficit each year since
1971, and has depended on heavy annual government subsidies ranging from
Z$1.7 million in 1971 to Z$39.0 million in 1982. Freight traffic repre-
sents more than 90 percent of NRZ' revenues; about a dozen commodities
account for most of this traffic with coal being the most important at
about 25 percent of total freight tonnage. NRZ has an elaborate tariff
structure and a fairly adequate procedure for costing the various services
it renders. Because of the overall control exercised by Government,
especially on the rate structure, NRZ is not in a position to revise its
tariff based on costs, and its financial difficulties are primarily the
result of subeconomic rates charged for hauling commodities, especially
coal, coke and agricultural products, under government directives.
35.      Section 24 of the National Railways of Zimbabwe Act stipulates
that NRZ should operate on a commercial basis and should conduct its busi-
ness in such a way as to achieve an annual income sufficient to meet all
its operating expenses as well as interest and debt service charges. The
Act further provides that if in any year the income of the railways were
insufficient to meet these charges, the Government would be obligated to
meet this deficit. It is under this provision that the Government has been
providing subsidies. However, subsidies for rail transport for specific
commodities should be clearly identified and segregated from NRZ'
operations and dealt with separately by Government (instead of covering
them under the overall deficit of the railways), so that NRZ functions as a



- 10 -
financially viable entity.  Both the Government and NRZ recognize the prob-
lem and several tariff increases have been allowed in the past to help im-
prove the finances of NRZ; the last two such increases being effective from
May 1981 and July 1982, respectively. Further, with Loan 1994-ZIM, the
Government and NRZ agreed that the latter would endeavor to achieve a work-
ing ratio of 110 in FY83 and 100 in FY85. During negotiations the Govern-
ment agreed to take all possible measures to enable NRZ to achieve a work-
ing ratio of 100 for the Fiscal Years 1985 and 1986 (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.06).
36.      Government has undertaken a study of the railways' tariff and cost
structure with a view to rationalizing the tariff and improving the rail-
ways' finances. This study has been completed and the railways and Govern-
ment are now, in consultation with the Bank, reviewing the findings and
recommendations. This review will require some time to finalize and imple-
ment since it involves an indepth analysis of the freight traffic carried
during 1982 and a critical analysis of the financial and operational ef-
fects of the proposed changes in the rate structure vis-a-vis anticipated
traffic. This work is presently being undertaken by the railways.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.      During a Bank mission to Zimbabwe in February 1982, the Minister
of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, requested the Bank to assist
NRZ by financing urgently needed expatriate manpower to fill vacancies
created by departing European artisans for a period during which efforts
would be made to train Africans to fill the positions permanently. The re-
quest included a component to expand and strengthen NRZ' training capa-
city. The request was reviewed in detail by Bank missions which visited
Zimbabwe in May and September 1982. The project was appraised in November
1982 and negotiations were held in Washington in June 1983. The Zimbabwean
delegation was led by Mr. Isaac Takawira, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of
Finance, Economic Planning and Development. A loan and project summary is
given at the beginning of this report.
Identification and Preparation
38.      The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan included funds
for technical assistance, mainly to assist NRZ in the rehabilitation of
locoraotives. However, soon after loan effectiveness, it became clear that
the departure of trained staff, mainly artisans, would continue and that
the number of vacancies among the artisans critical to the railways' suc-
cessful operation was increasing.
39.      The NRZ manpower and training study which was completed by consul-
tants in October 1982 and reviewed by Bank staff showed that NRZ, in the
short term, would need a sizeable input of foreign assistance to meet
skilled labor shortages, presently constituting about 40 percent of the



- 11 -
otal number of skilled staff critical to the railway operation.  In the
ionger term, however, the existing training capacity would require substan-
tial expansion to meet the anticipated manpower demand, particularly for
workshop personnel but also for staff in other categories such as engineers
and computer programmers. According to the study, the training capacity
should be increased by about 50 percent in order to reduce by 1987 the de-
pendence on external technical assistance and to meet the total manpower
demand by 1991-92. The function which has suffered most as a result of the
exodus of trained staff is engineering. GJonsequently, training for arti-
sans for maintenance and related skills is a high priority in the proposed
project.
Objectives and Description of the Project
40.      The project would assist NRZ to sustain its transport capacity and
operational efficiency, particularly to prevent further deterioration of
its equipment and fixed installations, and would expand and strengthen the
existing staff training program. The project would comprise the following
components.
Staffing Program
41.      Financial assistance to continue the contracts of 400 essential
expatriate artisans hired under the Transport Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram and to fill additional vacancies of 200 other artisans and key staff.
In total, about 600 expatriate artisans will be required plus some
specialized higher level expatriate staff during the planned three-year
period 1983-1985 (Annex VII).
Training Program
42.      Technical assistance would be provided through provisions for
specialists and fellowships. Included would be a training coordinator,
instructors and curriculum development specialists. Fellowships would be
funded for overseas study for key training staff and engineers and man-
agers (Annex VII). Training equipment and certain printing/duplicating
equipment and audio visual aids would be included in the proposed project.
Spare Parts
43.      A continuous supply of spare parts is essential for reliable rail-
way operations. However, foreign exchange for the procurement of spare
parts is becoming increasingly scarce. Consequently, the project includes
funds for NRZ' priority requirements for spare parts and materials for
locomotives and essential equipment critical to efficient operations. The
amount proposed constitutes 15 percent oE NRZ' total need for the project
period. A maintenance program (Annex IX) for locomotives and essential
equipment has been agreed during negotiations and will be reviewed annually
by NRZ and the Bank during project implementation (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.04).   In addition, the Government's contribution towards



- 12 -
financing the required spare parts and materials for reliable railway oper-
ations has been agreed (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(b)). A special
account will be established by the Government for procurement of spare
parts and materials, and payment to that account of the first installment
(US$1.0 million) of the Government's contribution is a condition of loan
effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement, Sections 3.01(b) and 6.01). During
impLementation, NRZ shall from time to time prepare lists of spare parts
and materials to be procured.  Such lists shall be reviewed and approved by
the Bank and upon such approvals the Borrower shall promptly replenish the
special account with its share of the cost of the items approved, until the
aggregate amount of the initial deposit and subsequent replenishments reach
US$10.0 million (draft Loan Agreement, Sections 3.01(b) and 3.05).
Pre-investment Studies
44.      Due to the departure of key staff, the capacity of the NRZ to
undertake studies and to prepare projects has been severely curtailed.
Funds are provided, therefore, for the hiring of consultants to assist in
the formulation of an investment plan, appropriate traffic forecasts and
financial projections as well as in training planning-branch staff for NRZ
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(a) and (b)). In addition, consultants
will be hired to help update, every six months, the existing manpower study
which is expected to enable NRZ to monitor in detail the progress in re-
cruitment, training and promotion of personnel (draft Loan Agreement, Sec-
tion 3.02(c)).
Project Costs and Financing Plan
45.      The total cost of the project, including the front-end fee and
taxes estimated at US$6.6 million equivalent, is estimated at US$121.3 mil-
lion. Cost estimates are based on recent contracts for similar services
and goods financed under the Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan
(para. 22). The man-month rate for technical assistance under the staffing
program is estimated at US$1,750 equivalent for artisans and US$3,600-4,300
for other staff depending on the particular skills. The man-month rate for
specialists under the training program is estimated at US$13,000 for train-
ing specialists and US$4,500 for instructors. The man-month rates include
salaries, travel, allowances and local costs and taxes.
46.      Price contingencies have been provided for local costs on the
basis of annual increases of 15 percent for 1983 and 1984, and 12 percent
for 1985 and 1986; and for foreign costs on the basis of 8 percent for 1983
and 1984, and 7 percent for 1985 and 1986.  Including contingencies, the
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$51.2 million equivalent or
45 percent of the total cost of the project, net of taxes but including the
front-end fee.
47.      The Bank loan of US$40.0 million would finance 78 percent of the
foreign exchange component and the Borrower would finance the remaining
22 percent together with the local cost estimated at US$69.9 million or
58 percent of the project cost.



- 13 -
Implementation
48.      The project would be implemented over a period of three years and
would be completed by March 31,1986, with a closing date of September 30,
1986. NRZ would be responsible for the implementation of the project.
Based on previous experience in the ongoing Transport Rehabilitation Im-
ports Program Loan, NRZ is fully competent to carry out these duties. The
Deputy General Manager of NRZ would have overall responsibility for the ad-
ministration of the project.
Procurement
49.      Contracts for spare parts and training equipment would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines for procurement, except as follows: (a) contracts
for teaching equipment costing less than US$50,000 each (the total aggre-
gate not exceeding US$500,000); (b) proprietary spare parts which are only
available from the original manufacturers or authorized suppliers (the
total aggregate not exceeding US$5.0 milLion). Contracts for items under
(a) above will be on the basis of local competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Contracts for the award of spare parts under (b) above will be on the basis
of negotiated contracts on terms satisfactory to the Bank. Items will be
grouped to the extent practicable to pernit bulk procurement. Lists of
spare parts and teaching equipment, including tender documents, will be
reviewed and approved by Bank staff (para. 43).
50.      Consultants for the pre-investment studies will be selected in
accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that NRZ will approach
firms which have undertaken similar assignments for, and have a good work-
ing relationship with the corporation.
51.      The technical assistance personnel consisting of artisans and
other specialists would be selected on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. Based on previous experience, it is expected that the majority
of the expatriate personnel financed uncer the project will be recruited
from Part II countries.
52.      The program for overseas fellowship training listing students,
their qualifications, courses of study, selected institutions and cost will
be reviewed by the Bank.
Disbursements
53.      The proceeds of the loan will ?be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100 percent of foreign exl3enditures for expatriate
staff (technical assistance) under the staffing and
training program and for overseas fellowships;



- 14 -
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for imported
equipment, spare parts and materials;
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent
of local expenditures for training equipment; and
(d) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent
of local expenditures for consultants to carry out
pre-investment studies.
54.      All disbursements will be fully documented.  The disbursement pro-
file is based on past experience.
Retroactive Financing
55.      Retroactive financing is included for the manpower study used for
the preparation of the project as well as for initial financing of training
consultants scheduled to commence work prior to loan effectiveness. These
items, restricted to expenditures for services incurred after May 31, 1982,
are included in the cost estimate for the project and are not expected to
exceed US$400,000.
Reporting, Auditing and Evaluation
56.      NRZ will maintain records adequate to monitor project implementa-
tioIn and will submit quarterly progress reports in a format agreed with the
Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04 (b)). NRZ will maintain separate
accounts for all expenditures incurred under the project. The records will
be maintained to reflect, in accordance with appropriate accounting prac-
tices, its operations and financial status. An annual audit will be re-
quired for all expenditures financed under the project according to gener-
ally accepted accounting procedures and will be carried out by independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank. Audit reports, including those of NRZ
as a whole, will be submitted to the Bank within six months following the
end of each of the Borrower's fiscal year. Not later than six months after
the loan closing date, the Borrower will provide the Bank with a completion
report evaluating the initial operations, the execution, costs and benefits
of the project, the performance of the Borrower, the Bank and NRZ, and
lessons learned.
Benefits and Risks
57.      The principal benefit anticipated from the proposed loan is that
it will enable NRZ to retain manpower capabilities essential for continued
operation of the railway. Without the technical assistance and training
provided under the project, the operating efficiency and the overall
transport capacity of the railway system would deteriorate sharply.  In
addition, the spare parts component will preserve the railway performance
levels that would otherwise be lost. Substantially reduced railway



- 15 -
capacity and efficiency would have severe adverse effects on the economy
generally and on the economies of neighboring countries dependent on
Zimbabwean transit facilities.
58.      The principal risk in the project is that departures of experi-
enced staff from NRZ may occur at a more rapid rate than presently pro-
jected thus causing vacancies that could not be filled by either available
expatriates or newly-trained Zimbabweans. In that event, NRZ would recruit
additional expatriates and accelerate its training program rather than al-
low the efficiency and capacity of the railway to decline. The Government
recognizes the importance to the economy of Zimbabwe of maintaining the
capability of the railway and is expected, to follow manpower policies con-
sistent with this objective.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.      The draft Loan Agreement between Zimbabwe and the Bank, and the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii), of the
Articles of Agreement are being distribut:ed to the Executive Directors
separately.
60.      Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. The opening of the special account by the Borrower to finance
part of the costs of spare parts and materials and the payment of the first
installment therein will be an additional condition of loan effectiveness.
61.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA FROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of March 31, 1983)
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM Million and US$15 Million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness rate: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program was
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. During the loan and credit period, manufactured
output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a shortfall in
the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstruction of the sector is
unlikely to be achieved.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 Mil-
lion, of June 22, 19M1; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equLpment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipmnent Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 miLlion has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
being processed.
Credit No. 1291-ZIM Small Farm Credit Project: US$30.4 Million, of
November 17, 1982; Effectiveness Date: February 10,
1983; Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The project is providing through AFC seasonal credit for seeds,
fertilizer and chemicals, medium-term credit for farm improvement and
equipment; plus facilities and technical assistance to AFC in support of
its expansion of small farm credit.

Credit No. 1296-ZIM Petroleum Fuels Supply Technical Assistance Project:
US$1.2 Million, of November 17, 1982; Effectiveness
Date: Not yet Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project provides for economic and engineering studies of
petroleum fuels supply options available to Zimbabwe, recommending the
preferred system, taking into account cost, suitability and reliability of
supp:Ly. The study also would recommend improvements in the procurement,
priciLng and internal distribution of petroleum fuels, plus financing
training.
Loan No. 2212-ZIM    Power Project: US$105 Million of February 9, 1983;
Effectiveness Date: Not Yet Effective; Closing Date:
June 30, 1987
The project provides for enhancing electric generating capacity
through extension of the Wankie Thermal Power Station.  It also includes
construction of a transmission line, technical assistance and training.
Loan No. 2239         Manufacturing Export Promotion Project: US$70.6
Million of March 9, 1983; Effectiveness Date:
March 28, 1983; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project provides foreign exchange to finance priority import
requirements of raw materials, spare parts components balancing equipment
and export promotional services for export manufacturing industries.

D. STATUS OF IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of March 31, 1983)
Wankie Colliery Company Limited (WCCL)            552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of WCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In view of the diffi-
culty a rights offering would face in the current stock market environment
in Zimbabwe, the Government has agreed to make an equity investment in the
Company to replace the rights issue. Under the terms negotiated, the Gov-
ernment has subscribed shares equivalent to 40 percent of the Company's
equity and has nominated five out of the ten directors, including the
chairman.

NRZ' Expatriate Assistance Requirements for Artisans
NRZ' estimated requirements of expatriate assistance up to 1992 for
railway operations based on retirements, estimated departure of trained staff,
recruitments and estimated graduation from NPZ' training school. The balance shown
in the tables has to be covered by recruitment of overseas staff on a contract
basis. Figures within brackets show a temporary over-recruitment of staff due to
specific backlog of work to be done.. Taking into consideration that certain
contracts would be extended from the previous project, the total number of
man-months to be financed under this project amounts to 11,500.

RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
NRZ' Spare Parts Requirements for Equipment Maintenance Program
1.        Satisfactory performance of NRZ during the project period will
depend on the availability of sufficient railway equipment in good working
order and this equipment availability, in turn, depends heavily on the
ability of NRZ to carry out an adequate equipment maintenance program. A
particularly critical element in such a program is the inventory of spare
parts, especially parts for diesel locomotives which require payment in
foreign exchange.
2.        In the past three years, NRZ' annual requirements for spare parts
have been fairly constant as follows:
Local   Foreign   Total
Z$ Million------
Diesel Locomotive Spares        3.08       5.73    8.81
Steam Locomotive Spares         1.63       0.07    1.70
Carriage and Wagon Spares
and General Spares          11.88       0.94 * 12.82
TOTAL              16.59       6.74   23.33
* Of which Z$0.77 million represents general spares.
3.        NRZ finances all spare parts from its own funds, but requires
foreign exchange from the Government to procure spare parts from abroad.
The diesel locomotive accounts for a very high proportion of total require-
ments for railway spare parts.
4.         The above level of consumption is related to a traffic volume of
about 13.0 million net tons per year, for which NRZ requires some 235
diesel locomotives and 25 electric locomotives, all in good working condi-
tion; the consumption of spare parts for electric locomotives is expected
to be negligible during the project period. Assuming a continuation of the
present traffic level of about 13.0 million net tons, the overall locomo-
tive spare parts requirement should not change significantly from that ex-
perienced in the recent past and this continued supply of parts is expected
to achieve diesel locomotive availability of about 75 percent during the
project period.

ANNEX IX
Page 2 of 3
5.        Spare parts are used for preventive maintenance at depots and
workshops, and for other repairs.  NRZ' preventive maintenance program is
standard for all diesel locomotives, and is summarized in the following
table. Based on the estimated traffic level indicated before, the annual
production of all diesel locomotives is approximately 18.0 million locomo-
tive kilometers. The number of services as well as the foreign costs for
part:s during the project period are also shown in the following table:
Spare Parts
Frequency                Number of  Foreign Cost
Service      (km)      Location   Services   (Z$ Million)
A         5,000    Depot         2,960             1.1
B         15,000    Depot          750             0.5
C        30,000    Depot           360             0.5
D        60,000    Depot           330             0.6
E       225,000
and
675,000    Workshop        130            3.6
F       450,000
* and
900,000    Workshop        100            8.0
6.        For the project period from September 1983 to March 1986 (30
months), the following funds are required for spare parts:
Local   Foreign   Total
Z$ Million------
Diesel Locomotive Spares        7.70      14.33   22.03
Steam Locomotive Spares         4.08       0.18    4.26
Other Spares                   29.70       2.35   32.05
TOTAL                      41.48      16.86   58.34
7.        Of the Z$14.33 million foreign exchange needed for diesel locomo-
tive parts, Z$8.60 million is for diesel engine spares, Z$2.15 million for
underframes and ancillary equipment, and Z$3.58 million for diesel electric
spares.  For all spare parts, the total funds required, converted to US
Dollars are as follows:
US$ Million
Local Procurement              45.21
Foreign Procurement            18.38
TOTAL                      63.59

ANNEX IX

8.        The procurement of spare parts from abroad, consisting primarily
of locomotive parts, will require financing of about US$20.0 million. The
proposed Bank loan includes US$10.0 million of this total; NRZ will finance
the balance for which it will require foreign exchange from the Govern-
ment. To secure NRZ' requirements for foreign exchange, the Government
will open an NRZ account into which the Government will make installment
payments of foreign exchange. The first installment will be required as a
condition of loan effectiveness. During implementation, each application
for procurement of spare parts and materials shall be approved by the
Bank. Upon such approvals, the Borrower will promptly replenish the
special account until th aggregate amount of the initial deposit and sub-
sequent replenishments reach US$10.0 million.
