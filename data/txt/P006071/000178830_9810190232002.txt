FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Barlbados
Amount:              US$9.0 million
Terms:               Payable in 15 years, including three years of grace at
7.35% per annum.
Project
Description:         The project aims to:  enhance the effectiveness and
efficiency of the education system; make possible the
effective application of modern and relevant curricula;
provide more equitable distribution of education oppor-
tunity; and improve cost effectiveness in the education
system. The project provides assistance in institution
building for management and execution of education
programs; complements and strengthens existing programs
for management training and advisory services to small-
scale enterprises; and introduces an in-plant workers'
training program.
The project consists of:
(a)  construction, furnishing and equipping of ten pri-
mary schools which will replace 5,880 existing
student places in obsolescent schools;
(b), (i)  construction, furnishing and equipping of
expansion to six secondary schools to provide
facilities for the teaching of practical courses
for some 2,600 student places, of which 1,500
are additional and 1,100 are replacement places;
(ii) equipping and furnishing of a secondary
school presently under construction;
(c)  construction, furnishing and equipping of an expansion
of Erdiston Teacher Training College to function
also as a teacher training resource center for the
continuing education of practicing teachers;
(d)  construction, furnishing and equipping of an expan-
sion to the Barbados Institute of Management and
Productivity (BIMAP) to help establish an in-plant
training program and advisory services to small-
scale enterprises;
This documnent has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- ii -
(e) technical assistance to the Ministry of Education
(MOE) for project implementation and to BIMAP for
initiating the in-plant training program.
The project entails no special risks except perhaps that
the Government may initially encounter resistance in in-
troducing targets for economic class sizes and teacher-
student ratios. This resistance, if it materializes, is
expected to be considerably diluted as the project allows
the Government to move towards these targets on a stage-
by-stage basis. i.e., the project schools as they are
completed in 1980, 1981 and 1982 will be the first to
introduce these norms: the rest of the schools will
follow later.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BARBADOS
FOR A FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$9.0 million to Barbados for an education project.
The loan would have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 7.35% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report (Economic Memorandum on Barbados, Report No.
1618a-BB, dated March 31, 1978) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on April 5, 1978. Annex 1 contains the basic country data.
Background
3.        Barbados is arnong the most densely populated countries in the world,
with a total area of 166 square miles and a population of 247,000. Its loca-
tion is somewhat isolated, as it lies in the southeastern Caribbean, some 100
miles east of the smaller islands of St. Vincent and St. Lucia, its nearest
neighbors, and about 350 miles north of the coast of South America. The
island is small even by Caribbean standards, being less than one-tenth the
size of Trinidad and Tobago. It is one of the more developed countries of
the Caribbean Common Market. Its per capita income in 1977, US$1,760 (accord-
ing to the World Bank Atlas definition), is the second highest in the region,
behind that of Trinidad and Tobago (US$2,380). Its relatively high income,
the smallness of the island and its relative isolation from the rest of the
Caribbean have contributed to the building of a rather homogeneous, close-
knit society, with a long history of constitutional government. The country,
which had been a British colony, attained self-government in 1961 and became
a sovereign state in November 1966. Barbados joined the Bank in September
1974.
4.        While the country's natural resource base is limited, the available
resources are utilized in a relatively efficient manner. Soil, topography
and rainfall patterns are ideally suited for growing sugarcane, which is the
main agricultural product. There are no known metallic mineral deposits.
However, pockets of petroleum and natural gas at present supply about one-
third of the domestic energy consumption needs. A major strength of the
country is its tolerant and well-educated populace. Perhaps the island's
most valuable natural resources are its beautiful beaches and mild weather,
which now attract close to 300,000 tourists annually and have permitted
tourism to develop as one of the two most dynamic sectors of the economy,
the other being manufacturing.
5.        The international recession has recently evoked apprehension over
the perils of excessive! reliance on a single sector, tourism, for future



-2-
growth. The result has been a redirection of both public and private effort
increasingly into manufacturing. The Barbados Industrial Development Corpora-
tion (BIDC), in particular, has been the prime vehicle for attracting private
capital and launching new industrial enterprises in the country. The current
strategy, as it pertains to the manufacturing sector, can be expected to
entail continued effort on the part of BIDC in its search for, and promotion
of, new ventures. The key bottleneck to the development of the sector, how-
ever, continues to be a lack of skilled manpower. The educational system
places too little emphasis on technical and vocational training as compared
with secondary general education.
6.        Barbados possesses a relatively well developed infrastructure.
The road system provides ready access to virtually every corner of the island.
As a result of a rapid growth in private motor vehicles, however, road con-
gestion is becoming a serious problem; there is need for improvements in the
public transportation system. A large jet-accommodating airport and deepwater
harbor supply air and sea transportation services for the country as well as
for the nearby islands. Power generation capacity, although adequate at
present, could pose increasing problems by the early 1980s when the peak
demand is forecast to exceed the present generating plant load-carrying
capability unless new investments are umdertaken to meet the emerging genera-
ting gap. The Government has systematically pursued distribution-oriented
policies geared to meet the basic needs of the population by increasing
education, health and housing services. Nevertheless, further efforts in
this direction are still required, especially for the poorer segments of the
population.
7.        Unemployment in Barbados is a grave problem that not only is a
drain on the country's resources but is also socially debilitating. Although
the unemployment rate is estimated to have declined from above 20% in 1975
to around 12.5% in mid-1978, the problem continues to be serious. At the same
time, the island suffers from shortages in certain key skills. To ameliorate
unemployment in the future, therefore, manpower training schemes must accom-
pany increased investment in employment-generating activities. Population
growth has traditionally been substantially lower than 1% per annum because
of a successful family planning program and high migration to seek employment
opportunities elsewhere. In recent years, restrictions on emigration by the
United States, United Kingdom and Canada have severely curtailed emigration.
As a result, future population growth is expected to be at a rate of about
1.2% per annum. Distribution of income in Barbados is not excessively uneven.
Statistics compiled from income recipients for 1969/70 show that the proportion
of total income accruing to the poorest 40% was 18.6%, while the top 20% of
income recipients received 44%.
Recent Economic Developments
8.        The structure of economic activity in Barbados changed substan-
tially in recent times with the sugar industry losing its predominant position
in the economy to the fast-growing tourist, manufacturing and government
sectors. The leading sector in the economy at present is the tourist sector
which together with its ancillary service activities generates about one-
third of GDP and accounts for about half of the foreign exchange earnings.



- 3 -
The Government and manufacturing sectors follow with 16% and 11% of GDP
respectively. Sugar now accounts for less than 7% of GDP compared with 33%
in the 1950s. Prolonged periods of dry weather combined with rising labor
costs and weak international prices have been responsible for a decline in
sugar production from the 1967 level of over 200,000 tons to an estimated
100,000 tons in 1978.
9.        Because of its narrow resource base and limited internal market,
Barbados is highly dependent on the external sector of its economy. In
1977, imports and exports of goods and nonfactor services were equivalent to
about 70% and 60% of GDP respectively. Food imports constitute roughly one-
half of domestic food consumption, a large portion of which is utilized to
cover the needs of the tourist sector.
10.       After a period of dynamic growth between 1966 and 1970--8.5% per
capita per annum--real GDP grew modestly during the early 1970s, primarily
because of the poorer performance of the tourist industry in the latter
period. During this period the country began to experience increasing
balance of payments and budgetary problems accompanied by rising unemploy-
ment and accelerating inflation. Sharp increases in international prices
associated with rising energy costs triggered unprecedented annual average
increases in the retail price index of almost 40% in 1974 and about 20% in
1975. In these two years, the economic situation deteriorated further with
real GDP declining at an average annual rate of about 1%. The major cause was
the economic recession in the industrial countries combined with increasing
prices for Barbados imports. Per capita income declined by an average of
about 2% p.a. during these two years.
11.       The economy recovered relatively well in 1976 and 1977 with real
GDP growth averaging about 5% per annum, the main impetus coming from tourism,
manufacturing and construction. The renewed growth resulted from a rise in
tourism arrivals and length of stay, increased investment promotion efforts
and use of idle manufacturing capacity, as well as an increase in the number
of both private and public sector construction projects. In addition, the
performance of the agricultural sector was enhanced as improved weather
conditions for sugar led to higher yields and output increases of 5% and
15% in these two years, but most of this improvement was lost in 1978 when the
sugar crop was poor and nonsugar agriculture could not take up the slack.
Inflation fell to 5% in 1976 after the realignment of the Barbadian dollar
with the US dollar, but increased to 8.4% in 1977 and about the same rate this
year as a result of rising import prices, a prolonged drought in the agricul-
tural sector and sizable overall wage increases in public sector salaries
awarded in 1976 and again in 1978.
12.       With the exception of a short period in the mid-1970s the capacity
of the public sector to finance its investment expenditure has declined over
the past several years. Public sector savings fell sharply in 1973-74, in-
creased in 1975 as a result of higher sugar prices but declined to 2.9% and
2.7% of GDP in 1976 and 1977, respectively. Current budgetary revenue of the
Central Government grew relatively fast during the 1973-78 period (tax revenue
buoyancy to GDP was 1.2) but current budgetary expenditure over the same



- 4 -
period increased even more rapidly. The major reasons for the increase in
current spending have been wage adjustments of public service employees and
growth of subsidies to public enterprises providing social services (public
transport, housing, sanitation). In early 1978 the Government introduced
measures aimed at reversing the declining trend in public savings by increasing
revenues and curbing expenditures. These measures included increases in cor-
porate and personal income taxes, in withholding taxes, and in consumption
taxes. However, wage increases to public sector employees have been nearly
twice as high as originally envisaged by the Government and current expenditures
in 1978 are expected to increase almost as much as revenues.  Following rapid
expansion of public investment in recent years, capital expenditure is likely
to level off in 1978 as the Government has attempted to curb new investment
for which no external financing has been obtained. While part of the public
sector's deficit has been financed by foreign project loans, a portion has
also been financed by the domestic banking system including in some years a
substantial share by the Central Bank.
13.       A lasting improvement in public finances requires a reduction in
current expenditure growth. Acceleration in revenue growth is unlikely in
the immediate future as the tax effort is already relatively high. Increased
tax revenue has been obtained from the income and profit taxes. Adoption
of a common external tariff by CARICOM, however, has severely limited customs
duties as a source of additional government revenue. Domestic consumption
taxes, property taxes and user charges for public services, therefore, appear
to be the only sources of additional revenue and the Government does not
believe it can introduce changes in these taxes in the immediate future.
The Government is aware of the need to strengthen public finances and is at
present studying alternatives for reversing the decline of public sector
savings.
14.       The balance of payments has been under continuous pressure since
the early 1970s, reflecting the deterioration in the Government's financial
position and foreign market developments. In the wake of the upturn in
domestic economic activity after 1975, imports surged. Imports grew rapidly
because of accelerating wage increases, expansionary government spending and
easily obtainable consumer credit. Adverse movements in the terms of trade
as a result of declining sugar prices after their 1975 peak reduced export
earnings. As a result, a large current account deficit equivalent to nearly
17% of GDP was registered in 1976. External capital inflows were not suf-
ficient to cover the large current account deficit, and by year-end inter-
national reserves declined to the equivalent of less than one month's imports
of goods and nonfactor services. In order to stem this decline in foreign
exchange reserves, the Government introduced measures in 1977 aimed at curb-
ing consumer goods imports. Quantitative restrictions on imports of consumer
durables were expanded and consumer credit was restricted. Simultaneously
foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased rapidly with the result that
the current account deficit in the balance of payments declined to 11% of
GDP. For 1978, the recorded deficit is expected to decline to about 9% of
GDP. This deficit, however, is probably over-stated, as the balance of
payments contains large errors and omissions, a substantial proportion of
which is assumed to be attributable to tourism. While the 1977 and 1978
deficits represent a substantial improvement over the large 1976 deficit,
substantial external borrowing from foreign commercial banks and utilization
of IMF compensatory financing had to be used to prevent further loss of
foreign exchange reserves.



-5-
Growth Prospects
15.       The economy appears to have the potential to attain growth of about
5% per annum over the next several years. Relatively high rates of growth of
tourism and manufacturing are likely to be sustained in the future, but there
is also significant growth potential in nonsugar agriculture (fruits and
vegetables) and in fisheries. Given the expected composition of this growth,
this would make possible a decline in unemployment to under 10% by the early
1980s.  In order to sustain such growth over the medium term without an un-
desirably large buildup of external debt, however, the Government will have
to bring about an increase in national savings and a further reduction in the
current deficit of the balance of payments. As in the past, future economic
growth will have to be export led and this in turn will depend on the Govern-
ment's ability to contain wage increases so that the international competitive-
ness of Barbadian labor is maintained. The Government's short-term strategy
for coping with balance of payments difficulties will continue to emphasize
growth in tourism and export manufacturing, supported by credit and import
controls.
16.       The Government is currently preparing a five-year development
plan for 1979-83 aimed at increasing productivity and at sustaining adequate
rates of growth of national income. It is expected that this plan will place
high priority on growtht and diversification of exports of goods and services.
In tourism, the Governnient's principal objectives are to increase occupancy
rates during the summer season and to improve the retained value added of the
industry. A reinforced and reorganized export promotion agency is to provide
a complementary vehicle! for the promotion and marketing of manufactured
products abroad. Agricultural production is to satisfy a growing proportion
of domestic demand and stronger linkages to the tourism sector are to be
developed, thus reducing the mounting food import bill.
17.       The Government's development strategy is based on maintaining a
mixed economy with the private sector playing a major role accompanied by
active public sector support. Education and manpower training are expected
to form an integral part of the Government's program, since the development
of skilled manpower wi:Ll help to accelerate growth of industry and non-
traditional agriculture.  Improvements in physical infrastructure including
power-generating capac:Lty are to support the development of the productive
sectors of the economy.
18.       With a public external debt service ratio of 3.4% in 1977 and
debt outstanding and disbursed amounting to US$46 million (10.3% of GDP)
at the end of 1977, Barbados has modest external public indebtedness. The
current external debt profile is relatively favorable and is expected to
continue to be so if the Government moves to reverse the declining trend of
public savings and to reduce the large current account deficit in the balance
of payments. In light of its moderate debt burden and favorable growth
prospects and provided that measures to raise national savings are taken in
due course, Barbados may be expected to remain creditworthy for loans on
conventional terms.



-6-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
19.       Barbados became a Bank member in 1974.  The proposed education
project would be the Bank's first lending operation. The current lending
program includes also an $8.0 million loan for a proposed tourism development
project. In addition, Barbados has benefited from the Bank's lending to the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). So far, a loan of $2.6 million from IBRD
resources was made by the CDB to Barbados in September 1978 for a relatively
small industrial development project.
20.       The Bank has maintained a continuing dialogue with the Government
on its economic policies and development priorities. The Bank organized last
June a subgroup of donors under the auspices of the Caribbean Group for Coop-
eration in Economic Development to coordinate financial and technical aid to
Barbados. At the first meeting of the subgroup in June 1978, multilateral and
bilateral donors expressed substantial interest in financing specific priority
projects and in providing technical assistance to Barbados. In addition, in
light of Barbados' difficulties in the balance of payments and public finances,
the Group recommended that the country receive an allocation of US$7 million
from the Caribbean Development Facility (CDF). 1/ To date, a balance of
payments loan of f 850,000 (US$1.65 million) has been made by the UK, and
the US and Canada have pledged assistance of US$1.5 million each within the
CDF framework.
21.       In the future, the Bank's lending to Barbados either directly or
indirectly through the CDB will be mainly directed towards projects for diver-
sified agricultural production, power generation and urban development. This
is in line with the Government's strategy to reduce the mounting import food
bill while satisfying the needs of the local population and of the tourism
sector, to improve the living conditions of the urban poor and to increase the
present power-generating capacity of the country in order to meet increasing
demand requirements.
22.       It is estimated that by 1982 the Bank's share in Barbados' public
external debt outstanding and disbursed will be about 3%. The Bank's share
in the external public debt service will also be about 3%.
1/   The Caribbean Development Facility was established during the First Meet-
ing of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development, held
at Bank headquarters, June 19-24, 1978. It is a transitional emergency
financing facility to cover local costs and cost overruns of development
projects in Caribbean countries, including Barbados. It is planned to
be phased out over a maximum period of five years. Financing offered
within the facility framework is expected to provide over US$100 million
during FY79 to the countries of the Caribbean. The major contributors
are the US, UK, Canada, Venezuela and the OPEC Special Fund.



-7-
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Background
23.       The Barbados education system is relatively highly developed.
Literacy stands at 99% (1976); over 90% of the labor force has had at least
six years of education and 75% had at least nine years. The Government con-
siders its well educated labor force as one of its main assets in developing
the productive sectors of the economy. The present education system, however,
places a high recurrent cost burden on the Government; public expenditures
on education reached a high 8.1% of GNP or 22.1% of public sector expendi-
tures in 1976, partly because of inefficiencies in the education system.
High teacher-student ratios and excessive maintenance costs due to inadequate
and obsolescent physical infrastructure are the main factors for the rela-
tively high recurrent costs. The Government is committed to take the appro-
priate steps to improve efficiency, equity and quality of the education system
in conjunction with measures to increase its cost effectiveness.
24.       External aid through bilateral and multilateral agencies has been
a significant factor in the development in recent years of the education
sector in Barbados. In 1972 IDB approved a US$2.8 million loan for the
construction and equipment of the Community College; the project has been
completed. In 1976 IDB approved a loan of US$6.6 million for rebuilding
and expanding the Polytechnic; construction is expected to start in 1979.
Out of a total $32 million public investment program in education for
1978-81, the Government is expected to finance about 50%; the IDB, through
the loan referred to above, would contribute about 22%, and the proposed
Bank loan about 28%.
Overview of the Education Sector
25.       The Ministry of Education (MOE) has jurisdiction over almost all
education activities. The formal education system consists of six years of
primary, five to seven years of secondary; and three to five years of higher
education.
26.       The net enrollment rates are remarkably high--virtually complete
registration of the primary school age group and the equivalent of 84% of the
relevant secondary school age group. There is no disparity between male and
female participation. Promotion and progression rates are very high and the
dropout rate is negligible. These impressive achievements have been realized
without compulsory educa,tion laws.
27.       The majority of the schools, however are inadequate and obsolescent;
they do not allow for the effective application of the recently developed,
practically oriented curricula that meet the requirements of the Regional
Caribbean Examinations Council, and require excessive maintenance costs. They
are also the main reason for relatively small class sizes which cause high
teacher-student ratios and high recurrent costs. Furthermore, the present
system retains the academically less capable children in the primary schools
for lack of places in the secondary schools. These children are referred to
in the educational system as the "all age tops." The elimination of the "all
age tops" is a matter of priority to the Government.



28.       The new curricula also make demands upon the content of teacher edu-
cation. The Erdiston Teacher Training College is not fully equipped to under-
take some of the new types of courses and activities which should become part
of the modern education curriculum. Also a small expansion is necessary to
increase intake in order to clear the backlog of unqualified teachers in the
schools (about 25%), to upgrade, retrain and reorient the present qualified
teachers' school principals and education administrators and gradually to
introduce a preservice course for new teachers and potential principals. In
this respect, advisory services to teachers and tools and facilities to pre-
pare their own materials and aids are also necessary.
29.       Presently there is too little technical and vocational training in
the secondary schools as compared with general education. This imbalance is
being partly remedied by two IDB projects: the upper secondary-level Poly-
technic which trains skilled workers and provides part-time and nonformal
courses, and the post secondary Community College which trains technicians
in engineering trades, tourism and business. The Polytechnic project also
provides for technical assistance to support the MOE Planning Unit. Manage-
ment training has been carried out by the Barbados Institute for Management
and Productivity (BIMAP). The activities of BIMAP need to be expanded to meet
the demand for additional management and supervisory staff training, and to
provide in-plant worker training and technical and advisory services to small-
scale enterprises. This together with regional facilities that provide train-
ing in agricultural extension, animal health, fisheries and paramedics, and
the two IDB-sponsored projects mentioned above are expected to cover adequately
most of the foreseeable needs for vocational training.
Government's Strategy for Educational Development
30.       The Government with technical assistance from other agencies has
developed during recent years modern and relevant curricula that are geared
to the needs of Barbados and fully meet the requirements of the Regional
Caribbean Examination Council. The main objectives of the Government's
policy for the development of the education sector are: (a) modernization
and redirection of the educational content and the physical facilities of the
education system to make it a more productive development tool through greater
emphasis on vocational training and on technical, science and other practical
studies; (b) the equalization of educational opportunity through extension of
education to all, at least up to age 16; and (c) increased training programs
tailored to Barbadian industrial and economic development needs. The strat-
egy is to achieve these objectives in conjunction with measures to increase
the efficiency of the education system and its cost effectiveness.
Bank's Role in Education and Training
31.       Bank support through this first education project in Barbados
focusses on assisting the Government in applying more rapidly and effectively
its strategy of combining measures to assure equity and relevant general
education and skill training with measures to enhance the cost-effectiveness
of the system. This would be achieved by provision of the appropriate facil-
ities in which well-trained teachers can effectively apply the modern and



relevant curricula. The project aims at replacing the existing facilities
and in some cases, at modifying and expanding the existing installations. The
execution of the project would introduce quality improvements linked with such
cost-effective measures as larger but reasonable class sizes, more economic
teacher-student ratios, economic norms and standards in building design and
systems, more rational use of resources through improved administrative and
organizational practices, and multi-purpose use of all practical facilities.
Expansion of existing schools will provide the appropriate facilities for
the teaching of practical courses and will increase the intake capacity of the
secondary schools enabling them to accommodate the majority of the output of
the primary schools, thus almost eliminating the inequitable "all-age tops."
32.       In determining the content of the project in line with the above
objectives and strategy, account has been taken of the assistance provided by
other agencies--IDB in vocational training and the MOE Planning Unit, OAS in
curriculum development, and CIDA to BIMAP for advisory services to small-scale
enterprises.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report on a First Education
Project Barbados" (No. 2220b-BB, dated November 20, 1978) is being distributed
separately. Annex III contains a timetable of key events in processing the
project and a description of the special conditions of the proposed loan.
Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in Washington, D.C. on October
25-26, 1978. The Barbaclian delegation was led by Mr. Erskine Rawlins, Chief
Education Officer.
Objectives and CompositiLon
34.       The objectives of the proposed project are to support government
policy to redirect the emphasis of the educational content and teaching
methodologies in the schools, to remove inequities in the education system,
and to initiate cost-effectiveness measures. The project will be the
first step toward initiating cost effectiveness measures in the education
system through the introduction of functional design of classroom spaces,
use of appropriate building materials and systems, school organizational
practices, and norms and standards for equipment and furniture (Section
3.01 of Loan Agreement). The class size in the project schools will be
designed to accommodate an increased number of students (about 35) which
will lead to more economical teacher-student ratios and reductions in
recurrent costs. The Government will achieve these targets through
a prudent teacher hiring and training policy and the normal attrition
of teachers. The project also complements the assistance being provided
by other development institutions in the area of institution building,
particularly with a view to strengthening the national capability in
management and execution of education programs, and in the organization
and conduct of nonformal management and in-plant worker training and
advisory services to small enterprises. Specifically, the proposed
project would comprise:



- 10 -
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of ten primary
schools. This component will provide about 5,880 student
places, which will replace existing places in obsolescent
schools. The new facilities include spaces and equipment
to facilitate the teaching of the well balanced primary
school curriculum which includes elementary science and
agriculture, crafts, basic home crafts and health educa-
tion. The schools would operate with reasonable class
size of about 35 and teacher-student ratio of about 1:29,
compared with the present class size of 22 to 30 and a
teacher-student ratio of 1:21. The Government has agreed
to apply both norms in the project schools as they become
operational and to the rest of the system's schools sub-
sequently in accordance with a time schedule to be agreed
upon with the Bank. (Section 3.04 of Loan Agreement). The
Government has also agreed to provide training and employ-
ment to qualified primary school teachers for remedial work
in each new primary school, to ensure that slow learners are
given a chance to make the necessary progress (Section 3.04
of Loan Agreement).
(b) construction, furnishing and equipping of expansions to
six existing secondary schools. This component will pro-
vide facilities for the teaching of science, industrial
arts, home economics, agriculture and business courses
for some 2,600 student places, of which 1,500 are addi-
tional and 1,100 replacement places. In addition, one
secondary school which is presently under construction with
about 1,250 student places will be furnished and equipped
under the project. The additional student places provided
by the project will make it possible for the equivalent of
about 70% of children presently left behind in the primary
schools "all-age tops" to enter secondary schools. The
project schools will also help pioneer the move towards a
more rational use of resources in the education sector. The
Government agreed to operate the project schools with a
reasonable class size of about 35 and teacher-student ratio
of about 1:23 (Section 3.04 of Loan Agreement), and to
undertake appropriate measures, aimed at achieving maximum
cost effectiveness through functional design of classroom
spaces, use of appropriate building materials and systems,
school organizational practices, and norms and standards for
equipment and furniture (Section 3.01 of Loan Agreement).
(c) construction, furnishing and equipping of the expansion
of Erdiston Teacher Training College. This component
will provide appropriate facilities to enable the Erdiston
Teacher Training College to undertake the function of a
teacher education resource center for the continuing edu-
cation of practicing teachers, and to train teachers in
the practical subjects which now figure prominently in



- 11 -
the curricula of primary and secondary schools. It would
also enable the college to expand its regular and in-
service courses for primary and secondary school teachers
and accommodate an increased intake of teachers (150
instead of 120 in its regular courses and 200 instead of
180 in its in-service course). The facilities to be pro-
vided include a well stocked reference and study library,
a                     a demonstration micro-teaching area, a lecture theater, a
well equipped general workshop and a learning-teaching aids
design and production area. The Government has agreed to
make resources available for the necessary additional staff
which are to be appointed in accordance with a time schedule
satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.05 of Loan Agreement).
(d) construction, furnishing and equipping of an expansion
to the Barbados Institute of Management and Productivity
(BIMAP). This component will help establish an in-plant
training program and strengthen an advisory services
program to small-scale enterprises. These programs are
expected to reach about 1,500 workers and 480 middle-
management personnel annually. BIMAP would also assist
large firms in setting up viable training programs within
their own establishments. The Government has agreed to make
facilities available to BIMAP from time to time for special
short BIMAP training courses (Section 3.06 of Loan Agreement)
and to insure that BIMAP would appoint the required
additional staf'f and submit annual evaluation reports of
BIMAP activities to the Bank beginning in 1981 until
completion of the project (Section 3.06 of Loan Agreement).
(e) provision of services of architectural consultants and
other specialists. This component will provide: about 12
manyears of architectural and other support services to the
project unit; fellowships for about 30 manmonths in support
of BIMAP for in-plant training, and advisory services to
small-scale enterprises, programs; and technical assistance
to the MOE to undertake special intensive training courses
for key school and MOE administrative staff during 1980, 1981
and 1982 (Sections 3.02 and 3.07 of Loan Agreement).  It
takes into account the considerable assistance already being
provided by other agencies and the fact that Barbados has
substantial expertise of its own in the MOE or in other
government agencies which can be utilized for the project.
The Government has agreed to submit specific proposals for
the fellowship program to the Bank for review by June 30,
1979 (Section 3.08 of Loan Agreement); consultant and spe-
cialist services will be appointed under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.02 of Loan Agreement).

Project Costs and Financing
35.       The total project cost is estimated at US$14.5 million, including
physical contingencies of US$1.1 million and price contingencies of US$2.3 mil-
lion. Physical contingencies amount to 10% for all project components; price
contingencies represent an average of 18.4% of the base cost plus physical
contingencies. Imported equipment and furniture would be exempt from customs
duties and are costed accordingly. Specialist services and fellowships,
representing US$0.6 million of total project costs, are estimated at an aver-
age of US$34,000 and US$20,000 per manyear, respectively. The proposed Bank
loan of US$9 million would finance 62% of the project costs, which represents
the equivalent of the estimated foreign exchange costs. The balance of project
costs would be borne by the Government.
Recurrent Costs
36.       The overall impact of the project will result in considerable sav-
ings in recurrent costs when compared with the present less efficient system.
The recurrent costs generated by the primary and secondary school components
of the project would be about 11% less than if the same enrollments would
attend schools with the present class sizes and average teacher-student ratios.
This savings already takes into account higher nonsalary costs (materials,
etc.) in project schools due to the increased practical work in laboratories
and workshops. The teacher training component would cause an increase in
annual recurrent expenditures of only $80,000 over the 1977-80 level. The
expanded activities of BIMAP would double its 1977-78 level of expenditures
by 1982. BIMAP, however, expects that the fees charged for services rendered
would cover about 90% of the annual recurrent expenditures. The Government
would contribute the remaining 10%, which means that the Government contribu-
tion would remain at its present level of $40,000 (at 1977 prices). The
Government agreed that all equipment, furniture and buildings financed under
the proposed project would be adequately maintained and repaired and that it
would take all necessary steps to make funds available in the event of any
shortfall in revenues needed to cover BIMAP's operational expenses (Section
3.01 of Loan Agreement).
Project Implementation
37.       The project would be implemented by a Project Unit which would be
established within the MOE. A full time Project Manager acceptable to the
Bank will be responsible for the implementation of the project and will report
directly to the Permanent Secretary of the MOE (Section 3.03 of Loan Agreement).
The Project Unit would include, besides the Project Manager, three architects,
one quantity surveyor, one structural engineer, one accountant and adequate
support staff (Schedule 5 of Loan Agreement). The Curriculum Development
Section and the operational divisions of the MOE would provide the Project
Manager with assistance on educational matters including preparation of equip-
ment lists as required (Section 3.03 of Loan Agreement). The BIMAP component
would be executed by the Executive Trustee of BIMAP with the assistance of
consultants procured through the construction division of the Barbados Indus-
trial Development Corporation to which BIMAP is closely connected. All



- 13 -
accounting, however, would be the responsibility of the Project Manager. The
Government has agreed to provide suitable premises and make the rerjiitred
personnel available to the Project Unit (Section 3.03 of Loan Agreement).
38.       All sites for the project schools would be acquired by March 31,
1979 (Section 3.12 of Loan Agreement). Design drawings, equipment and furni-
ture lists and all contractual documents and procedures would be submitted for
Bank approval before finalization and procurement action (Section 3.10 of Loan
Agreement). An implementation schedule has been prepared which the Project
Manager would update regularly. Project schools would be designed to require
the minimum routine maintenance. The Government would prepare a maintenance
handbook to assure proper maintenance of the project facilities.
Procurement
39.       Contracts for civil works and the procurement of furniture and
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines except that civil works contracts of under
$100,000 and furniture and equipment which cannot be grouped into packages of
at least US$50,000 would be procured on the basis of local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The total cost of furniture and equipment
procured in this manner will not in the aggregate exceed US$300,000 (equivalent
to about 12% of the estimated total cost of furniture and equipment). For
civil works, the aggregate amount to be procured in this manner will not
exceed US$500,000.  In the case of procurement under international competitive
bidding procedures, domestic manufacturers tendering under international
procedures would receive a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost or
the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, and regional preferences for
other members of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) would be limited to 15%
of the c.i.f. price of nonregional goods or the difference in tariffs, which-
ever is lower.
Disbursements
40.       Disbursements of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be made for
(a) 50% of total expenditures for civil works: (b) 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for imported, or 85% of expenditures for locally procured furniture and
equipment; and (c) 100% of total expenditures for technical assistance and
professional fees.
41.       Retroactive financing not exceeding US$200,000 would cover expendi-
tures incurred after August 1, 1978 to equip the new premises of the School
Buildings and Maintenance Section and for consultant services incurred in
bringing the project to an advanced stage of readiness.
Benefits and Risks
42.       The project would (a) provide a more effective learning-teachiTlg
environment for almost 6,000 primary and over 7,000 secondary school students
in the schools (representing about 16% of total enrollments in 1935 in primary
and 35% in general secondary education); (b) redress through the program for



- 14 -
secondary school expansion inequities in the education system by eliminating
the primary "all-age tops" to which over 3,000, mainly rural children, are
presently relegated; (c) develop the model, norms and standards, to increase
the efficiency of the education system and its cost effectiveness; (d) support
institution-building in the MOE (teacher education, administration training,
management and execution capability); (e) broaden the range of BIMAP services,
particularly in the area of in-plant training and advisory services to small-
scale enterprises benefiting 1,500 workers and 480 middle-management personnel
annually. Technical assistance inclaided in the project would help ensure
timely and efficient project implementation.
43.       The major risk is that there may initially be considerable resistance
by teachers' unions and parents to the Government targets for an economic class
size and teacher-student ratios. The resistance, if it materializes, should be
overcome in time by: (a) the gradual attrition of teachers; (b) provision of
suitable physical facilities; (c) the gradual introduction of larger class
sizes; and (d) the realization among teachers and parents that the program
will not result in any deterioration of education quality.
Evaluation
44.       The Government has agreed to discuss its educational policies and
plans annually with the Bank and send to the Bank within six months of the
closing date of the loan account a full completion report providing an assess-
ment of all components of the project, their results and the experience gained
during implementation (Section 3.10 of Loan Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between Barbados and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III,
Section 3.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
